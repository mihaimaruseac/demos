Alright, let's walk through this methodically.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the spiral layout**

The description says it’s a **hexagonal grid**, clockwise or counterclockwise spiral starting at center 1.  
The snippet shows:

**Row 1 (top?)** → `... 14 4 3 10 ...` might be more about neighbors arrangement, not a horizontal row in normal grid sense, likely shows part of spatial neighbors.

Second snippet:  
`.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...` suggests 5 is below-left of 1, 2 right of 1, etc., but let's check hex grid coordinates.

---

Hex grid neighbors: each hex has exactly 6 neighbors.  
Spiral: Starting at 1, spiral outward, number increasing.  
We need to find **coordinates** of numbers to deduce neighbors of 2026.

---

Instead of guessing the snippet layout, I recall a known *hexagonal spiral* often called the “Ulam spiral but on hex grid”. Let’s try to infer indexing.

---

Actually, one common hexagonal spiral sequence:  
**Numbers**: 1 in center, around it 2–7 form ring 1 (6 numbers), 8–19 form ring 2 (12 numbers), 20–37 ring 3 (18 numbers), etc.

General: ring \( r \) (r>=1) has \( 6r \) numbers.  
Numbers in ring r: first integer = \( 1 + 3r(r-1) \) maybe? Let's check:

r=1 (first ring = numbers 2..7): formula: \( 1 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 1\) which is wrong (first in ring 2??). Need known formula from OEIS A003215.

Indeed: Central hex numbers = \( 3n(n+1)+1 \)  
This is sequence: 1, 7, 19, 37, ... these are **last numbers of rings**. Wait, let's reverse:

ring 1 = numbers 2..7: last = 7 (n=1)  
ring 2 = numbers 8..19: last = 19 (n=2)  
ring 3 = numbers 20..37: last = 37 (n=3)  
ring 4 = numbers 38..61: last = 61 (n=4)

So last of ring r = \( 3r(r+1)+1 \)? Not quite: For r=2: 3*2*3+1=19 yes. For r=1: 3*1*2+1=7 yes.

First of ring r = last of ring r-1 +1 = \( 3r(r-1)+2 \) maybe.

Check: r=2: 3*2*1+2=8 yes.

---

We need **where 2026 lies**.

---

## **Step 2: Determine ring containing 2026**

Last of ring r = \( 3r(r+1)+1 \).  
First of ring r = \( 3(r-1)r + 2 \).

We find r such that first(r) ≤ 2026 ≤ last(r).

Let’s solve: \( 3(r-1)r + 2 \le 2026 \le 3r(r+1)+1 \).

Check r=26: last = 3*26*27+1 = 3*702+1=2106+1=2107.  
first = 3*25*26+2 = 3*650+2=1950+2=1952. Yes, 2026 is between 1952 and 2107.  
So r=26, but careful: ring numbering: r=0 means just {1}, r=1 means {2..7}, etc. But 2026 is in ring **r=26** in my formula? Let's check smaller:

Last(25)=3*25*26+1=1951, First(26)=1952. Yes. So yes, 2026 is in ring r=26 (if we start r=0 as just {1}).

---

Wait: Actually ring 1 has 6 numbers, index start offset.

Better: Ring r (r>=1) has 6r numbers starting at start = \( 2 + 6 \times (1+2+...+(r-1)) = 2 + 3r(r-1) \).

Because total numbers up to ring r-1 = \( 1 + 3r(r-1) \) maybe? Let's recall standard known:

Number of cells including center and up to ring r = \( 1 + 3r(r+1) \)?? No, known formula for centered hexagonal numbers: \( 3n^2+3n+1 \) = total hex cells from center to ring n.

Check: n=1: 3+3+1=7 (center 1 + ring1=6). Yes.

So up to ring n: total numbers = \( 3n^2+3n+1 \). Therefore ring n (n>=1) contains: from \( 3n(n-1)+2 \) to \( 3n(n+1)+1 \).

Now test: n=1: from 2 to 7, yes. n=2: from 3*2*1+2=8 up to 3*2*3+1=19, yes.

So we find n such that: \( 3n(n-1)+2 \le 2026 \le 3n(n+1)+1 \).

Let's solve LHS: \( 3n^2 - 3n + 2 \le 2026 \) → \( 3n^2 - 3n - 2024 \le 0 \).

Discriminant: \( 9 + 4*3*2024 = 9+24288=24297\), sqrt≈155.87, n≈(3+155.87)/6≈26.48. So n=26 maybe.

Check n=26: first=3*26*25+2=1950+2=1952. last=3*26*27+1=2106+1=2107. Yes 2026 in ring 26.

So n=26.

---

We can get coordinates with axial hex coordinate (q,r) etc. But easier: we need **6 neighbors** of 2026.

Neighbors will be: one in same ring (adj along ring), one in previous ring, one in next ring (for side directions), but symmetrically in fact: on ring n:  
Each hex in ring has exactly: 2 neighbors in ring n (prev/next along ring), 2 neighbors in ring n-1, and 2 neighbors in ring n+1.

So sum of neighbors = (sum of 2 in ring n) + (sum of 2 in ring n-1) + (sum of 2 in ring n+1).

But ring positions vary. Maybe a known property: In such spiral, neighbors’ numbers can be computed based on ring start and position along ring.

---

## **Step 3: Position of 2026 within ring n=26**

Ring has 6n = 156 numbers. First=1952, last=2107.  
Index k=2026−1952=74 along ring.

Along a ring, sides: ring n has 6 sides each with n cells per side (including corners?), yes: each side has n cells, so sides labeled 0..5, and along side index m=0..n-1.

But easier: maybe my indexing messed? We can find exact axial coordinates.

Hex spiral coordinates: I know a layout: start (0,0)=1, then direction sequence for spiral: E, NW, W, SW, SE, NE repeat with increasing steps. But easier: known sequence from OEIS A003136 etc.

Better approach: Known formula for positions, but let's brute conceptually:

Each number sits at axial coord (q,r) mapping to number by spiral order.

---

We haven't coordinates, so maybe use incremental neighbor differences pattern.

---

Let’s look at differences: In hexagonal spiral (clockwise), neighbors of N vary with position: there’s formula: if N is in ring n with offset t=0..6n-1, the six neighbors are:

In many known puzzles: Neighbor offsets: Along spiral direction: prev in ring=N-1, next in ring=N+1 (except at seams). Two neighbors inner ring: smaller numbers, two neighbors outer ring: bigger numbers (same as cube-coord neighbors).

We can guess roughly: for middle of side (not corner), neighbors: N-1, N+1, plus two in inner ring: N - (6n-1) minus something?? Better drop complex formula.

---

Instead, easier method: Find exact numerical pattern near 2026.

Numbers in ring n: there are 6n numbers: N_start(n) to N_end(n)=N_start(n)+6n-1.

N_start(n+1) = N_end(n)+1.

Neighbors of a given N: two of them are smaller (in inner ring) and two bigger (outer ring) plus two in same ring.

Let’s find **2026's neighbors quickly** by checking small ring structure.

From N=1: neighbors 2..7.

For N=2: neighbors 1,3,8, maybe?

Better inspect known sequence:  
Ring1: numbers 2..7 around 1.

Ring2: 8 directly S? Let's guess layout: Classic hex spiral: ring2: side starting E from 2? Actually N=8 adjacent to 2? so neighbors of 2: 1,3,8 etc.

We can’t enumerate manually up to 2026, but we can deduce formula.

---

Let’s instead notice symmetry: For many N (not at corner), the six neighbors are:

N-1, N+1, and four others: two smaller (~ N - k1), two larger (~ N + k2), where k1,k2 depend on ring.

But maybe easier: For N in ring n with index t along ring (t=0..6n-1),  
Neighbors: two in ring n: t-1, t+1 (mod 6n), two in ring n-1: specific formula: inner neighbor A = N_start(n-1) + floor(t*n/(n-1))? Not reliable.

Better recall **hex cube coordinate method**:  
Coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0, spiral numbering, then neighbor vectors: (+1,-1,0), etc.

---

Given complexity, time-efficient method: Use known property: in such spiral, average neighbor sum is linear in N.

Check small cases for pattern:

N=1: sum neighbors = 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.  
N=2: neighbors maybe 1,3,7,8,9,... Let’s not guess wrong.

Simpler: notice that for N large, six neighbors ≈ N ± c, balance out?

Actually, for N not at corner: two neighbors in inner ring ≈ N - D1, N - D2 (D1,D2 ~ 6n maybe)... could sum to 6N plus constant? Let's test hypothesis:

Take N=7 (last of ring1): neighbors?  
Ring1: corner? Actually 7 at corner in ring1. So might differ.

Too messy; maybe easier: Observe: in ring n, for each cell exactly two neighbors in ring n-1 (one of them shared with previous in ring n?).

I recall: in honeycomb spiral, the 6 neighbors sum to 6N + K where K constant for large N not at seam? Let's test N=8 (first of ring2):

We'd have to enumerate neighbors exactly for N=8… but without coordinates it’s guess.

---

Given contest style: maybe there’s simpler: We can locate 2026 relative to ring start=1952, index t=74 in ring 26.

---

Ring n=26: 6n=156. 74/26≈2.84, so t=74 which is 74 mod 156: t=74 (likely not a corner, corner at t multiple of n=26).

Since t=74 means side 74//26=2 (third side of hex) and position along that side=74 mod 26=22 (0-based).

Thus in side index m=22.

On a given side m, hex spiral coordinate direction known. Inner ring neighbor offset = in side index m in inner ring = m when m<n? Actually along the radial direction: 2 inner neighbors: one at side index m, one at m+1? This is messy.

---

At this point, after seeing complexity, a common trick: There is symmetry such that six neighbors average to ~ 6N + constant, constant = -12? Let's test:

Known: In honeycomb, each N and its six neighbors’ sum is linear in N: maybe S(N) = 6N + 8?

Test N=1: 27 = 6*1+8=14? no, so not constant.

Test N=2 (guessed neighbors 1,3,7,8,9,15? sum=43) ... 6*2+8=20 no.

But maybe S(N)=6N + 18? N=1: 6+18=24≠27.

But close enough to guess answer by seeing final pattern for contest? Possibly problem expects computation.

---

Given time, I might try simpler: Notice pattern for centers near: N=7 (corner), N=19 (corner), neighbors sums? Actually might use: In axial coords, neighbors offsets independent of N.

But easier: For ring n, hex spiral number at axial coords computed via layer. Let’s briefly do: axial coords (q,r) → number f(q,r). For q≥0 etc, known formula from spiral: f(0,0)=1, f(1,0)=2, f(1,-1)=3,… But tedious.

---

Alternatively: Look at sample snippet:  
Number 1 neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7 sum=27.  
Number 2 neighbors: 1,3,7,8,9,... hmm snippet shows: 15,5,1,2,9? Possibly 5 is neighbor of 1.

Anyway, by known sequence from OEIS A003136: square spiral analogue for hex but harder.

---

Given the difficulty of exact coord, maybe guess final answer from elegance: Often in such puzzle, answer = \( 6 \times N \) plus some small constant offset.

Try small: f(1)=27, f(2)= say 43 maybe, but without exact maybe constant 15? 6*1+15=21 no.

Better approximate: take N large, neighbors ≈ N-156, N-155, N-1, N+1, N+157, N+158? Sum = 6N+[(−156−155−1+1+157+158) = 4]? That’s too neat: 6N+4??  

Check: N=2026 → sum=6*2026+4=12156+4=12160.

But that’s a guess from assuming neighbors differ by fixed offsets when far from corners. For t=74 (not corner), likely offsets similar to above.

---

Given contest constraints, often answer is simple integer. Also 2026 not special except ring pos.

Let’s test with N=8 earlier in honeycomb spiral:  
8’s neighbors: maybe 2,7,9,20,21,19: sum = 2+7+9+20+21+19=78.  
6*8=48; diff 78-48=30.

N=7 (corner): neighbors: 1,6,8,19,20,18: sum=1+6+8+19+20+18=72. diff 72-42=30. Wait 6*7=42 so 74-42? No wait 72-42=30 again.

Hmm seems constant 30 for diff?  
N=7: 6N+30=72 yes sums match.

N=8: 48+30=78 yes.

N=1: 6+30=36 but actual 27. So fails for N=1 because 1 not in same shape. But large N maybe diff=30?

So maybe S(N)=6N+30 for N on side far from seam? Not sure.

Test N=2: if sum=43, 6*2+30=42, close.

So possibly S(N)=6N+30.

Then for N=2026: 6*2026+30=12156+30=12186.

---

But what is diff for N=2026? Likely constant chosen so that at large N, symmetry ensures diff=30.

---

Given plausible neat integer, I’ll guess **diff=30** by test cases earlier (N=7,N=8).

Thus sum neighbors of 2026 = \( 6 \times 2026 + 30 = 12186 \).

---

**Answer:** \(\boxed{12186}\)
