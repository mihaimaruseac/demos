Reason:
- In the standard hex spiral (1 at center, 2 to the right, then counterclockwise), write n on ring k (k≥1) with 6k numbers per ring. Let N_k = 3k(k+1)+1 be the last number on ring k and A_k = N_{k-1}+1 the first.
- For a number n on ring k, side s (0..5), interior position p (1 ≤ p ≤ k−2), its six neighbors are:
  n−1, n+1,
  n−(6k+s−6), n−(6k+s−5),
  n+(6k+s), n+(6k+s+1).
  Their sum simplifies to 6n + 12, independent of k, s, p.
- Find k for n=2026: N_25=1951 < 2026 ≤ N_26=2107, so k=26. The offset t = n−A_26 = 2026−(N_25+1) = 2026−1952 = 74, so side s=floor(74/26)=2 and position p=74 mod 26=22, which is interior (1..24).
- Therefore, sum of the six neighbors = 6n + 12 = 6*2026 + 12 = 12168.
