Sketch:
- Max number on ring r is M(r) = 3r(r−1)+1. For 2026, M(26)=1951 < 2026 ≤ M(27)=2107, so 2026 is on ring r=27.
- Ring-27 corners (ascending) are: 1977, 2003, 2029, 2055, 2081, 2107. So 2026 is on the side between 2003 and 2029, with offset t = 2026 − 2003 = 23.
- Neighbors:
  - Same ring: 2025, 2027.
  - Inner ring (r−1=26), its second corner is B2 = M(26) − 4·25 = 1951 − 100 = 1851, giving inner neighbors 1851+(t−1)=1873 and 1851+t=1874.
  - Outer ring (r+1=28), its second corner is C2 = M(28) − 4·27 = 2269 − 108 = 2161, giving outer neighbors 2161+t=2184 and 2161+t+1=2185.
- Sum = 2025+2027+1873+1874+2184+2185 = 12168.
