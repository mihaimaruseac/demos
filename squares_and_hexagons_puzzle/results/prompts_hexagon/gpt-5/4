Sketch of reasoning:
- In this hex spiral, ring r has max M(r)=3r(r+1)+1. For n=2026, M(25)=1951 < 2026 ≤ M(26)=2107, so n is on ring r=26.
- Let t = n − (M(25)+1) = 74. On ring r, index the 6 sides s=0..5 with lengths [r, r, r, r, r, r] except the first side has r nodes starting at the ring’s start. Then s = floor(t/r) = 2 (the W side), and the step on that side is i = t − s·r + 1 = 23.
- Using axial coords with directions E(1,0), NE(1,−1), NW(0,−1), W(−1,0), SW(−1,1), SE(0,1), the coordinate of 2026 is on the W side: C1 + i·W = (26,−26) + 23·(−1,0) = (3,−26).
- Its 6 neighbors’ coordinates are:
  (4,−26), (4,−27), (3,−27), (2,−26), (2,−25), (3,−25),
  which map to labels 2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874, 1873 respectively.
- Sum = (2025+2027) + (2184+2185) + (1873+1874) = 4052 + 4369 + 3747 = 12168.
