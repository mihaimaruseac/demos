Sketch:
- The spiral is by hexagonal rings. Ring r ends at L(r) = 1 + 3r(r+1) and starts at F(r) = L(r−1)+1 = 3r(r−1)+2.
- 2026 lies in ring r with L(r−1) < 2026 ≤ L(r). Since L(25)=1951 and L(26)=2107, we have r=26 and F(26)=1952.
- Within ring 26, the index p = 2026−1952 = 74. Each side has length r, so side s = ⌊74/26⌋ = 2, and offset t = (74 mod 26)+1 = 23. This is an interior point of side s=2 (NE→NW).
- For an interior point (1 < t < r) on side s:
  - Same-ring neighbors: n−1, n+1.
  - Inner-ring neighbors (ring r−1): F(r−1) + s(r−1) + (t−2), and F(r−1) + s(r−1) + (t−1).
  - Outer-ring neighbors (ring r+1): F(r+1) + s(r+1) + (t−1), and F(r+1) + s(r+1) + t.

Compute:
- F(25)=3·25·24+2=1802; F(27)=3·27·26+2=2108; s=2; t=23.
- Inner: 1802 + 2·25 + 21 = 1873; and 1802 + 50 + 22 = 1874.
- Outer: 2108 + 2·27 + 22 = 2184; and 2108 + 54 + 23 = 2185.
- Same-ring: 2025, 2027.

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168.
