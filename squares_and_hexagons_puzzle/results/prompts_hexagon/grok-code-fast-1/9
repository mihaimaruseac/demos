The natural numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid in a spiral starting from 1 at the center. The number 2026 is located at position (-23, 23) in ring 26.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are at positions (-22, 23), (-23, 24), (-24, 24), (-24, 23), (-23, 22), and (-22, 22).

The sum of the numbers at these positions is 6 × 2026 + 36 = 12156 + 36 = 12192.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{12192} \]
