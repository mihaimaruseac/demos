The natural numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid spiral starting from 1 at the center. The number 2026 is in layer 26, which has 156 cells. The sum of its 6 neighbors is calculated based on the pattern observed in smaller layers, extrapolated to layer 26.

The sum is 6 × 2026 + 12 × 26 = 12468.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{12468} \]
