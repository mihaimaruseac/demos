The natural numbers are arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, with 2026 in ring 26. The six neighbors of 2026 are the two adjacent numbers in ring 26 (2025 and 2027), the inner neighbor in ring 25 (1874), and the three outer neighbors in ring 27 (2157, 2184, and 2211).

The sum of these neighbors is 2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2157 + 2184 + 2211 = 12478.
