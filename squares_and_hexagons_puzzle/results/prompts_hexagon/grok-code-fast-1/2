The natural numbers are placed on a hexagonal grid in a spiral starting from 1 at the center. The number 2026 is in ring 26.

In such spirals, the sum of the 6 neighbors of a number n in ring k is 6n + 6k(k+1).

For n=2026, k=26, the sum is 6 × 2026 + 6 × 26 × 27 = 12156 + 4212 = 16368.

The answer is: 16368
