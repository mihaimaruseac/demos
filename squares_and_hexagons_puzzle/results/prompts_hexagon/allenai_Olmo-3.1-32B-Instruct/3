Let me solve this step by step.

We have a hexagonal spiral that starts at the center with 1, and numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral. The sample shows:

     14  4  3 10
     15  5  1  2  9
     16  6  7  8

From this, we can deduce the coordinate system and the pattern of the spiral.

### Step 1: Understanding the spiral layout

Let’s assign coordinates to the numbers, with (0,0) at the center (number 1).

Let’s try to assign coordinates to the sample:

Let’s use axial coordinates (q, r) for hex grids.

Let’s place 1 at (0,0).

Looking at the sample, let’s try to reconstruct the positions of numbers 1 through 10.

Let’s suppose the spiral moves in steps of increasing length. In a hex grid, a common spiral is:

- Start at (0,0) with 1
- Move right (q+1) for 1 step: 2 at (1,0)
- Move up-right (r+1) for 1 step: 3 at (1,1)
- Move up-left (q-1) for 2 steps: 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1)
- Move left (q-1) for 2 steps: 6 at (-2,1), 7 at (-2,0)
- Move down-left (r-1) for 2 steps: 8 at (-2,-1), 9 at (-1,-1)
- Move down-right (q+1) for 3 steps: 10 at (0,-1), 11 at (1,-1), 12 at (2,-1)
But this doesn't match the sample. Let's try to reverse-engineer from the sample.

Let’s write out the sample with coordinates.

Let’s suppose:

Let’s say (0,0) = 1

Let’s see where 2 is. In the sample, 1 is surrounded by 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and possibly others.

From the sample:

Row 1: 14  4  3 10
Row 2: 15  5  1  2  9
Row 3: 16  6  7  8

Let’s try to arrange these in a grid.

Let’s assign coordinates (x, y), with y increasing upwards.

Let’s try:

Let’s put 1 at (0,0).

To its right is 2 at (1,0).
Above 1 is 5 at (0,1).
Above 5 is 4 at (-1,1).
Left of 4 is 14 at (-2,1).
Right of 4 is 3 at (0,1)? Wait, that's 5's spot.

Alternatively, let's try to assign coordinates by hand:

Let’s label positions around 1:

Let’s say the six neighbors of (0,0) are at:

- (1,0) : east
- (0,1) : northeast
- (-1,1) : northwest
- (-1,0) : west
- (0,-1) : southwest
- (1,-1) : southeast

Let’s check the sample:

From the sample, 1 is at center.

Let’s look at the numbers around 1 in the sample:

Row above 1: 15 5
Row left of 1: 14 4 3
Row right of 1: 2 9
Row below 1: 16 6 7 8

But the sample is not perfectly symmetric in the text, but let's try to reconstruct.

Alternatively, let's look up the known "hexagonal number spiral".

But since this is an original puzzle, let's deduce from the pattern.

Let’s list the numbers and try to map them.

Let’s try to build the spiral step by step.

Let’s use axial coordinates (q, r), and let’s define the 6 neighbors as:

- (q+1, r)
- (q, r+1)
- (q-1, r+1)
- (q-1, r)
- (q, r-1)
- (q+1, r-1)

Let’s start at (0,0) = 1

Let’s spiral outward in layers. Each layer is a "ring" around the center.

Layer 0: (0,0) = 1

Layer 1: moves to the 6 neighbors of (0,0)

Let’s define the direction order as:

1. East: (q+1, r)
2. Northeast: (q, r+1)
3. Northwest: (q-1, r+1)
4. West: (q-1, r)
5. Southwest: (q, r-1)
6. Southeast: (q+1, r-1)

But usually in hexagonal spirals, the movement is:

- Right (east)
- Up-right (northeast)
- Up-left (northwest)
- Left (west)
- Down-left (southwest)
- Down-right (southeast)

But the number of steps per direction increases every two turns.

Let’s try to build the spiral step by step, keeping track of the coordinates and numbers.

Let’s define the movement sequence:

- Move east 1 step
- Move northeast 1 step
- Move northwest 2 steps
- Move west 2 steps
- Move southwest 2 steps
- Move southeast 3 steps
- Move east 3 steps
- Move northeast 3 steps
- etc.

But let's see if we can fit the sample.

Alternatively, let’s use a known mapping for hexagonal number spirals.

But since we have a concrete sample, let’s try to reconstruct.

Let’s try to assign coordinates to the sample numbers.

Let’s arrange the sample as follows (assuming each entry is a cell in a hex grid):

Let’s make a coordinate grid.

Let’s try to assign (row, col):

Let’s say the center (1) is at (0,0).

Let’s try:

(0,0): 1

Let’s look at the row: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
Above that: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
And below: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Let’s try to lay out as follows (using axial coordinates):

Let’s suppose (0,0) = 1

To the east (right): (1,0) = 2

To the northeast (up-right): (0,1) = 5

To the northwest (up-left): (-1,1) = 4

To the west (left): (-1,0) = 15

To the southwest (down-left): (0,-1) = 6

To the southeast (down-right): (1,-1) = 7

But in the sample, 6 is below 1, so perhaps (0,-1) = 6

Let’s check the sample:

Row above 1: 15 5
Row left of 1: 14 4 3
Row right of 1: 2 9
Row below 1: 16 6 7 8

Let’s try to map as:

Let’s use (x, y), y increasing upwards.

Let’s center 1 at (0,0).

Let’s fill the positions around it:

Let’s define the six neighbors of (0,0):

Let’s define the neighbors as:

- (1,0): east
- (0,1): northeast
- (-1,1): northwest
- (-1,0): west
- (0,-1): southwest
- (1,-1): southeast

Now let’s fill in the numbers from the sample.

From the sample:

Row with 14 4 3 10 is above the row with 15 5 1 2 9

Let’s suppose:

Let’s say the row with 15 5 1 2 9 is y=0

So:

x = -2: 15
x = -1: 5
x = 0: 1
x = 1: 2
x = 2: 9

Row above (y=1):

x = -3: 14
x = -2: 4
x = -1: 3
x = 0: 10
x = 1: ?

Row below (y=-1):

x = -3: 16
x = -2: 6
x = -1: 7
x = 0: 8

Now let’s assign coordinates (x, y):

( -2, 0 ) = 15
( -1, 0 ) = 5
( 0, 0 ) = 1
( 1, 0 ) = 2
( 2, 0 ) = 9

( -3, 1 ) = 14
( -2, 1 ) = 4
( -1, 1 ) = 3
( 0, 1 ) = 10

( -3, -1 ) = 16
( -2, -1 ) = 6
( -1, -1 ) = 7
( 0, -1 ) = 8

Now let’s see which coordinates correspond to which neighbors.

Let’s check neighbors of (0,0):

Neighbors are:

(1,0) = 2
(0,1) = 10
(-1,1) = 3
(-1,0) = 5
(0,-1) = 8
(1,-1) = ? (not in this grid yet)

Wait, (1,-1) is not in the above, but let's suppose it would be just to the right and below (0,-1), which would be (2,-1). Let's check if we have that value.

From the spiral, after 8, the next numbers would be 11, 12, etc.

But in the sample, we only have up to 16.

But let's check the neighbors:

(0,0) = 1

Neighbors:

- (1,0) = 2
- (0,1) = 10
- (-1,1) = 3
- (-1,0) = 5
- (0,-1) = 8
- (1,-1) = ?

But in our mapping, (1,-1) is not yet assigned. But (2,-1) might be the next cell in that direction.

But let's check the actual sample:

From the arrangement:

Let’s try to see if this coordinate system matches the spiral order.

Let’s try to assign numbers in order and see if we can match the sample.

Let’s try to build the spiral step by step:

Let’s define movement directions in order:

1. East (right): (q+1, r)
2. Northeast (up-right): (q, r+1)
3. Northwest (up-left): (q-1, r+1)
4. West (left): (q-1, r)
5. Southwest (down-left): (q, r-1)
6. Southeast (down-right): (q+1, r-1)

And the number of steps in each direction increases every two turns.

Let’s define the step sequence:

- East: 1
- Northeast: 1
- Northwest: 2
- West: 2
- Southwest: 2
- Southeast: 3
- East: 3
- Northeast: 3
- etc.

Let’s start at (0,0) = 1

Now, let's lay out the steps:

1. Start at (0,0) = 1

2. East 1: (1,0) = 2

3. Northeast 1: (1,1) = 3

4. Northwest 2 steps:
   - (0,1) = 4
   - (-1,1) = 5

5. West 2 steps:
   - (-2,1) = 6
   - (-3,1) = 7

But in the sample, 15 is above 5, and 14 is above 15.

Wait, let's try a different direction order.

Alternatively, perhaps the spiral is:

- Start at (0,0) = 1
- Move right (east) to (1,0) = 2
- Move up-right (northeast) to (1,1) = 3
- Move up-left (northwest) to (0,1) = 4, then (-1,1) = 5
- Move left (west) to (-2,1) = 6, (-3,1) = 7
- Move down-left (southwest) to (-3,0) = 8, (-3,-1) = 9
- Move down-right (southeast) to (-2,-1) = 10, (-1,-1) = 11, (0,-1) = 12
But this does not match the sample.

Alternatively, let's try to match the sample explicitly.

From the sample:

Row y=1: 14  4  3 10
Row y=0: 15  5  1  2  9
Row y=-1: 16  6  7  8

Let’s assign coordinates as (x, y), with (0,0) = 1

From the row y=0:
x=-2: 15
x=-1: 5
x=0: 1
x=1: 2
x=2: 9

From y=1:
x=-3: 14
x=-2: 4
x=-1: 3
x=0: 10

From y=-1:
x=-3: 16
x=-2: 6
x=-1: 7
x=0: 8

Now, let's check the neighbors of 1 at (0,0):

The six neighbors are:

(1,0) = 2
(-1,0) = 5
(0,1) = 10
(0,-1) = 8
(1,-1) = ? (not in the grid yet)
(-1,1) = 3

From above, (0,1) = 10, (0,-1) = 8, (1,0) = 2, (-1,0) = 5, (-1,1) = 3

What about (1,-1)? That would be x=1, y=-1. In the y=-1 row, x=1 is not shown, but x=-3 to 0 are shown.

But in the y=-1 row: x=-3:16, x=-2:6, x=-1:7, x=0:8

So (1,-1) is not shown. Let's assume the grid is not fully shown.

But for now, let's note the neighbors of 1:

- (1,0) = 2
- (-1,0) = 5
- (0,1) = 10
- (0,-1) = 8
- (-1,1) = 3
- (1,-1) = ? (unknown, let's call it X)

But in the sample, the number above 5 is 15 at (-2,0), but that's not a neighbor of 1.

Now, let's check the arrangement: is this a standard hex grid coordinate system?

Let’s check if the neighbors of 1 are as above:

From (0,0), the six neighbors should be:

(q+1, r) = (1,0) = 2
(q, r+1) = (0,1) = 10
(q-1, r+1) = (-1,1) = 3
(q-1, r) = (-1,0) = 5
(q, r-1) = (0,-1) = 8
(q+1, r-1) = (1,-1) = ?

So the only missing neighbor is (1,-1), which is not shown in the sample.

But in the y=-1 row, x=1 is not shown, so perhaps it's outside the shown grid.

But let's try to fill in the spiral order to see what number is at (1,-1).

Let’s reconstruct the spiral up to at least 16, and see the numbering.

Let’s try to assign numbers in order and see where they land.

Let’s define the movement as follows (this is a common hex spiral):

Let’s define directions in order (clockwise starting from east):

1. East (q+1, r)
2. Southeast (q, r-1)
3. Southwest (q-1, r-1)
4. West (q-1, r)
5. Northwest (q, r+1)
6. Northeast (q+1, r+1)

But in the sample, the numbers seem to go:

1 at center

Then 2 to the right

Then 3 above-right

Then 4 above-left

Then 5 further above-left

Then 6 above-left and down?

But let's try another approach: let's list the numbers in the order they appear in the sample and see their positions.

Let’s try to assign numbers to coordinates in the order they appear in a spiral.

Let’s start at (0,0) = 1

Let’s move right (east) to (1,0) = 2

Now, let’s move up-right (northeast) to (1,1) = 3

Then up-left (northwest) to (0,1) = 4, then (-1,1) = 5

Then left (west) to (-2,1) = 6, then (-3,1) = 7

But in the sample, 15 is above 5, so perhaps after 5 we move up? But (-2,1) would be above 5 if y increases upwards.

Wait, perhaps my y-axis is inverted.

Let’s define y increasing upwards.

So, let's reassign:

Let’s say y increases upwards.

So the sample is:

Row y=2: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
Row y=1: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
Row y=0: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

So (0,1) = 1

Let’s fill:

From the sample:

At y=1: x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

At y=2: x=-3:14, x=-2:4, x=-1:3, x=0:10

At y=0: x=-3:16, x=-2:6, x=-1:7, x=0:8

Now, let’s check neighbors of 1 at (0,1):

Neighbors are:

(q+1, r) = (1,1) = 3
(q, r+1) = (0,2) = ? (not shown)
(q-1, r+1) = (-1,2) = ? (not shown)
(q-1, r) = (-1,1) = 5
(q, r-1) = (0,0) = 9
(q+1, r-1) = (1,0) = 2

Wait, but in the sample, (0,0) is 9? But in the sample, (0,1) is 1, and below it is (0,0), which is 9.

But in the sample's y=0 row, x=0 is 8, x=-1 is 7, x=-2 is 6, x=-3 is 16.

But in the y=1 row, x=0 is 1, x=1 is 2, x=-1 is 5, x=-2 is 15

y=2 row: x=-3:14, x=-2:4, x=-1:3, x=0:10

So (0,2) = 10

(-1,2) = 3

(-2,2) = 4

(-3,2) = 14

Now, neighbors of (0,1):

(q+1, r) = (1,1) = ? (not shown)
(q, r+1) = (0,2) = 10
(q-1, r+1) = (-1,2) = 3
(q-1, r) = (-1,1) = 5
(q, r-1) = (0,0) = 9
(q+1, r-1) = (1,0) = 2

But in the sample, (1,1) is not shown, but (1,0) = 2, (0,0) = 9

But according to the sample, (0,0) = 9

But previously we thought (0,0) = 1, but according to this arrangement, (0,1) = 1, (0,0) = 9

So let's redefine:

Let (x, y), y increases upwards.

Let’s set (0,1) = 1

Then (1,1) = 3
(-1,1) = 5
(-2,1) = 15
(0,0) = 9
(1,0) = 2
(-1,0) = ? (not shown)
(0,-1) = 8
(-1,-1) = 7
(-2,-1) = 6
(-3,-1) = 16

But in the sample, at y=0, x=0 is 8, x=-1 is 7, x=-2 is 6, x=-3 is 16

So (0,0) = 8

But above that is (0,1) = 1

So (0,1) = 1, (0,0) = 8

But in the sample, the 1 is surrounded by 5, 2, 9, etc.

Let’s check the neighbors of (0,1):

(q+1, r) = (1,1) = 3
(q, r+1) = (0,2) = 10
(q-1, r+1) = (-1,2) = 4
(q-1, r) = (-1,1) = 5
(q, r-1) = (0,0) = 8
(q+1, r-1) = (1,0) = 2

So the six neighbors of 1 at (0,1) are: 3, 10, 4, 5, 8, 2

But in the sample, around 1 are 5 (left), 2 (right), 9 (below), and above it is 10, and to the upper left and upper right are 4 and 3.

But (0,0) = 8, but in the sample below 1 is 9.

Wait, there's a mismatch.

Let’s check the sample again:

The row with 1 is: 15 5 1 2 9

So left of 1 is 5, right is 2, below is 9.

But in our coordinate mapping, below is (0,0) = 8, but in the sample it's 9.

So perhaps (0,0) = 9

Let’s try (0,1) = 1

Then (0,0) = 9 (below)
(1,1) = 3 (right-up)
(-1,1) = 5 (left-up)
(1,0) = 2 (right)
(-1,0) = ? (left)
(0,-1) = ? (below-center)

But in the sample, below 1 is 9, so (0,0) = 9

To the right of 1 is 2 at (1,0)

To the left of 1 is ? at (-1,0), not shown

Above 1 is ? at (0,2)

Above right of 1 is 3 at (1,1)

Above left of 1 is 5 at (-1,1)

Below center of 1 is 9 at (0,0)

But in the sample, to the right of 9 is nothing shown, but to the left is not shown.

But in the row below, at y=0: ... 16 6 7 8

But at x=0, y=0 is 9 according to the sample row: 15 5 1 2 9

So (0,0) = 9

Then to the left at (-1,0) is not shown

To the right at (1,0) is 2

Above at (0,1) = 1

Below at (0,-1) = ? (not shown in the sample)

Left-up at (-1,1) = 5

Right-up at (1,1) = 3

Now, let's try to build the spiral from 1 outward.

Let’s define the spiral order.

Let’s suppose the spiral proceeds as follows, starting at (0,1) = 1

But it's easier to start at the center.

Alternatively, let's accept the coordinate mapping as per the sample and try to deduce the neighbor pattern.

From the sample, the six neighbors of 1 at (0,1) are:

- Above: (0,2) = 10
- Above right: (1,2) = ? (not shown, but in y=2 row, x=0 is 10, x=-1 is 3, x=-2 is 4, x=-3 is 14)
But (1,2) is not shown.
But (1,1) = 3
- Above left: (-1,2) = 4
- Left: (-1,1) = 5
- Right: (1,1) = 3
- Below: (0,0) = 9

But that's only 5 distinct neighbors shown, missing one.

Alternatively, perhaps the six neighbors are:

- (1,1) = 3
- (0,2) = 10
- (-1,2) = 4
- (-1,1) = 5
- (0,0) = 9
- (1,0) = 2

That matches all six.

So the neighbors of 1 are: 3, 10, 4, 5, 9, 2

But in the sample, below 1 is 9, left is 5, right is 2, above is 10, above left is 4, above right is 3.

So this mapping is consistent.

Therefore, the coordinate system is:

Let (x, y), y increases upwards.

(0,1) = 1

Neighbors:
(1,1) = 3
(0,2) = 10
(-1,2) = 4
(-1,1) = 5
(0,0) = 9
(1,0) = 2

Now, let's generalize the spiral to find the coordinates for larger numbers, specifically for 2026, and then find its six neighbors and their sum.

But first, let's find a formula or a pattern to map number n to coordinates (x, y).

Alternatively, let's try to find a pattern in the numbering.

Let’s try to list the numbers in order with their coordinates, at least for the outer layers.

Let’s try to reconstruct the spiral up to at least number 16.

Let’s start at (0,1) = 1

Let’s define the movement as follows (let’s try to match the sample):

Let’s suppose the spiral proceeds by layers. Let’s define the layers by the maximum of |x| and |y - 1|.

But perhaps easier to list the numbers in the order they are placed.

Let’s try to trace the path:

Let’s start at (0,1) = 1

Let’s move right (east) to (1,1) = 2

But in the sample, to the right of 1 is 2 at (1,0)? Wait, in the sample, 1 at (0,1), 2 at (1,1)? But in the sample, 2 is at (1,0).

From earlier, we mapped (1,0) = 2

But let's be precise.

From the sample mapping:

Let’s define:

(0,1) = 1

(1,1) = 3

(-1,1) = 5

(-2,1) = 15

(-3,1) = 14

(-3,0) = 16

(-3,-1) = ? (not shown)

But let's try to trace the path step by step.

Let’s try the following movement pattern (this is a standard hexagonal spiral):

Let’s define directions in order (clockwise):

1. East (x+1, y)
2. Southeast (x, y-1)
3. Southwest (x-1, y-1)
4. West (x-1, y)
5. Northwest (x, y+1)
6. Northeast (x+1, y+1)

But let’s try another way.

Alternatively, let's observe the numbers in the sample and see the sequence.

Let’s list the numbers in reading order (left to right, top to bottom):

Top row (y=2): 14, 4, 3, 10

Next row (y=1): 15, 5, 1, 2, 9

Next row (y=0): 16, 6, 7, 8

Let’s assign coordinates as per above:

y=2: x=-3:14, x=-2:4, x=-1:3, x=0:10

y=1: x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

y=0: x=-3:16, x=-2:6, x=-1:7, x=0:8

Let’s try to assign numbers in spiral order starting from 1.

Let’s start at (0,1) = 1

Let’s try to move in a spiral:

Let’s say we start by moving left to ( -1,1 ) = 5

But in the sample, left of 1 is 5

Then up-left to ( -2,1 ) = 15

Then up to ( -3,1 ) = 14

Then right to ( -2,0 ) = 16

But in the sample, below 15 is 16 at ( -2,0 )

But let's try to define the steps:

Let’s try this spiral order:

Start at (0,1) = 1

1. Move left: ( -1,1 ) = 5
2. Move left: ( -2,1 ) = 15
3. Move left: ( -3,1 ) = 14
4. Move down: ( -3,0 ) = 16
5. Move right: ( -2,0 ) = 6
6. Move right: ( -1,0 ) = 7
7. Move right: ( 0,0 ) = 8
8. Move right: ( 1,0 ) = 2
9. Move up: ( 1,1 ) = 3
10. Move right: ( 2,1 ) = ? (not in sample)
But in the sample, to the right of 3 is 10 at (0,2)? No, at (0,2) is 10

Alternatively, after 2 at (1,0), move up to (1,1) = 3

Then up to (1,2) = ? (not in sample)

But in the sample, above 3 is nothing shown, but at (0,2) is 10

Alternatively, after (1,0) = 2, move up to (1,1) = 3

Then move left-up to (0,2) = 10

Then left-up to (-1,2) = 4

Then left to (-2,2) = ?

But in the sample, at y=2, x=-2 is 4

So (-2,2) = 4

Then (-3,2) = 14

But let's try to number the cells in order.

Let’s try to list the path:

Let’s start at (0,1) = 1

Let’s move left to (-1,1) = 5

Then left to (-2,1) = 15

Then left to (-3,1) = 14

Then down to (-3,0) = 16

Then right to (-2,0) = 6

Then right to (-1,0) = 7

Then right to (0,0) = 8

Then right to (1,0) = 2

Then up to (1,1) = 3

Then up to (1,2) = ? (not in sample, but let's say 11)

Then left to (0,2) = 10

Then left to (-1,2) = 4

Then left to (-2,2) = ? (but in sample it's 4 at (-2,2)? Wait, in sample y=2, x=-2 is 4

But we just came from (-1,2), so left to (-2,2) = 4

But we already had 4 at (-1,2)? No, let's keep track.

Let’s try to assign numbers in order as we go:

Let’s define a path:

Let’s try the following algorithm (similar to the "hexagonal number" spiral):

Let’s define layers. The center is layer 0.

Layer 1: the 6 cells around the center

Layer 2: the next ring, etc.

But let’s instead try to follow the sample’s path.

From the numbers in the sample, let's list their order of appearance as we spiral out from 1:

From 1, go left to 5 (step 2)
From 5, go left to 15 (step 3)
From 15, go left to 14 (step 4)
From 14, go down to 16 (step 5)
From 16, go right to 6 (step 6)
From 6, go right to 7 (step 7)
From 7, go right to 8 (step 8)
From 8, go right to 2 (step 9)
From 2, go up to 3 (step 10)
From 3, go up to ? (not shown)
But in the sample, above 3 is not shown, but at (0,2) is 10

Alternatively, after 2 at (1,0), go up to (1,1) = 3 (step 10)

Then up to (1,2) = 11 (not shown)

Then left to (0,2) = 10 (step 11)

Then left to (-1,2) = 4 (step 12)

Then left to (-2,2) = ? (but in the sample, at (-2,2) is 4, but we already used 4)

Wait, perhaps there's a misalignment.

Alternatively, let's number the cells in the order they are visited, starting from 1 at (0,1):

Let’s define a spiral that moves:

- Left 3 steps: ( -1,1 ), ( -2,1 ), ( -3,1 )
- Down 1 step: ( -3,0 )
- Right 4 steps: ( -2,0 ), ( -1,0 ), ( 0,0 ), ( 1,0 )
- Up 2 steps: ( 1,1 ), ( 1,2 )
- Left 3 steps: ( 0,2 ), ( -1,2 ), ( -2,2 )
- Down 1 step: ( -2,1 ) but already visited

But this doesn't match.

Alternatively, let's try to see the difference in indices.

Let’s observe the numbers and see if there's a formula for the coordinates based on the number.

Let’s list the coordinates for the numbers we know:

Let’s make a table:

Number | x | y
------ |---|---
14    | -3| 2
4     | -2| 2
3     | -1| 2
10    | 0 | 2
15    | -2| 1
5     | -1| 1
1     | 0 | 1
2     | 1 | 1
9     | 2 | 1
16    | -3| 0
6     | -2| 0
7     | -1| 0
8     | 0 | 0

Now, let's see if we can find a pattern.

Let’s observe that for a given "ring", the numbers increase as we move away from the center.

Let’s define the "ring" or "layer" as L = max(|x|, |y - 1|)

For example:

- (0,1): L = 0
- (1,1): L = 1
- (-2,1): L = 2
- (-3,2): L = 3
- (-3,0): L = 3

Let’s see how many numbers are in each layer.

Layer 0: (0,1) = 1 → 1 number

Layer 1: (1,1), (0,0), (-1,1), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)? But in our mapping, we have (1,1)=3, (0,0)=9, (-1,1)=5, (-2,1)=15

But let's list all positions at L=1:

|x| ≤ 1, |y-1| ≤ 1

So x = -1,0,1; y = 0,1,2

But in our mapping, only some are filled.

Alternatively, let's try to find a formula.

Let’s observe the numbers along the leftmost column (x=-3):

(-3,2) = 14

(-3,1) = 15

(-3,0) = 16

So as y decreases by 1, number increases by 1.

Similarly, along the bottom row (y=0):

(-3,0) = 16

(-2,0) = 6

(-1,0) = 7

(0,0) = 8

So from (-3,0) to (-2,0), number drops from 16 to 6

From (-2,0) to (-1,0): 6 to 7

From (-1,0) to (0,0): 7 to 8

So not a simple pattern.

Alternatively, let's try to find the side lengths.

Let’s see how the numbers increase on the outer edges.

Let’s try to see the maximum number in each layer.

Let’s see for L=0: max number = 1

L=1: includes up to 15

L=2: up to 16

But let's list the numbers on the "corners" of each layer.

Let’s try to define the starting number of each layer.

Let’s see the numbers at the "outermost" points:

Let’s try to see the sequence along the leftmost top:

(-3,2) = 14

(-2,2) = 4

(-1,2) = 3

(0,2) = 10

But that's not a straight line.

Alternatively, along the left edge from top to bottom:

(-3,2) = 14

(-3,1) = 15

(-3,0) = 16

So 14, 15, 16

Similarly, along the bottom from left to right:

(-3,0) = 16

(-2,0) = 6

(-1,0) = 7

(0,0) = 8

No clear pattern.

Alternatively, let's try to see the differences between numbers at similar positions.

Let’s try to find a general formula.

Let’s observe that in a hexagonal spiral, the numbers on the "rings" can be given by formulas involving hexagonal numbers.

The k-th hexagonal number is H_k = 3k(k-1) + 1

But let's see:

H_1 = 1

H_2 = 7

H_3 = 19

But in our spiral, the numbers don't match this exactly.

Alternatively, let's try to find the coordinates as a function of n.

Let’s try to find a pattern by continuing the spiral manually a bit further.

Let’s continue the spiral beyond 16, using the path suggested by the sample.

From the sample, after 16 at (-3,0), we have 6 at (-2,0), 7 at (-1,0), 8 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 10 at (0,2), 4 at (-1,2), 14 at (-3,2), 15 at (-2,1), 5 at (-1,1), 1 at (0,1)

Let’s try to continue from 16:

16 at (-3,0)

Next should be 17 at (-2,0)? But in the sample, (-2,0) = 6

Wait, in our earlier mapping, (-2,0) = 6

But 6 is much less than 16.

This suggests that the numbers are not filled in a simple outward spiral in the way we're mapping.

Given the confusion, perhaps we should use a known algorithm for the hexagonal spiral.

But since this is a custom spiral (as per the sample), let's deduce the neighbor offsets from the sample.

From the sample, the six neighbors of 1 at (0,1) are:

(1,1) = 3

(0,2) = 10

(-1,2) = 4

(-1,1) = 5

(0,0) = 9

(1,0) = 2

So the offsets from (0,1) are:

(1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

But in terms of (dx, dy):

From (0,1):

(1,1) = (0+1, 1+0) = (1,0) offset

Wait, (0,1) to (1,1) is (1,0)

(0,1) to (0,2) is (0,1)

(0,1) to (-1,2) is (-1,1)

(0,1) to (-1,1) is (-1,0)

(0,1) to (0,0) is (0,-1)

(0,1) to (1,0) is (1,-1)

So the six neighbor offsets are:

(1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

So in general, for a cell at (x, y), the six neighbors are:

(x+1, y)
(x, y+1)
(x-1, y+1)
(x-1, y)
(x, y-1)
(x+1, y-1)

Now, to find the number at a given coordinate, or vice versa, we need a formula.

Let’s try to find a pattern for the numbers at the coordinates.

Let’s list the numbers and coordinates we have:

Number | x | y
------ |---|---
14    | -3| 2
4     | -2| 2
3     | -1| 2
10    | 0 | 2
15    | -2| 1
5     | -1| 1
1     | 0 | 1
2     | 1 | 1
9     | 2 | 1
16    | -3| 0
6     | -2| 0
7     | -1| 0
8     | 0 | 0

Let’s try to see if there’s a relation between x, y, and n.

Let’s try to see for each "ring".

Let’s define ring k as all cells with max(|x|, |y-1|) = k

For k=0: (0,1) = 1

For k=1: |x| ≤ 1, |y-1| ≤ 1, and max(|x|,|y-1|)=1

So:

x= -1,0,1

y= 0,1,2

But only some are filled.

But in our mapping, the numbers at k=1 are:

(1,1)=3

(0,2)=10

(-1,2)=4

(-1,1)=5

(0,0)=9

(1,0)=2

But these are not in order.

Alternatively, let’s try to see the numbers on each "side" of the hexagon.

Let’s try to see the numbers along the left edge (x=-k, y from 1-k to 1+k):

For k=1:

x=-1, y=0,1,2

(-1,0)=7

(-1,1)=5

(-1,2)=4

Numbers: 7,5,4

For k=2:

x=-2, y= -1 to 3

But only y=0,1,2 shown

(-2,0)=6

(-2,1)=15

(-2,2)=4 (but 4 is at (-1,2)? No, at (-2,2) is not shown in the sample, at (-2,2) we don't have a value yet)

But in the sample, at y=2, x=-2 is 4

So (-2,2)=4

So for x=-2:

y=0:6

y=1:15

y=2:4

No obvious pattern.

Alternatively, let’s try to see if we can find a recurrence.

Let’s try to see the difference between numbers at similar positions in different layers.

For example, compare (0,1)=1 and (0,0)=9: difference of 8

Compare (1,1)=3 and (1,0)=2: difference of 1

Compare (-1,1)=5 and (-1,0)=7: difference of 2

Not helpful.

Alternatively, let’s see the numbers on the "outermost" ring.

Let’s list all numbers from 1 to 16 with their coordinates and see if we can find a pattern.

Let’s make a grid for y=0,1,2 and x=-3 to 2

y=2: x=-3:14, x=-2:4, x=-1:3, x=0:10

y=1: x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

y=0: x=-3:16, x=-2:6, x=-1:7, x=0:8

Now, let’s fill in the missing cells for completeness (assume spiral continues):

Let’s suppose the spiral continues by moving from 16 at (-3,0), then to (-2,0)=6, (-1,0)=7, (0,0)=8, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=11 (not shown), (0,2)=10, (-1,2)=4, (-2,2)=12 (not shown), (-3,2)=14, (-3,1)=15, (-2,1)=13 (not shown), (-1,1)=5, (0,1)=1

But let's try to continue from 16 at (-3,0):

After 16 at (-3,0), next is 17 at (-2,0)? But in the sample, (-2,0)=6

But 6 < 16, so the numbers are not increasing in that direction.

Given the confusion, perhaps the spiral is not numbered in the way we expect.

Alternatively, let's try to see if there's a pattern in the differences.

Let’s list the numbers in the order they might be visited in a spiral, starting from 1 at (0,1):

Let’s try this path:

Start at (0,1) = 1

Move left to (-1,1) = 5

Move left to (-2,1) = 15

Move left to (-3,1) = 14

Move down to (-3,0) = 16

Move right to (-2,0) = 6

Move right to (-1,0) = 7

Move right to (0,0) = 8

Move right to (1,0) = 2

Move up to (1,1) = 3

Move up to (1,2) = let's say 11

Move left to (0,2) = 10

Move left to (-1,2) = 4

Move left to (-2,2) = let's say 12

Move down to (-2,1) = already visited

But in the sample, (-2,1)=15, which was visited earlier.

Alternatively, after (-2,2), move down to (-2,1), but already visited.

Alternatively, after reaching (-2,2), we complete the ring and start the next.

But let's assign numbers in this order:

1: (0,1)

2: (-1,1)

3: (-2,1)

4: (-3,1)

5: (-3,0)

6: (-2,0)

7: (-1,0)

8: (0,0)

9: (1,0)

10: (1,1)

11: (1,2)

12: (0,2)

13: (-1,2)

14: (-2,2)

Now, let's compare to the sample:

From above:

(0,1) = 1

(-1,1) = 5 in sample, but here would be 2

But in the sample, (-1,1) = 5

So this does not match.

Alternatively, let's try a different starting direction.

Start at (0,1) = 1

Move right to (1,1) = 2

Move right to (2,1) = let's say 3

But in the sample, to the right of 1 is 2 at (1,0), not (1,1)

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should switch approaches.

Since the question is about the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026, and the spiral is regular, perhaps there is a formula for the sum of the neighbors of a number n in a hexagonal spiral.

In a standard hexagonal number spiral, the sum of the neighbors of n can often be expressed in terms of n and the layer it's on.

But in this spiral, the numbering is custom, but seems to be a variant of the hexagonal spiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is a linear function of n.

Let’s test with a small n.

From the sample, for n=1 at (0,1), the 6 neighbors are 3,10,4,5,9,2

Their sum is 3+10+4+5+9+2 = 33

Now, n=1, sum=33

Let’s try for n=2 at (1,0)

Neighbors of (1,0):

(2,0) = ? (not shown)

(1,1) = 3

(0,1) = 1

(0,0) = 9

(1,-1) = ? (not shown)

(2,-1) = ? (not shown)

But only some are shown.

But from the sample, we know (1,1)=3, (0,1)=1, (0,0)=9

Let’s suppose the spiral is symmetric and the missing neighbors are higher numbers.

But let's try n=9 at (2,1)

Neighbors of (2,1):

(3,1) = ?

(2,2) = ?

(1,2) = ?

(1,1) = 3

(2,0) = ?

(3,0) = ?

But only (1,1)=3 is known.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, let's try n=10 at (0,2)

Neighbors:

(1,2) = ?

(0,3) = ?

(-1,3) = ?

(-1,2) = 4

(0,1) = 1

(1,1) = 3

So known are 4, 1, 3

Let’s see if we can find a pattern from the first example.

For n=1, sum of neighbors = 33

Now, let’s try n=9 at (2,1)

But we don't know its neighbors.

Alternatively, let's try to see if there's a relation between n and the sum.

Alternatively, let's try to see the difference between n and its neighbors.

But given the time, perhaps I should try to find a general approach.

Let’s observe that in a regular hexagonal spiral, the numbers on the ring k (distance k from center) range from H_{k-1}+1 to H_k, where H_k = 3k(k-1)+1 is the k-th hexagonal number.

But in our spiral, the numbers don't seem to match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the offset is different.

Let’s try to see the ring numbers.

Let’s list the numbers on each "ring" from the sample.

Let’s define the center as ring 0: (0,1) = 1

Ring 1: all cells at Chebyshev distance 1 from (0,1)

That is, cells where max(|x|, |y-1|) = 1

From the sample, these are:

(1,1) = 3

(0,2) = 10

(-1,2) = 4

(-1,1) = 5

(0,0) = 9

(1,0) = 2

So the numbers on ring 1 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10

Sum = 2+3+4+5+9+10 = 33

As above.

Now, ring 2: max(|x|, |y-1|) = 2

From the sample:

(-2,1) = 15

(-3,1) = 14

(-3,0) = 16

(-2,0) = 6

(-2,2) = 4 (but 4 is already in ring 1)

Wait, (-2,2) = 4, but 4 is also at (-1,2) in ring 1? No, (-1,2)=4 in ring 1, (-2,2) is a new cell.

But in the sample, at y=2, x=-2 is 4

So (-2,2) = 4

But 4 is already used at (-1,2)

That can't be, unless the spiral allows repeats, which is not likely.

Let’s double-check the sample:

y=2: x=-3:14, x=-2:4, x=-1:3, x=0:10

So (-2,2)=4

But (-1,2)=3

So both are present.

But in a proper spiral, each number should be unique.

So perhaps the sample has a typo, or my coordinate mapping is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are not strictly increasing in the spiral order.

But let's proceed.

Let’s list all numbers from the sample:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,16

Missing 11,12,13

Let’s assume the spiral continues with 11,12,13, etc.

Now, for ring 2, let's list the cells with max(|x|, |y-1|) = 2

x = -2,-1,0,1,2

y = -1,0,1,2,3

But let's list only those within the shown or extrapolated grid.

Let’s suppose the following cells are in ring 2:

(-2,2), (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (2,-1), (2,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3), (-1,3)

But let's only consider those with |x| ≤ 3, |y| ≤ 3

But to avoid overcomplicating, let's try to find a general approach.

Let’s observe that for n=1 at the center of ring 0, the sum of its 6 neighbors is 33.

Now, let's see for n=10 at (0,2), which is on ring 1.

Neighbors of (0,2):

(1,2) = ? (not shown, let's call it A)

(0,3) = ? (B)

(-1,3) = ? (C)

(-1,2) = 4

(0,1) = 1

(1,1) = 3

So sum = A + B + C + 4 + 1 + 3 = A + B + C + 8

But we don't know A, B, C.

Alternatively, let's try to see the average.

Alternatively, let's notice that in a regular hexagonal spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is 6n + c for some constant c, or something similar, but it depends on the exact spiral.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, and since the spiral in the sample is not a standard one, perhaps the intended solution is to recognize that the sum of the 6 neighbors of any number n in this spiral is 6n + 3, or some linear function, but from n=1, sum=33, so 6*1 + 27 = 33, so c=27

But let's test with another n.

For n=2 at (1,0), if we could find its neighbors.

But from the sample, we only know some neighbors.

Alternatively, let’s try to see the difference between n and its neighbors for n=1:

Neighbors: 2,3,4,5,9,10

Differences: 1,2,3,4,8,9

No clear pattern.

Alternatively, let's notice that in the sample, the numbers on the ring around 1 are 2,3,4,5,9,10

Let’s see if these are consecutive or have a pattern.

From 2 to 10, but 6,7,8 are missing, but they appear in the next ring.

Perhaps the numbers on each ring are not consecutive.

Given the complexity and time, and since this is a puzzle, perhaps there's a shortcut.

Let’s try to see the sum for n=1 is 33

Now, let's try to see for n=9 at (2,1)

Assume the spiral is expanding outward, and the numbers increase as we move away from the center, but from the sample, 16 is at the "bottom left", and 14,15 are at the "top left".

Perhaps the numbers increase as we go clockwise or counterclockwise from a starting point.

Alternatively, let's try to see the step between numbers around the ring.

From 1 at (0,1), going clockwise:

1 -> 2 at (1,0) [down-right?]

But in the sample, from 1 at (0,1), right is 2 at (1,0)? But (1,0) is below and to the right.

From 1 at (0,1), down is 9 at (0,0)

Right is 2 at (1,0)

But let's try to trace a clockwise path around the center:

Start at (0,1) = 1

Move right to (1,1) = 3

But in the sample, (1,1) is not adjacent to 1 directly horizontally; rather, (1,0) is to the right and down.

Given the time I've spent and the risk of not resolving the coordinate system, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let’s notice that in a hexagonal grid, for any cell, the sum of the values of the 6 neighbors depends on the local density and the rate of increase of the numbers.

But since the spiral is deterministic, the sum of the neighbors of n can be found if we know the mapping from n to coordinates, and from coordinates to numbers.

Given the sample, we can try to find a formula for the number at (x, y).

Let’s try to fit a formula.

Let’s list the coordinates and numbers we have:

Let’s use (x, y), y increases upwards.

We have:

(0,1) = 1

(1,1) = 3

(-1,1) = 5

(-2,1) = 15

(-3,1) = 14

(-3,0) = 16

(-2,0) = 6

(-1,0) = 7

(0,0) = 8

(1,0) = 2

(2,1) = 9

(0,2) = 10

(-1,2) = 4

(-2,2) = 4 (but this can't be, unless it's a typo and should be another number)

Assume (-2,2) = 12 (let's assume the next number after 10 is 11 at (1,2), 12 at (-2,2), etc.)

But let's see the differences in x and y.

Let’s see if we can find a formula of the form:

n = a * (x + y) + b * (x - y) + c * (y - 1) + d

But with only a few points, we can try to solve for a, b, c, d.

Let’s use the known points.

Let’s use (0,1) = 1

Let’s use (1,1) = 3

Let’s use (-1,1) = 5

Let’s use (0,0) = 8

Let’s use (1,0) = 2

Let’s use (0,2) = 10

Let’s set up equations.

Let n = a*(x + y) + b*(x - y) + c*(y - 1) + d

For (0,1): x=0, y=1

n = a*(0+1) + b*(0-1) + c*(1-1) + d = a*1 + b*(-1) + c*0 + d = a - b + d = 1

For (1,1): x=1, y=1

n = a*(1+1) + b*(1-1) + c*(1-1) + d = a*2 + b*0 + c*0 + d = 2a + d = 3

For (-1,1): x=-1, y=1

n = a*(-1+1) + b*(-1-1) + c*(1-1) + d = a*0 + b*(-2) + c*0 + d = -2b + d = 5

For (0,0): x=0, y=0

n = a*(0+0) + b*(0-0) + c*(0-1) + d = a*0 + b*0 + c*(-1) + d = -c + d = 8

For (1,0): x=1, y=0

n = a*(1+0) + b*(1-0) + c*(0-1) + d = a*1 + b*1 + c*(-1) + d = a + b - c + d = 2

For (0,2): x=0, y=2

n = a*(0+2) + b*(0-2) + c*(2-1) + d = a*2 + b*(-2) + c*1 + d = 2a - 2b + c + d = 10

Now we have 6 equations:

1) a - b + d = 1

2) 2a + d = 3

3) -2b + d = 5

4) -c + d = 8

5) a + b - c + d = 2

6) 2a - 2b + c + d = 10

Let’s solve step by step.

From (2): 2a + d = 3 => d = 3 - 2a

From (1): a - b + d = 1

Substitute d:

a - b + (3 - 2a) = 1

a - b + 3 - 2a = 1

- a - b + 3 = 1

- a - b = -2

a + b = 2  ---> (A)

From (3): -2b + d = 5

d = 5 + 2b

But also d = 3 - 2a

So 3 - 2a = 5 + 2b

-2a - 2b = 2

-2(a + b) = 2

a + b = -1  ---> (B)

But from (A): a + b = 2

Contradiction.

So the formula is not of this form.

Let’s try a different form.

Let’s try n = p * (x^2 + y^2) + q * x + r * y + s * (y - 1) + t

But this may be overfitting.

Alternatively, let's notice that the numbers seem to increase as we move away from the center in certain directions.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, and since this is a logic puzzle, perhaps the sum of the 6 neighbors of any number n in this spiral is 6n + 3, but for n=1, sum=33, 6*1+3=9, not 33.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 6n + 27 for n=1, but for other n it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the 6 neighbors is always 6 times the average of the neighbors, but that's tautological.

Given the time I've invested without converging, I think I need to switch to a different strategy.

Let’s notice that in the sample, the numbers around 1 are 2,3,4,5,9,10

Let’s see the differences from 1:

1 to 2: +1

1 to 3: +2

1 to 4: +3

1 to 5: +4

1 to 9: +8

1 to 10: +9

No clear pattern.

But 2,3,4,5 are consecutive, then 9,10 are consecutive.

Perhaps the 6 neighbors are two sets of three consecutive numbers, offset by 7.

2,3,4 and 9,10,11 but 11 is not in the neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps in general, for a number n, the 6 neighbors are n-4, n-3, n-2, n-1, n+8, n+9 or something.

For n=1: 1-4=-3, not in the list.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is always 33 for the first ring, but for outer rings, it increases.

Alternatively, let’s try to find the number at a general position.

Let’s try to see the movement pattern from the sample.

From 1 at (0,1):

- Move left to 5 at (-1,1)
- Move left to 15 at (-2,1)
- Move left to 14 at (-3,1)
- Move down to 16 at (-3,0)
- Move right to 6 at (-2,0)
- Move right to 7 at (-1,0)
- Move right to 8 at (0,0)
- Move right to 2 at (1,0)
- Move up to 3 at (1,1)
- Move up to ? at (1,2)
- Move left to 10 at (0,2)
- Move left to 4 at (-1,2)
- Move left to ? at (-2,2)
- Move down to ? at (-2,1) (already visited)

But (-2,1) is 15, already visited.

Now, after (-1,2)=4, move left to (-2,2)= let's say 12

Then down to (-2,1)=15 (already visited)

So the path is:

1 (0,1)
5 (-1,1)
15 (-2,1)
14 (-3,1)
16 (-3,0)
6 (-2,0)
7 (-1,0)
8 (0,0)
2 (1,0)
3 (1,1)
11 (1,2)
10 (0,2)
4 (-1,2)
12 (-2,2)
Then perhaps down to (-2,1) (already visited)

Now let's assign numbers in this order:

1: (0,1)
2: (-1,1)
3: (-2,1)
4: (-3,1)
5: (-3,0)
6: (-2,0)
7: (-1,0)
8: (0,0)
9: (1,0)
10: (1,1)
11: (1,2)
12: (0,2)
13: (-1,2)
14: (-2,2)
15: (-3,1) but already assigned as 4
Wait, (-3,1) was assigned as 4, but in this path it's step 4

Let's number as we go:

Step 1: (0,1) = 1
Step 2: (-1,1) = 2
Step 3: (-2,1) = 3
Step 4: (-3,1) = 4
Step 5: (-3,0) = 5
Step 6: (-2,0) = 6
Step 7: (-1,0) = 7
Step 8: (0,0) = 8
Step 9: (1,0) = 9
Step 10: (1,1) = 10
Step 11: (1,2) = 11
Step 12: (0,2) = 12
Step 13: (-1,2) = 13
Step 14: (-2,2) = 14
Step 15: (-3,2) = 15
Step 16: (-3,1) but already assigned

But in the sample, (-3,1) = 14, (-3,0) = 16, (-2,1) = 15, etc.

This does not match the sample numbers.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, and since this is a puzzle likely intended to have a neat answer, I will assume that in this spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is 6n + 3, but for n=1, sum=33, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is always 33 for the first ring, and for higher rings, it's higher.

But for the number 2026, which is far from the center, the sum of the 6 neighbors can be approximated by 6 times the average value in the neighborhood.

But since the numbers increase roughly linearly with the ring number, and there are 6k numbers in ring k (approximately), the value at ring k is roughly proportional to k^2.

Let’s estimate the ring for n=2026.

The number of numbers up to ring k is approximately 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Set 1 + 3k(k+1) ≈ 2026

3k^2 + 3k + 1 ≈ 2026

3k^2 + 3k ≈ 2025

k^2 + k ≈ 675

k^2 + k - 675 = 0

k = [-1 + sqrt(1 + 4*675)]/2 = [-1 + sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2704) = 52, sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97

So k ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.5

So k ≈ 25

So n=2026 is on ring 25 or 26.

The numbers on ring k start from N_k = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 3k(k-1) + 2

Let’s check for k=1: 3*1*0 + 2 = 2

But ring 1 should start from 2

For k=2: 3*2*1 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8

But in our sample, ring 2 should start from after 10

But anyway, approximate value at (x,y) on ring k is about 3k^2

For k=25, 3*625 = 1875

For k=26, 3*676 = 2028

So n=2026 is near the end of ring 26 or start of 27.

But the exact value depends on the position.

But the six neighbors of n will be approximately n ± 1, n ± k, n ± (k+1), or something similar, but in a hex grid, the differences are offsets in the 6 directions.

But since the spiral is roughly radially symmetric, the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is approximately 6n.

But from n=1, sum=33, which is much larger than 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 6n + 27 for n=1, but for large n, the constant is negligible.

But let's try to see the difference for
