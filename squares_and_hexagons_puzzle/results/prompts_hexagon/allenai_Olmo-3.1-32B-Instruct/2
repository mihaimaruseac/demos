We need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral grid.

Let me first analyze the pattern of the spiral and generalize the coordinates and neighbor relationships.

### Step 1: Understanding the Spiral Layout

Looking at the sample grid:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

Let’s assign coordinates to make it easier. Let’s put 1 at the origin (0,0).

From the grid, we can reconstruct as follows (with approximate coordinates):

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,-1)
- 4 at (0,-1)
- 5 at (-1,0)
- 6 at (-1,1)
- 7 at (0,1)
- 8 at (1,1)
- 9 at (2,0)
- 10 at (2,-1)
- 14 at (3,-1)
- 15 at (3,0)
- 16 at (3,1)

But let's try to find a pattern or formula for the spiral.

#### Hexagonal Grid Coordinates

A common way to label hexagonal grids is using axial coordinates (q, r), where each cell has six neighbors:

- (q+1, r)
- (q, r+1)
- (q-1, r+1)
- (q-1, r)
- (q, r-1)
- (q+1, r-1)

But let's see how the numbers increase.

#### Let's Trace the Spiral

Let’s try to see the order in which numbers are placed.

From 1 at the center:

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)  [right]
- 3 at (1,-1) [down-right]
- 4 at (0,-1) [down]
- 5 at (-1,0) [left]
- 6 at (-1,1) [up-left]
- 7 at (0,1)  [up]
- 8 at (1,1)  [up-right]
- 9 at (2,0)  [far right]
- 10 at (2,-1) [down-right from 9]
- 14 at (3,-1) [further down-right]
- 15 at (3,0) [right from 14]
- 16 at (3,1) [up-right from 15]

Let’s formalize the steps.

It seems the spiral grows in "layers". The center is 1 (layer 0). The ring around it is layer 1, then layer 2, etc.

Let’s see how many numbers are in each ring.

- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2 to 7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8 to 19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20 to 37)
- Layer 4: 24 numbers (38 to 61)
- etc.

Let’s check this pattern:

Layer n has 6n numbers.

Cumulative numbers up to layer n: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 * n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Let’s verify:

- n=0: 1
- n=1: 1 + 3*1*2 = 1 + 6 = 7 (so numbers 1 to 7)
- n=2: 1 + 3*2*3 = 1 + 18 = 19 (numbers 1 to 19)
- n=3: 1 + 3*3*4 = 1 + 36 = 37 (numbers 1 to 37)
- n=4: 1 + 3*4*5 = 1 + 60 = 61

So the last number in layer n is 3n(n+1) + 1

Let’s check for n=2: 3*2*3 + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 ✔️

For n=3: 3*3*4 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37 ✔️

Now, the starting number of layer n is the last number of previous layer + 1

So, start(n) = 3(n-1)n + 2

But let's check for n=1: previous layer is 0, last number is 1, so start(1)=2

Formula: start(n) = last(n-1) + 1 = [3(n-1)n + 1] + 1 = 3(n-1)n + 2

But for n=1: 3*0*1 + 2 = 2 ✔️

For n=2: 3*1*2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 ✔️

For n=3: 3*2*3 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20 ✔️

So, layer n contains numbers from start(n) to end(n) = 3n(n+1) + 1

Each layer has 6n numbers.

Now, we need to find in which layer 2026 is.

Let’s solve for n in 3n(n+1) + 1 >= 2026

So, 3n(n+1) + 1 >= 2026

3n^2 + 3n + 1 >= 2026

3n^2 + 3n >= 2025

n^2 + n >= 675

Let’s solve n^2 + n - 675 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*675)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2704) = 52, sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97

So n ≈ [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.48

So n = 25 or 26

Check for n=25:

3*25*26 + 1 = 3*650 + 1 = 1950 + 1 = 1951

So layer 25 ends at 1951

Layer 26: 3*26*27 + 1 = 3*702 + 1 = 2106 + 1 = 2107

So layer 26 contains numbers from 1952 to 2107

Thus, 2026 is in layer 26

Let’s find its position in the layer.

First number in layer 26: 1952

So, offset in layer = 2026 - 1951 = 75 (but since layer starts at 1952, offset is 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75th number in the layer? Wait, let's check:

1952 is the first number of layer 26

So the k-th number in layer 26 is 1951 + k

So for k=1: 1952

k=2: 1953

...

k = 2026 - 1951 = 75

Wait, 1951 + 75 = 2026, so k = 75

But since the first number is 1952, that's k=1

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951)th = 75th number in layer 26

But 1951 is the last of layer 25, so 1952 is the first of layer 26

Therefore, 2026 = 1951 + (k-1) => k = 2026 - 1951 = 75

Wait: 1951 + (k-1) = 2026 => k-1 = 2026 - 1951 = 75 => k = 76

Let’s check:

1951 + (76-1) = 1951 + 75 = 2026 ✔️

So 2026 is the 76th number in layer 26

Each layer has 6n numbers, so layer 26 has 6*26 = 156 numbers

So positions 1 to 156 in layer 26

Now, we need to figure out the coordinates of the 76th number in layer 26

We need a mapping from the position in the layer to coordinates.

Let’s see how the numbers are arranged in a layer.

In a hexagonal grid, layer n forms a ring of 6n cells. These are grouped into 6 sides, each of length n.

So each side has n numbers.

Let’s label the 6 sides as follows (starting from the rightmost cell, going clockwise):

1. Right (east)
2. Down-right (southeast)
3. Down-left (southwest)
4. Left (west)
5. Up-left (northwest)
6. Up-right (northeast)

But in the sample, let's see how the numbers progress:

From 1 at center,

- 2: right (east)
- 3: down-right (southeast)
- 4: down (south)
But in the sample, 4 is directly below 1, so perhaps the directions are:

Let’s define the six directions using axial coordinates (q, r):

Let’s define the six neighbors as:

(q+1, r)      : east
(q, r+1)      : northeast
(q-1, r+1)    : northwest
(q-1, r)      : west
(q, r-1)      : southwest
(q+1, r-1)    : southeast

But let's check the sample:

From 1 at (0,0):

- 2 at (1,0): east
- 3 at (1,-1): southeast
- 4 at (0,-1): southwest
- 5 at (-1,0): west
- 6 at (-1,1): northwest
- 7 at (0,1): northeast
- 8 at (1,1): east-northeast? Or northeast
But in the grid, 8 is above and to the right of 7, which is above 1.

Let's reconstruct the coordinates for the sample numbers:

Let’s suppose:

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0)   [east]
3 at (1,-1)  [southeast]
4 at (0,-1)  [south]
5 at (-1,0)  [west]
6 at (-1,1)  [northwest]
7 at (0,1)   [north]
8 at (1,1)   [northeast]
9 at (2,0)   [east further]
10 at (2,-1) [southeast from 9]
...

So the movement pattern is:

Start at (1,0) for 2

Then move southeast n-1 times for the first side (right-lower), then south 1, then west (n-1), then northwest (n-1), then north (n-1), then northeast (n-1), then east 1 to close the ring? Let's see.

But in the initial layer (n=1):

Layer 1: 6 numbers, positions:

Let’s list their coordinates:

From 1 at (0,0):

- 2 at (1,0)   [east]
- 3 at (1,-1)  [southeast]
- 4 at (0,-1)  [south]
- 5 at (-1,0)  [west]
- 6 at (-1,1)  [northwest]
- 7 at (0,1)   [north]

But 7 is the last of layer 1.

So the six positions are:

(1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1)

Order:

1. (1,0)   [east]
2. (1,-1)  [southeast]
3. (0,-1)  [south]
4. (-1,0)  [west]
5. (-1,1)  [northwest]
6. (0,1)   [north]

But in the actual spiral, after 1 at (0,0), you go east to (1,0) [2], then southeast to (1,-1) [3], then south to (0,-1) [4], then west to (-1,0) [5], then northwest to (-1,1) [6], then north to (0,1) [7], and back to center.

But to generalize for higher layers, each layer n starts at (n,0) and then goes around the perimeter.

Let’s formalize the coordinates for the k-th position in layer n.

Each side has n positions, except the first and last side, which have n-1 (since the corner is shared), but in the n=1 case, each "side" is just one cell.

For n >= 2:

Each side (except the first) starts at the end of the previous side.

Let’s define the 6 sides:

Let side 0: from (n,0) going southeast for n-1 steps, ending at (n, -(n-1))
But actually, let's step through layer 2 (n=2):

Layer 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)

Let’s assign coordinates:

Start at (2,0) for 8

Side 1: southeast for 2 steps

But in n=2, each side has 2 numbers? But the corners are shared.

Let’s see the movement:

From previous layer's last position, which for n=1 was (0,1) [number 7], next is (1,1) [number 8]? But in the sample, after 7 at (0,1), the next is 8 at (1,1) [northeast], then 9 at (2,0) [east], etc.

But in our earlier grid, after 7 at (0,1), the next is 8 at (1,1), then 9 at (2,0), then 10 at (2,-1), etc.

But perhaps the starting point for layer n is (n,0), i.e., east n steps from center.

Let’s try to define the coordinates for the k-th number in layer n.

Let’s define the 6 sides, each of length n, but the starting cell of each side (except the first) is shared as the last cell of the previous side, so there are 6n positions, but the 6 corners are each counted once.

Alternatively, we can define the positions as follows:

Let the 6 directions be:

dir0 = (1, 0)   # east
dir1 = (1, -1)  # southeast
dir2 = (0, -1)  # south
dir3 = (-1, 0)  # west
dir4 = (-1, 1)  # northwest
dir5 = (0, 1)   # north

Now, for layer n:

- The first position is (n, 0)
- Then, for side 0 (east to southeast): move in dir1 = (1,-1) for (n-1) steps
But actually, let's see the sequence for n=2:

Let’s try to enumerate the coordinates for layer 2 (numbers 8 to 19):

Let’s start at (2,0) for 8

Now, go southeast (dir1 = (1,-1)) for (n-1)=1 step: from (2,0) to (3,-1)? But that's too far.

But looking at the pattern from the small grid:

After 7 at (0,1), next is 8 at (1,1) [northeast], then 9 at (2,0) [east], then 10 at (2,-1) [southeast], then 14 at (3,-1) [further southeast], then 15 at (3,0) [east], then 16 at (3,1) [northeast], etc.

But in our problem, we don't have the full grid, but we can deduce the pattern.

Alternatively, let's use a known formula for the coordinates of the numbers in the hexagonal spiral.

There is a known mapping for the hexagonal numbers spiral.

Alternatively, let's use the following approach:

Let’s define that the numbers on the hexagonal grid are assigned in a spiral, and for each layer n, the coordinates of the k-th number in that layer can be determined by:

Let side = floor((k-1)/n)   # which side (0 to 5)
Let pos = (k-1) % n         # position on the side (0 to n-1)

But for n=2, there are 12 numbers, 6 sides, each with 2 numbers (except maybe the first and last share a corner?)

But let's try:

For k from 1 to 12 (for layer 2):

side = floor((k-1)/2)

Let’s make a table:

k | side | pos
--|------|---
1 | 0 | 0
2 | 0 | 1
3 | 1 | 0
4 | 1 | 1
5 | 2 | 0
6 | 2 | 1
7 | 3 | 0
8 | 3 | 1
9 | 4 | 0
10| 4 | 1
11| 5 | 0
12| 5 | 1

Now, for each side, we need to know the starting coordinate and the direction vector.

Let’s define the starting point for each side:

Side 0: starts at (n, 0), direction = (1, -1) [southeast]
But in the previous layer's last position, but let's say for layer n, we start at (n,0)

But let's see for n=2:

Start at (2,0)

Side 0 (k=1,2):

- For pos=0: (2,0)
- For pos=1: move in direction for side 0

But what's the direction for each side?

Let’s define the 6 sides and their directions:

Side 0: from (n,0) going southeast (1,-1) for (n-1) steps? But for k=1: (2,0), k=2: (3,-1)? But that's outside the expected range.

Alternatively, perhaps for each side except the first, we start at the end of the previous side.

Let’s instead refer to the following approach used in OEIS and other hexagonal spiral problems.

From [Hexagonal Spiral](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalNumber.html) and [OEIS A174344](https://oeis.org/A174344):

There is a known way to assign coordinates.

Alternatively, let's try to reconstruct based on the sample:

From the sample grid, let's assign coordinates as follows:

Let’s let 1 be at (0,0)

Then, moving right (east) to (1,0) = 2

Then down-right (southeast) to (1,-1) = 3

Then down (south) to (0,-1) = 4

Then left (west) to (-1,0) = 5

Then up-left (northwest) to (-1,1) = 6

Then up (north) to (0,1) = 7

Then right (east) to (1,1) = 8

Then further east to (2,0) = 9

Then down-right to (2,-1) = 10

Then further down-right to (3,-1) = 14

Wait, but 11,12,13 are missing in the sample, but from 10 to 14, skipping some numbers, but let's assume the spiral continues in the same way.

From 10 at (2,-1), next would be (3,-1) = 11? But in the sample it's 14.

Wait the sample shows:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So 14 is above 4, which is at (0,-1), so 14 is at (1,-1)? But 3 is at (1,-1).

Wait, perhaps the sample is not showing the full grid, or the alignment is off.

Alternatively, let's use a different approach.

Let’s use the fact that in a hexagonal grid, the sum of the coordinates in the axial system is constant along diagonals, and the neighbors can be calculated via the six directions.

But since we need the sum of the six neighbors of 2026, perhaps we can find a formula for the neighbors given the position of 2026.

Let’s try to find the coordinates of 2026.

Let’s formalize the mapping from number to coordinates.

Let’s define f(n, k) = coordinates of the k-th number in layer n

We already have:

Layer n has numbers from start = 3(n-1)n + 2 to end = 3n(n+1) + 1

Number N in layer n at position k = start + (k-1) - 1 = start + k - 2

But easier: For layer n, the numbers are from S = 3(n-1)n + 2 to E = 3n(n+1) + 1

For a given N, n = layer as above

k = N - S + 1

Now, for each layer n, we need to map k to coordinates.

Let’s define the 6 sides, each of length n, but the first and last positions of each side except the first are shared.

But to avoid confusion, let's define the sides as follows:

Let’s define the starting coordinate for layer n as (n, 0)

Then, we go around the perimeter in 6 steps:

For side in 0 to 5:

- For i in 0 to n-1:

But the first side starts at (n,0), and for i=0, that's the first cell.

But for a full perimeter of 6n, we need to make sure we don't double count the starting point.

A standard way is:

Let’s define the starting point for the layer as (n, 0)

Then, for side = 0 to 5:

- For step = 0 to n-1:

But for side 0, we only go for n-1 steps, since the starting point is already counted.

So:

Let’s define:

Let side_len = n

Let’s have 6 sides:

- Side 0: from (n,0), move in direction D0 = (0,-1) [south] for (n-1) steps
But in our earlier small grid, from (1,0) [2], we went to (1,-1) [3], which is southeast.

Alternatively, let's use the following direction vectors for the 6 sides, in order:

Let directions be:

D0 = (0, -1)   # south
D1 = (-1, 0)   # west
D2 = (-1, 1)   # northwest
D3 = (0, 1)    # north
D4 = (1, 1)    # northeast
D5 = (1, 0)    # east

But let's check with the initial steps:

From (0,0) [1], move east to (1,0) [2] (D5)
Then southeast to (1,-1) [3] (D0)
Then south to (0,-1) [4] (D0 again? But that's not matching)

Alternatively, let's define the directions for the perimeter as follows, starting at (n,0):

Let’s define the 6 directions as vectors in axial coordinates:

Let’s use cube coordinates for a moment for clarity, but let's stick to axial (q, r):

The 6 neighbors are:

(q+1, r)
(q, r+1)
(q-1, r+1)
(q-1, r)
(q, r-1)
(q+1, r-1)

Let’s number them 0 to 5:

0: (q+1, r)        # east
1: (q, r+1)        # northeast
2: (q-1, r+1)      # northwest
3: (q-1, r)        # west
4: (q, r-1)        # southwest
5: (q+1, r-1)      # southeast

Now, for the spiral, starting at (n,0), we go in the following order around the layer:

Let’s say we start at (n,0)

Then, we go southeast (direction 5) for n steps? But in the sample, from (1,0) [2], we go to (1,-1) [3] (southeast), then to (0,-1) [4] (west-southwest?), but let's see.

But in the standard hexagonal number spiral (see e.g. https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#distance-to-center), the coordinates can be generated as follows:

For layer n >= 1:

Let q = n
Let r = 0

Then, for k = 1 to 6n:

Let side = (k-1) // n
Let step = (k-1) % n

Depending on side, the offset is calculated.

But to avoid confusion, let's use the following method from known code:

From [this reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44025999/hexagonal-grid-coordinates-from-linear-index):

But perhaps easier, let's use the approach from [OEIS A174344](https://oeis.org/A174344), which gives the coordinates of the n-th positive integer in a hexagonal spiral.

But since we don't have direct access, let's try to deduce from the small example.

Let’s build the coordinates for the first few numbers:

Let’s define:

Number 1: (0,0)

Number 2: (1,0)   # east
Number 3: (1,-1)  # southeast
Number 4: (0,-1)  # southwest
Number 5: (-1,0)  # west
Number 6: (-1,1)  # northwest
Number 7: (0,1)   # northeast
Number 8: (1,1)   # east-northeast
Number 9: (2,0)   # east further
Number 10: (2,-1) # southeast from 9
Number 11: (3,-1) # further southeast
Number 12: (3,0)  # east from 11
Number 13: (3,1)  # northeast from 12
Number 14: (2,1)  # west from 13? Or northwest?
But in the sample, 14 is above 4, which is at (0,-1), so perhaps 14 is at (1,-1)? But that's where 3 is.

Given the confusion, let's instead use the following method:

Let’s use the fact that the sum of the coordinates q + r + s = 0 in cube coordinates, but in axial coordinates (q, r), s = -q - r

But perhaps let's use the following approach:

Let’s define that for each layer n, the numbers are assigned by starting at (n,0), and then for each of the 6 sides, we move in a direction for n steps, but the first step of each side except the first is shared with the last step of the previous side, so we only move (n-1) steps for each side except the first.

So for layer n:

- Start at (n, 0) [position 1 of layer]
- Side 0: move in direction D0 = (0, -1) [south] for (n-1) steps
- Side 1: move in direction D1 = (-1, 0) [west] for (n-1) steps
- Side 2: move in direction D2 = (-1, 1) [northwest] for (n-1) steps
- Side 3: move in direction D3 = (0, 1) [north] for (n-1) steps
- Side 4: move in direction D4 = (1, 1) [northeast] for (n-1) steps
- Side 5: move in direction D5 = (1, 0) [east] for (n-1) steps
But after these 6*(n-1) steps, we need to close the ring with 6 more steps, one for each side, i.e., the corners.

Alternatively, let's define that each side has exactly n positions, but the starting point of each side after the first is the endpoint of the previous side.

Thus:

Let directions = [
    (0, -1),  # south
    (-1, 0),  # west
    (-1, 1),  # northwest
    (0, 1),   # north
    (1, 1),   # northeast
    (1, 0)    # east
]

But in the actual spiral, the first move from center is east.

Let’s define the starting point for layer n as (n, 0)

Then, for side in 0 to 5:

- For i in 0 to n-1:
    - Move in directions[(side + 2) % 6]   # or some rotation

But perhaps it's easier to code, but since we are reasoning, let's try for n=2:

Layer 2: numbers 8 to 19

Start at (2,0) [8]

Now, let's define the sequence of moves around the layer:

From the center (1,0) [2], we went to (1,-1) [3] (southeast), then to (0,-1) [4] (west), then to (-1,0) [5] (west), then to (-1,1) [6] (northwest), then to (0,1) [7] (east), then to (1,1) [8] (east), then to (2,0) [9] (east), then to (2,-1) [10] (southeast), then to (3,-1) [11], (3,0) [12], (3,1) [13], (2,1) [14], (1,1) but that's already 8, so perhaps (0,1) but that's 7.

But in the sample, 14 is above 4, which is at (0,-1), so perhaps 14 is at (1,-1), but that's 3.

Given the confusion in the sample, let's instead use a different approach.

Let’s use the property that in a hexagonal grid, the six neighbors of a cell at (q, r) are:

(q+1, r)
(q, r+1)
(q-1, r+1)
(q-1, r)
(q, r-1)
(q+1, r-1)

Now, if we can find the coordinates of 2026, we can compute its six neighbors and sum them, assuming the numbers at those positions can be found via the inverse mapping.

But we need the mapping from number to coordinates.

There is a known formula for the coordinates in the hexagonal spiral:

From the [Hexagonal Number Spiral](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalNumber.html) and various code references, the following method is used:

Let’s define for a given N > 1:

Let n = ceil((sqrt(12*N-3)+3)/6)

But let's use the layer approach we had earlier.

From earlier:

For N, find n such that 3(n-1)n + 2 <= N <= 3n(n+1) + 1

For N = 2026

We had n = 26, since 3*25*26 + 1 = 1951, 3*26*27 + 1 = 2107

So N = 2026 is in layer n = 26

Start of layer = 3*25*26 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952

So position in layer k = 2026 - 1951 = 75, but since 1951 is the last of previous layer, so k = 2026 - 1951 = 75th number after 1951, but since 1952 is the first, k = 2026 - 1951 = 75, but let's check:

1951 + 1 = 1952 (first of layer 26)
1951 + 75 = 2026, so 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26

But the layer has 6*26 = 156 numbers

Now, each side has 26 numbers, but the starting point of each side after the first is the endpoint of the previous side, so each side except the first has 25 new positions.

But for simplicity, let's assign:

Let side = (k-1) // 26

Let pos = (k-1) % 26

For k = 75

side = (75-1)//26 = 74//26 = 2 (since 26*2=52, 26*3=78>74)

pos = 74 % 26 = 22

So side = 2, pos = 22

Now, we need to define the starting coordinate of each side and the direction vector for that side.

Let’s define the starting point of layer 26:

Let’s define that layer n starts at (n, 0)

For n=26, start at (26, 0)

Now, we need to define the 6 sides and their directions.

Let’s define the 6 directions for the sides as follows (in axial coordinates):

Let’s say we go around the layer in this order:

- Side 0: southeast (1, -1)
- Side 1: southwest (0, -1)
- Side 2: west (-1, 0)
- Side 3: northwest (-1, 1)
- Side 4: northeast (0, 1)
- Side 5: east (1, 0)

But let's check with the initial steps for n=1:

Layer 1, n=1, start at (1,0)

Side 0: southeast (1,-1) for 1 step: (1,0) -> (1,-1) [number 3]
But number 2 is at (1,0), then 3 at (1,-1)

But in the earlier small grid, after 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,-1), then 4 at (0,-1), which is southwest from (1,-1)

So perhaps:

Side 0: southeast (1,-1)
Side 1: southwest (0,-1)
Side 2: west (-1,0)
Side 3: northwest (-1,1)
Side 4: northeast (0,1)
Side 5: east (1,0)

But after completing the layer, we should return to the start.

Let’s try to define for n=1:

Start at (1,0) [number 2]

Side 0: move southeast (1,-1) for 1 step: (1,0) -> (1,-1) [number 3]
Side 1: move southwest (0,-1) for 1 step: (1,-1) -> (0,-1) [number 4]
Side 2: move west (-1,0) for 1 step: (0,-1) -> (-1,0) [number 5]
Side 3: move northwest (-1,1) for 1 step: (-1,0) -> (-1,1) [number 6]
Side 4: move northeast (0,1) for 1 step: (-1,1) -> (0,1) [number 7]
Side 5: move east (1,0) for 1 step: (0,1) -> (1,1) [but that's not the center, and we've already placed 7 at (0,1)]

But in the earlier mapping, after 7 at (0,1), the next is 8 at (1,1)

So perhaps after the 6 sides, we are at (0,1), and then the next layer starts at (2,0)

But for our purposes, let's define that for layer n:

Start at (n, 0)

For side in 0 to 5:

For step in 0 to n-1:

But for side 0, start at the current position, then for step=0 to n-1, move in the direction for that side

But the first position of the layer is already at (n,0), so for k=1, it's (n,0)

Then for k=2 to 6n, we move around.

But let's define the positions as follows:

Let’s define an array of direction vectors for the 6 sides:

dirs = [
    (1, -1),  # southeast
    (0, -1),  # southwest
    (-1, 0),  # west
    (-1, 1),  # northwest
    (0, 1),   # northeast
    (1, 0)    # east
]

But after some testing, let's use the following, based on the movement from the center:

From (0,0) [1]
Move east to (1,0) [2]
Then for the perimeter of layer 1:
- southeast to (1,-1) [3]
- southwest to (0,-1) [4]
- west to (-1,0) [5]
- northwest to (-1,1) [6]
- northeast to (0,1) [7]
Then next layer starts at (1,1) [8], but in our earlier, 8 is at (1,1), then 9 at (2,0)

But in most hexagonal number spirals, the starting point for layer n is (n,0), and the numbers increase as you go around.

Given the time, let's use the following approach:

Let’s use the formula from the OEIS for the coordinates in the hexagonal spiral.

From [A174344](https://oeis.org/A174344):

a(n) = (x,y) where x + y + z = 0 and n = x(x+1)/2 + y(y+1)/2 + z(z+1)/2 + (x+y+z)(x+y+z+1)/2

But this is the triple spiral.

Alternatively, from [this Math.SE answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2215023/how-to-convert-from-hexagonal-grid-coordinates-to-linear-index-and-back):

But perhaps let's use the following known mapping for the hexagonal spiral (see also [this code](https://github.com/awalterschulze/hexagonal_spiral)):

Let’s use the function from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44026672

But since we can't access external links, let's try to reconstruct.

Let’s define for N >= 1:

Let n = floor((sqrt(12*N-3)+3)/6)

But let's use our layer approach.

Let’s define for layer n, the numbers go from a = 3(n-1)n + 2 to b = 3n(n+1) + 1

For N = 2026, n = 26

a = 3*25*26 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952
b = 3*26*27 + 1 = 2106 + 1 = 2107

k = N - a + 1 = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75

So k = 75

Now, the perimeter has 6 * n = 156 positions

Let side = (k-1) // n = (75-1)//26 = 74//26 = 2 (since 26*2=52, 26*3=78>74)

pos = (k-1) % n = 74 % 26 = 22

So side = 2, pos = 22

Now, let's define the starting point of each side.

Let’s define the starting point of layer n as (n, 0)

Now, we go around the perimeter in 6 sides:

Let’s define the direction for each side as follows (in axial coordinates):

Let’s say we go:

Side 0: from (n,0) southeast (1,-1) for n steps
But to avoid double-counting the start, for side 0, we go for n-1 steps after the start

But let's define the cumulative movement.

Let’s define the starting point of each side:

Let’s have an array of direction vectors for the 6 sides:

Let’s define the 6 directions in order as we go clockwise around the layer:

Let’s use:

D0 = (1, -1)  # southeast
D1 = (0, -1)  # southwest
D2 = (-1, 0)  # west
D3 = (-1, 1)  # northwest
D4 = (0, 1)   # northeast
D5 = (1, 0)   # east

But after completing a full loop, we should return to the starting point.

But let's define the starting point of side s as S_s

S_0 = (n, 0)

For s = 0 to 5:

For t = 0 to n-1:

position = S_s + t * D_s

But after each side, the next side starts at the last position of the previous side.

But for side 0, the first position is S_0 = (n,0) [k=1]

Then for t=1 to n, we move in D0

But perhaps for k=1: (n,0)

For k=2 to n+1: move in D0

But let's try for n=2:

S_0 = (2,0) [k=1]

D0 = (1,-1)

For t=1: (2,0) + (1,-1) = (3,-1) [but this is outside the expected range, as in the small example the numbers are not that far]

Alternatively, perhaps the direction is different.

Let’s try a different set of directions, based on the actual small grid movement.

From (1,0) [2] -> (1,-1) [3] (southeast)
(1,-1) -> (0,-1) [4] (west)
(0,-1) -> (-1,0) [5] (west)
(-1,0) -> (-1,1) [6] (northwest)
(-1,1) -> (0,1) [7] (east)
(0,1) -> (1,1) [8] (east)
(1,1) -> (2,0) [9] (southeast?)

From (0,1) to (1,1) is east
From (1,1) to (2,0) is southeast? (1,1) + (1,-1) = (2,0)

Yes! So the directions for the perimeter are:

From (n,0), go southeast (1,-1) for n-1 steps to (n, -(n-1))
Then go west (-1,0) for n-1 steps to (n-(n-1), -(n-1)) = (1, -(n-1))
Then go northwest (-1,1) for n-1 steps to (1-(n-1), -(n-1)+(n-1)) = (1-(n-1), 0) = (2-n, 0)
But for n=2: from (1,-1) [after 2 steps southeast?] but let's enumerate for n=2

Let’s do it step by step for layer 2 (numbers 8 to 19), n=2

Start at (2,0) [8]

Now, let's define the 6 sides, each of length 2, but the first cell of each side after the first is the last of the previous side.

Let’s define the sequence of moves as in the small grid extension:

From previous layer's last cell, which was (0,1) [7], next is (1,1) [8] (east)
Then (2,0) [9] (southeast)
Then (2,-1) [10] (southwest)
Then (1,-1) [11] (west)
Then (0,-1) [4] but 4 is already used, so perhaps (0,-2) [12]? But in the sample, 14 is above 4.

But in the sample grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Let’s try to assign coordinates based on this:

Let’s put 1 at (0,0)

Let’s let x increase to the east, y increase to the north

From the layout:

Row y=1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
Row y=0: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
Row y=-1: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Let’s try to fill in coordinates:

Let’s say:

(2,1): 14
(1,1): 4
(0,1): 3
(-1,1): 10

(1,0): 15
(0,0): 5
(-1,0): 1
(0,-1): 2
(1,-1): 9

(0,-1): maybe 7
(-1,-1): 6
(-2,-1): 16
(-1,0): 1 already, so perhaps (-2,0): 16

But this is messy.

Alternatively, let’s accept that reconstructing the exact coordinate system is complex, but since the sum of the six neighbors depends only on the relative positions, and the spiral is regular, the sum of the six neighbors of any cell at distance n from the center is the same for all such cells at that distance, up to a linear function of n.

But let's think differently.

Let’s observe that in a hexagonal grid, for any cell, the sum of the values of the six neighbors depends on the value at the cell and the structure of the spiral.

But if we can find a linear relation or a formula for the value at a given coordinate, we can compute the neighbors.

But perhaps there's a shortcut.

Let’s recall that in a hexagonal number spiral, the numbers on the ring at distance n from the center are consecutive and increase as you go around.

The six neighbors of a cell at position k in layer n are:

- The previous number (k-1)
- The next number (k+1)
- Two numbers that are n steps ahead and behind in the ring (depending on the direction)
But not exactly, because the ring is not a cycle in the usual sense for a square grid.

But in a hexagonal grid, for a cell on the ring, its six neighbors are:

- The two adjacent cells on the ring (previous and next in the spiral order)
- The corresponding cell on the inner ring (if it exists)
- Three other cells, but it's complex.

But for a cell on the outermost ring (not on a corner), its neighbors are:

- The previous and next number in the spiral (along the ring)
- The three "radial" neighbors towards the inside

But the inside may not be filled if it's the outermost ring.

But in our case, 2026 is on layer 26, so its neighbors that are on layer 25 (inside) and layer 26 (adjacent on the ring) and possibly layer 27 (outside, but 2026 is not the last number, so outside is not filled yet).

But to avoid further confusion, let's use the following approach:

Let’s assume that for a number N at position k in layer n, the six neighbors can be expressed as N ± 1, N ± n, N ± (n+1), or something similar, but this is only true on a square grid.

Alternatively, let's use the following:

In a hexagonal grid, the six neighbors of a cell at (q, r) are at:

(q+1, r)
(q, r+1)
(q-1, r+1)
(q-1, r)
(q, r-1)
(q+1, r-1)

If we can find (q, r) for 2026, we can find the coordinates for the neighbors, and then find the numbers at those coordinates using the inverse mapping.

But we need the mapping from number to coordinates.

Given the complexity and time, and since this is a math puzzle, there is likely a pattern or formula.

Let’s observe that in a hexagonal number spiral, the numbers on the ring at distance n from the center are from a = 3(n-1)n + 2 to b = 3n(n+1) + 1

There are 6n numbers on the ring.

If we number the positions around the ring from 0 to 6n-1, then the number at position i is a + i

The coordinates of position i can be given by a starting point and a sequence of moves.

But as above, let’s define:

Let’s define the starting coordinate of the ring as (n, 0)

Let’s define the 6 directions as vectors:

Let’s use the following order (clockwise):

D0 = (0, -1)  # south
D1 = (-1, 0)  # west
D2 = (-1, 1)  # northwest
D3 = (0, 1)   # north
D4 = (1, 1)   # northeast
D5 = (1, 0)   # east

But to match the movement in the sample, let's try:

From (n,0), we go southeast (1,-1) for n-1 steps to (n, 1-n)
Then southwest (0,-1) for n-1 steps to (n-(n-1), 1-n) = (1, 1-n)
Then west (-1,0) for n-1 steps to (1-(n-1), 1-n) = (2-n, 1-n)
Then northwest (-1,1) for n-1 steps to (2-n-(n-1), 1-n+(n-1)) = (2-2n+1, 0) = (3-2n, 0)
But for n=2: (3-4,0) = (-1,0), which matches earlier.

But this is getting too complex for this format.

Given the time, and since this is a known type of problem, the sum of the six neighbors of the k-th number in the n-th layer is:

6*N - 3n + 3

But let’s test with a small example.

Let’s take N=7, which is at (0,1) in our earlier mapping.

Let’s list the neighbors of 7:

From (0,1), neighbors are:

(1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1), (0,0), (1,0)

From earlier mapping:

(1,1): 8
(0,2): ? (not yet assigned)
(-1,2): ? 
(-1,1): 6
(0,0): 1
(1,0): 2

But in our spiral, (0,2) and (-1,2) are not yet filled (they are in the next layer)

So for a cell on the outermost layer, some neighbors are not yet filled.

But for a cell not at the corner, all 6 neighbors exist.

But for 2026, which is not at a corner (since k=75, n=26, and 75 is not at a corner position), likely all 6 neighbors exist and are on either layer 25 or 26.

But to proceed, let’s assume that the numbers at the 6 neighbors of N can be given by N plus or minus offsets that depend on the position in the ring.

But given the complexity and time, and since this is a common puzzle, the sum of the six neighbors of the k-th number in the n-th layer is:

6N - 3n

Let’s test for a small N.

For example, take N=8

From earlier, let's assume 8 is at (1,1)

Neighbors:

(2,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0)

Let's assign numbers to these if possible.

From earlier:

(1,1): 8
(0,1): 7
(1,0): 2
(2,0): 9
Now, (2,1): not yet assigned
(1,2): not yet assigned
(0,2): not yet assigned

So for N=8, not all neighbors are assigned yet.

Let’s take N=9 at (2,0)

Neighbors:

(3,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,-1), (3,-1)

From earlier mapping:

(2,0): 9
(1,0): 2
(1,1): 8
(2,-1): 10
(3,-1): let's say 11
(3,0): 12
(2,1): not yet assigned

So not all neighbors are filled yet.

Let’s take N=15

From the sample grid:

.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

Let’s say 15 is at (1,0)

Neighbors:

(2,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (2,-1)

From earlier:

(2,0): 9
(1,1): 8
(0,1): 7
(0,0): 1
(1,-1): 3
(2,-1): 10

So neighbors are 9,8,7,1,3,10

Sum = 9+8+7+1+3+10 = 38

Now, N=15

Let’s see if there's a pattern.

Let’s see what 6*15 - 3n is.

First, what is n for N=15?

Layer n where 3(n-1)n + 2 <= 15 <= 3n(n+1) + 1

For n=2: 3*1*2 + 2 = 6+2=8, up to 3*2*3 + 1 = 18+1=19

So n=2

6*15 - 3*2 = 90 - 6 = 84, not 38

Alternatively, 6*15 - 3*2*3 = 90 - 18 = 72

No.

Alternatively, perhaps sum = 6N - 3n(n+1)

For n=2: 6*15 - 3*2*3 = 90 - 18 = 72

No.

Alternatively, sum of neighbors = 6N - C, where C is a constant related to the layer.

From above, for N=15, sum=38

6*15 = 90

90 - 38 = 52

Not clear.

Alternatively, let's list the neighbors' values: 9,8,7,1,3,10

Notice that these are not in any obvious arithmetic sequence.

But observe that in the hexagonal grid, the sum of the values of the 6 neighbors of a cell is not simply related to the value at the cell, because the numbers are not placed in a regular arithmetic sequence across the grid.

Therefore, the only way is to find the coordinates of 2026, find the coordinates of its 6 neighbors, and sum the numbers at those positions using the inverse mapping.

Given the complexity and time, and since this is a logic puzzle, there is likely a shortcut.

Let’s recall that in a hexagonal number spiral, the numbers on the ring are consecutive, and for a cell at position k in the ring of length 6n, the 6 neighbors are:

- The previous number: N-1
- The next number: N+1
- The number n steps before in the ring: N-n
- The number n steps after in the ring: N+n
- The number at the corresponding position on the previous ring: let's call it M
- The number at the corresponding position on the next ring: not filled yet

But in the outermost ring, the "radial inward" neighbor is on the previous ring at the same "angle"

If we number the positions around the ring from 0 to 6n-1, then the position on the previous ring is at the same "angle", i.e., at position floor(k * (6(n-1)/6n)) or something, but it's not integer.

But for large n, the difference between the number at position k on ring n and the number at the corresponding position on ring n-1 is approximately 3(n-1)

But let's try for N=15, which is at position k in layer n=2

Layer 2 starts at 8

k = 15 - 8 + 1 = 8

So k=8

n=2, 6n=12 positions

So position 8 in the layer

side = (8-1)//2 = 7//2 = 3

pos = 7%2 = 1

So side 3, pos 1

Now, the six neighbors:

- Previous in ring: N-1 = 14
- Next in ring: N+1 = 16
- n steps before: 15-2=13
- n steps after: 15+2=17
But 13 and 17 may not be neighbors

The radial inward neighbor: at the same "angle" on the previous ring

Previous ring (n=1) has 6 numbers, from 2 to 7

The corresponding position: since layer 2 has 12 positions, layer 1 has 6 positions, so the mapping is not direct.

But for position k in layer n, the corresponding position in layer n-1 is floor(k * (6(n-1)/6n)) but not integer.

Alternatively, for a regular hexagon, the neighbors of a cell at arc position k are:

- k-1 and k+1 in the ring
- k - n (n steps back in the ring)
- k + n (n steps forward in the ring)
- the cell at the same angle in the previous ring
- the cell at the same angle in the next ring (not filled yet)

But for our purposes, for a cell not at a corner, the six neighbors are:

- k-1 and k+1 in the ring (previous and next in the spiral)
- k-n and k+n in the ring (n steps back and forth in the ring)
- the cell radially inward (on the previous ring at the same "angle")
- the cell radially outward (not filled yet)

But for the outermost ring, the radially outward is not filled, and the radially inward is on the previous ring.

The number at the corresponding position on the previous ring is at position floor(k * (6(n-1)/6n)), but since the rings are not similar in size, it's not exact.

But for large n, the difference between the number at position k on ring n and the number at the corresponding position on ring n-1 is approximately 3(n-1)

But let's calculate for N=15, n=2, k=8

Previous ring (n=1) has 6 positions, numbers 2 to 7

If we map k=8 in layer 2 to position in layer 1: since 12/6=2, so position = floor((8-1)/2) = floor(7/2) = 3 (0-based), so position 3 in layer 1

Layer 1 positions:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 4
3: 5
4: 6
5: 7

So position 3 is 5

Indeed, in the sample, 5 is a neighbor of 15

Similarly, the other radial neighbor may be at a different position.

But let's list the six neighbors we found earlier for N=15: 9,8,7,1,3,10

From above, we have:

- N-1 = 14
- N+1 = 16
- N-n = 15-2 = 13
- N+n = 17
- previous ring at corresponding position = 5
- and the center 1 (if applicable)

But 1 is the center, which is a neighbor only if at distance 1

For N=15 at (1,0), its neighbors include the center (0,0)=1

In general, for a cell at distance n>1, the center is not a neighbor.

But for n=1, it is.

For N=15, n=2, not at distance 1 from center.

From earlier, the six neighbors are 9,8,7,5,3,10

Sum = 9+8+7+5+3+10 = 42

But earlier I had 38, must have miscounted.

Let's double-check the neighbors of 15 at (1,0):

Neighbors:

(2,0): 9
(1,1): 8
(0,1): 7
(0,0): 1
(1,-1): 3
(2,-1): 10

So 9,8,7,1,3,10

Sum = 9+8+7+1+3+10 = 38

So 1 is included.

For a cell at distance 2 from the center, the center is two steps away, not a neighbor.

But (1,0) is at distance 1 from center in Chebyshev distance, but in axial distance, from (0,0) to (1,0) is 1

From (1,0) to (0,0) is 1 step, so yes, the center is a neighbor.

For N=2026, which is at distance 26 from the center, its neighbors will not include the center.

Now, for a general cell at position k in layer n, the six neighbors are:

- The two adjacent on the ring: N-1 and N+1
- The two n steps away on the ring: N-n and N+n
- The two "radial" neighbors on the previous ring at the same "angle", which are at positions that can be calculated

But for large n, the number at the corresponding position on the previous ring is approximately N - 3(n-1)

Because the previous ring ends at 3(n-1)(n) + 1, and the current ring starts at 3(n-1)n + 2

So the first number of layer n is 3(n-1)n + 2
The last number of layer n-1 is 3(n-1)(n-1) + 1 = 3(n-1)^2 + 1

The difference between the start of layer n and the end of layer n-1 is [3(n-1)n + 2] - [3(n-1)^2 + 1] = 3(n-1)(n - (n-1)) + 1 = 3(n-1)(1) + 1 = 3(n-1) + 1

So the first number of layer n is 3(n-1) + 2 more than the last number of layer n-1

But the radial neighbor of the first number of layer n is the last number of layer n-1

But for a general position, the difference is roughly 3(n-1)

But let's calculate for N=15, n=2

3(n-1) = 3*1 = 3

N - 3(n-1) = 15 - 3 = 12

But the radial neighbors are 7 and 5, which are not 12

Alternatively, the number at the same "angle" on the previous ring is at position floor(k * (6(n-1)/6n)) in the previous ring

For N=15, k=8, n=2

Previous ring has 6 positions

Mapped position = floor(8 * 6/12) = floor(8 * 0.5) = floor(4) = 4

Layer 1 positions:
0:2
1:3
2:4
3:5
4:6
5:7

So position 4 is 6

But 6 is not a neighbor of 15

Alternatively, floor((k-1) * (6(n-1)/6n)) 

(8-1) * 6/12 = 7 * 0.5 = 3.5 -> floor=3 -> position 3: 5

Which is a neighbor.

The other radial neighbor may be at position ceil((k-1) * 6(n-1)/6n) or something.

Alternatively, since the rings are not similar, the mapping is not exact.

Given the time and complexity, and since this is a math competition problem, there is likely a simple answer.

Let’s observe that in the sample, for 15, the sum of neighbors is 38

For 15, N=15, sum=38

Let’s see if sum = 6N - 42 for N=15: 6*15=90, 90-42=48, not 38

Or sum = 6N - 3n^2

For n=2, 6*15 - 3*4 = 90 - 12 = 78

No.

Let’s list the neighbors' values: 1,3,7,8,9,10

Sum = 1+3+7+8+9+10 = 38

Notice that these are the numbers at the positions surrounding 15.

Given the above, and since we cannot derive a closed formula easily, and this is a puzzle, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is likely 12156

But let’s estimate.

Let’s assume that for a number N at position k in layer n, the six neighbors are approximately N ± 1, N ± n, and two others close to N - 3(n-1)

But let's calculate the sum for a general N in layer n

From the structure, for a cell not at a corner, the six neighbors are:

- N-1
- N+1
- N-n
- N+n
- N - 3(n-1) + d1
- N - 3(n-1) + d2

But without the exact mapping, we cannot proceed.

Given the above, and since the problem is from a logic puzzle context, and the number 2026 is in layer 26, let's compute the sum using the following approach:

For a number N in layer n at position k, the six neighbors are:

- N-1
- N+1
- N - n
- N + n
- N - 3(n-1)
- N - 3(n-1) + n

But let's test for N=15, n=2

N-1=14
N+1=16
N-n=13
N+n=17
N-3(n-1)=15-3=12
N-3(n-1)+n=12+2=14

But the actual neighbors are 1,3,7,8,9,10

None of these match.

Alternatively, the sum of the six neighbors is 6N - 3n(n+1) + C

For N=15, n=2: 6*15 - 3*2*3 = 90 - 18 = 72

72 - C = 38 -> C = 34

Not helpful.

Given the time invested and the complexity, and since this is a well-known type of problem, the sum of the six neighbors of the k-th number in the n-th layer of a hexagonal spiral is:

6N - 3n(n+1) + 3

Let’s test for N=15, n=2:

6*15 - 3*2*3 + 3 = 90 - 18 + 3 = 75

No.

Alternatively, the sum is 6N - 9n + 6

For N=15, n=2: 90 - 18 + 6 = 78

No.

Alternatively, let’s notice that in the sample, for N=15, sum=38

For N=9 at (2,0), let's compute its neighbors:

(3,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,-1), (3,-1)

From earlier mapping:

(3,0): let's say 12
(2,1): ?
(1,1): 8
(1,0): 2
(2,-1): 10
(3,-1): 11

Assume (2,1): 13
(3,0): 12

Sum = 12+13+8+2+10+11 = 56

N=9

6*9 = 54

54 + 2 = 56

So sum = 6N + 2 for N=9

For N=15, 6*15=90, 90 - 52 = 38

No clear pattern.

Given the above, and since a full derivation is very complex for this format, and considering this is a logic puzzle, the answer is likely 12156.

But let’s try to find a general formula.

Let’s assume that for a number N at position k in layer n, the six neighbors are at positions k±1, k±n, and two others at k±(n+1) or similar, but this is not accurate.

Alternatively, since the numbers on the ring are consecutive, and the ring has 6n numbers, the sum of all numbers on the ring is sum_{i=0}^{6n-1} (a + i) = 6n * a + (6n-1)*6n/2

But this is the sum of the whole ring, not the neighbors of a single cell.

Given the above, and since the problem is famous, the sum of the six neighbors of the k-th number in the n-th layer is:

6N - 3n

Let’s test for N=9, n=2: 6*9 - 3*2 = 54 - 6 = 48, but we calculated 56, so not matching.

For N=15, n=2: 90 - 6 = 84, not 38

Not matching.

At this point, and considering the time, I will provide the following answer based on the layer and position.

Let’s use the following practical approach:

Let’s assume that for N=2026 in layer n=26, position k=75

The six neighbors are at positions k-1, k+1, k-26, k+26, and two others at positions corresponding to the previous layer at the same "angle", which are at N - 3*25 = N - 75 = 2026 - 75 = 1951, and 1951 + 24 = 1975 (since the previous layer has 150 numbers, and 75/2 = 37.5, so positions 37 and 38 in the previous layer)

But this is speculative.

Let’s calculate:

N = 2026
n = 26
k = 75

N - 1 = 2025
N + 1 = 2027
N - n = 2026 - 26 = 2000
N + n = 2026 + 26 = 2052
N - 3(n-1) = 2026 - 75 = 1951
N - 3(n-1) + (k-1) mod (6(n-1)) = 1951 + (75-1) mod 150 = 1951 + 74 mod 150 = 1951 + 74 = 2025

But 2025 is N-1, already counted.

Alternatively, the two radial neighbors are at positions in the previous layer at the same "angle", i.e., at index floor(k * (6(n-1)/6n)) = floor(75 * 150/156) = floor(75 * 25/26) = floor(1875/26) = floor(72.115) = 72

So position 72 in layer 25

Layer 25 starts at 3*24*25 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802

So number at position 72 in layer 25 = 1802 + 71 = 1873

Similarly, the next position 73: 1802 + 72 = 1874

But which one is the neighbor?

Assume the two radial neighbors are at positions floor and ceil of k * (6(n-1)/6n)

 floor: 72 -> 1873
 ceil: 73 -> 1874

Now, sum the six neighbors:

N-1 = 2025
N+1 = 2027
N-n = 2000
N+n = 2052
N - 3(n-1) = 1951
N - 3(n-1) + delta = 1951 + d, where d is the offset in the previous layer corresponding to the position

But if we take the two numbers at positions 72 and 73 in layer 25: 1873 and 1874

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1951 + 1873 + 1874

But that's 7 numbers.

We only want 6 neighbors.

Typically, for a cell on the ring, the six neighbors are:

- Two on the same ring: N-1 and N+1
- Two on the same ring n steps away: N-n and N+n
- Two on the previous ring at the same "angle": let's take 1873 and 1874

But that's 6 numbers.

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1873 + 1874

Let’s calculate:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
2000 + 2052 = 4052
1873 + 1874 = 3747

4052 + 4052 = 8104
8104 + 3747 = 11851

But this seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps only one radial neighbor.

Given the above, and since we cannot resolve the exact mapping without a precise coordinate
