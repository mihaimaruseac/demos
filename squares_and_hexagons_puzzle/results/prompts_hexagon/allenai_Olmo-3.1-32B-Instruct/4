Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given a hexagonal grid where natural numbers are written in a spiral pattern, starting from 1 at the center. We're shown a small example of the spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

But the pattern isn't immediately clear, so let's try to reconstruct the spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid.

## Step 1: Understand the Hexagonal Grid and Spiral

On a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors (except on the edge). The spiral starts at 1 (center), and numbers increase as you spiral outward.

From the example:

Let’s map the numbers to coordinates. Let's assume 1 is at (0,0).

Let's try to reconstruct the given grid.

We see:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

Let's try to assign coordinates (x, y). In a hex grid, a common coordinate system is axial coordinates (q, r), but for simplicity, let's use offset coordinates for this small example.

Let’s try to place 1 at (0,0). Let's try to map out the numbers:

Let’s suppose the grid is oriented such that moving "right" is +x, and moving "down-right" is +y.

But since the spiral isn't given with full context, let's instead try to deduce the pattern by looking at the numbers around 1.

From the grid, let's try to write out the arrangement:

Let’s suppose the grid is like this (assuming 1 at the center):

Let’s try to list the numbers around 1:

From the grid, 1 is at the center.

Above 1: 5  
Below 1: 7  
Left of 1: 6  
Right of 1: 2  
Above-right of 1: 4  
Below-left of 1: 16? (But 16 is further away)

But the numbers given are:

- 1 at center
- 2 to the right
- 5 above
- 6 to the lower right
- 7 to the right of 6
- 8 to the right of 7
- 9 above 2
- 3 above 4 above 5
- 10 to the right of 3
- 14 to the left of 4
- 15 above 14
- 16 below 15

But let's try to make a coordinate system.

Let’s use axial coordinates (q, r):

Let 1 be at (0,0).

In axial coordinates, the 6 neighbors of (q, r) are:

(q+1, r)
(q, r+1)
(q-1, r+1)
(q-1, r)
(q, r-1)
(q+1, r-1)

Let’s try to assign the numbers around 1:

Let’s suppose the spiral proceeds by moving right, up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right, and so on, expanding outwards in "layers".

But from the given grid, let's try to assign coordinates.

From the sample:

Let’s try to assign coordinates to the numbers shown.

Let’s suppose 1 is at (0,0).

Let’s try to fill in the numbers based on the sample:

From the example, let's try to reconstruct the positions:

Let’s suppose that the grid is as follows (using axial coordinates):

Let’s define the six directions as:

- E (East): (q+1, r)
- NE (North-East): (q, r+1)
- NW (North-West): (q-1, r+1)
- W (West): (q-1, r)
- SW (South-West): (q, r-1)
- SE (South-East): (q+1, r-1)

Let’s try to assign numbers in a spiral, starting at (0,0)=1.

Let’s try the standard hexagonal spiral (sometimes called the "hex numbers" spiral):

- Start at (0,0) = 1
- Move E to (1,0) = 2
- Move NE to (1,1) = 3
- Move NW to (0,1) = 4
- Move NW to (-1,1) = 5
- Move W to (-1,0) = 6
- Move W to (-2,0) = 7
- Move SW to (-2,-1) = 8
- Move SE to (-1,-1) = 9
- Move SE to (0,-1) = 10
- Move E to (1,-1) = 11
- Move E to (2,-1) = 12
- Move NE to (2,0) = 13
- Move NE to (2,1) = 14
- Move E to (3,1) = 15
- Move E to (4,1) = 16
But this doesn't exactly match the sample.

Alternatively, let's try to map the numbers given in the sample to coordinates.

From the sample:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

Let’s try to align them.

Let’s suppose the center is at (0,0):

Let’s try:

(0,0): 1

Let’s try to fill in the surrounding numbers based on the sample:

Let’s try to assign:

Let’s suppose that 1 is at (0,0)

To the right is 2: (1,0)

Above is 5: (0,1)

Below is 6: (0,-1)? But in the sample 6 is below and right of 5.

But in the sample, above 1 is 5, to the right of 1 is 2, to the lower right is 6, to the right of 6 is 7, to the right of 7 is 8.

Let’s try to map:

Let’s suppose the coordinates are as follows:

Let’s define the grid as follows (using offset coordinates for clarity):

Let’s let (0,0) = 1

Let’s define the 6 neighbors as:

(1,0) = right = 2

(0,1) = up = 5

(1,1) = up-right = 4

(-1,1) = up-left = 15

(-1,0) = left = 6

(0,-1) = down = 7

But in the sample, below 1 is 6, but in the sample, below 1 is 6, but in the sample, 6 is to the lower right of 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are arranged as follows:

Let’s try to reconstruct the grid row by row, aligning the given numbers.

Let’s try to lay out the sample as a grid of coordinates.

Let’s suppose we have a coordinate grid where x increases to the right, and y increases upwards.

Let’s try:

Let’s assign 1 at (0,0).

From the sample:

Row 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
Row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
Row 3: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Let’s try to write this out as:

Let’s suppose that each '...' is an empty space.

Let’s align the numbers by columns.

Let’s try to write the grid with coordinates:

Let’s suppose that 1 is at (0,0).

Looking at the center row: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

So let's say 15 is at (-2,0), 5 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 9 at (2,0)

But above that: ... 14 4 3 10 ...

So above 15 is 14 at (-2,1), above 5 is 4 at (-1,1), above 1 is 3 at (0,1), above 2 is ? at (1,1), above 9 is 10 at (2,1)

But in the sample it's "... 14 4 3 10 ..." so probably 14 at (-3,1), 4 at (-2,1), 3 at (-1,1), 10 at (0,1)

But let's try to align properly.

Let’s try to write out the grid with (x, y) coordinates:

Let’s let the center row be y=0, and center x=0.

So:

y = 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
y = 0: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
y = -1: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Let’s assign positions:

For y=0 (center row):

Positions: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] in x

But there are 5 numbers: 15 at x=-2, 5 at x=-1, 1 at x=0, 2 at x=1, 9 at x=2

So 15 at (-2,0), 5 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 9 at (2,0)

For y=1 (above):

Numbers: 14, 4, 3, 10

Let’s suppose they are at x = -3, -2, -1, 0

So 14 at (-3,1), 4 at (-2,1), 3 at (-1,1), 10 at (0,1)

For y=-1 (below):

Numbers: 16, 6, 7, 8

Let’s suppose at x = -2, -1, 0, 1

16 at (-2,-1), 6 at (-1,-1), 7 at (0,-1), 8 at (1,-1)

Now let's fill in the neighbors of 1 at (0,0):

Neighbors in a square grid would be (±1,0), (0,±1), but in a hex grid, there are 6 directions.

But in this offset grid, the 6 neighbors of (0,0) are:

- (1,0): 2
- (-1,0): 5
- (0,1): 3
- (0,-1): 7
- (1,-1): 9 (but that's diagonally down-right in this offset)
Wait, let's check the actual neighbors.

But in a hex grid with this offset, the neighbors of (0,0) are:

- (1,0): right
- (0,1): up
- (-1,1): up-left
- (-1,0): left
- (0,-1): down
- (1,-1): down-right

But let's see which of these positions are filled in our grid.

From above:

(1,0): 2
(-1,0): 5
(0,1): 3
(0,-1): 7
(-1,1): from above, at (-1,1) we have 4
(1,-1): at (1,-1) we have not assigned, but from above, at y=-1, x=1 we have 8

Wait, let's list all positions:

From y=1:
(-3,1): 14
(-2,1): 4
(-1,1): 3
(0,1): 10

From y=0:
(-2,0): 15
(-1,0): 5
(0,0): 1
(1,0): 2
(2,0): 9

From y=-1:
(-2,-1): 16
(-1,-1): 6
(0,-1): 7
(1,-1): 8

Now, the neighbors of (0,0):

Let’s list the 6 neighbors:

1. (1,0): 2
2. (0,1): 3
3. (-1,1): 4
4. (-1,0): 5
5. (0,-1): 7
6. (1,-1): 8

So the 6 neighbors of 1 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Let’s check the sample: Yes, that's consistent with the arrangement.

Therefore, in this coordinate system, the 6 neighbors of a cell (q,r) are:

(q+1, r)
(q, r+1)
(q-1, r+1)
(q-1, r)
(q, r-1)
(q+1, r-1)

So the mapping is:

(q+1, r): right
(q, r+1): up
(q-1, r+1): up-left
(q-1, r): left
(q, r-1): down
(q+1, r-1): down-right

Now we need to figure out the position of 2026 in this spiral, and then find its 6 neighbors and sum them.

But first, we need to determine the mapping from number to coordinates.

## Step 2: Find the Pattern for Number to Coordinates

Let’s try to find a formula for the number at each coordinate.

Let’s list the numbers at each coordinate from the above grid:

Let’s create a table:

| x | y | num |
|---|---|-----|
| -3 | 1 | 14 |
| -2 | 1 | 4  |
| -1 | 1 | 3  |
| 0  | 1 | 10 |
| -2 | 0 | 15 |
| -1 | 0 | 5  |
| 0  | 0 | 1  |
| 1  | 0 | 2  |
| 2  | 0 | 9  |
| -2 | -1| 16 |
| -1 | -1| 6  |
| 0  | -1| 7  |
| 1  | -1| 8  |

Now let's try to see the order in which the numbers are placed.

Let’s try to trace the spiral starting from 1.

Start at (0,0) = 1

Let’s try to see the path:

From 1, the numbers increase as we move in a spiral.

Let’s try to reconstruct the order:

Let’s see the numbers around 1:

2 at (1,0)
3 at (0,1)
4 at (-2,1)
5 at (-1,0)
6 at (-1,-1)
7 at (0,-1)
8 at (1,-1)
9 at (2,0)
10 at (0,1)? But 10 is at (0,1), but that's where 3 is? Wait above we have 3 at (-1,1), 10 at (0,1)

Wait, let's double-check the coordinates for 3 and 10.

Earlier, I assigned:

(-1,1): 3
(0,1): 10

But in the sample, above 5 is 4, above 1 is 3, above 2 is blank, above 9 is 10.

So above 1 is 3 at (0,1), above 2 is (1,1), which is not filled in the sample, above 9 is (2,1): 10

So perhaps my mapping is off by one in x for the upper row.

Let’s try shifting:

Let’s suppose that for y=1, the x coordinates are offset by +1 compared to y=0.

That is, for y=0: x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
for y=1: x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1
for y=-1: x = -2, -1, 0, 1

But in the sample, above 15 at (-2,0) is 14 at (-3,1), above 5 at (-1,0) is 4 at (-2,1), above 1 at (0,0) is 3 at (-1,1), above 2 at (1,0) is (0,1), above 9 at (2,0) is 10 at (1,1)

So the x coordinate for y=1 is x = x' - 1, where x' is the x coordinate in the row below.

Let’s try:

Let’s define for each y, x runs from x_min(y) to x_max(y).

But perhaps it's easier to see the layers.

Let’s see the "rings" around the center.

Let’s define "layer" n as the set of points with max(|x|, |y|, |x+y|) = n.

But perhaps let's try to see how the numbers increase.

Let’s list the numbers in order of increasing distance from the center:

Center:
(0,0): 1

Layer 1 (distance 1):

Let’s list neighbors of (0,0):

From above: (1,0):2, (-1,0):5, (0,1):3, (0,-1):7, (-1,1):4, (1,-1):8

So numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8

But in what order are they filled?

From the sample:

1 at (0,0)

Then 2 at (1,0)
Then 3 at (0,1)
Then 4 at (-1,1)
Then 5 at (-1,0)
Then 6 at (-2,0)? But in our grid above, 6 is at (-1,-1)
Wait, in the grid above, 6 is at (-1,-1)

Wait, let's try to trace the spiral path.

Let’s try to reconstruct the spiral step by step.

Let’s start at (0,0) = 1

Now, let's move in the spiral order, as typically done in hexagonal number spirals.

But let's see the sample's arrangement.

From 1, moving right to (1,0) = 2

Then up-right to (1,1)? But in our grid, (1,1) is not filled yet. Instead, above 1 is (0,1)=3

So let's try:

From (0,0)=1

Move right to (1,0)=2

Then up to (1,1)? But in our mapping, above (1,0) would be (1,1), but in the sample above 2 is blank, above 1 is 3 at (0,1)

Alternatively, let's try moving up first.

But in the sample, above 1 is 3, so let's try:

From (0,0)=1

Move up to (0,1)=3

Then up-left to (-1,1)=4

Then up-left to (-2,1)=14? But 14 is further out.

Alternatively, let's try a different approach.

Let’s try to list all numbers up to 16 with their coordinates, and see the pattern.

From the mapping above:

(0,0): 1

(1,0): 2

(-1,0): 5

(0,1): 3

(-1,1): 4

(0,-1): 7

(1,-1): 8

(-2,0): 15

(-1,-1): 6

(2,0): 9

(1,1): ? (not assigned yet)

(0,2): ?

(-2,1): 14

(-3,1): 14? Wait above we had (-3,1):14

Wait, in our earlier mapping, (-3,1):14, (-2,1):4, (-1,1):3, (0,1):10

But that can't be, because 3 and 4 are both supposed to be close to 1.

Wait, I think my earlier coordinate mapping was off.

Let me try to reconstruct the spiral properly.

Let’s use a standard hexagonal spiral generation algorithm.

One standard way to generate a hexagonal spiral is as follows:

- Start at (0,0) = 1
- The spiral grows in "rings". Each ring k (k >= 1) is a hexagon at distance k from the center.
- Each ring has 6k cells.

But let's instead try to generate the numbers and coordinates step by step for the first few layers, matching the sample.

Let’s define the six directions in order for the spiral:

Let’s use these directions in order (clockwise or counter-clockwise):

Let’s pick the order: right, up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right

But let's try the order as per the sample:

From 1, the next numbers seem to go:

1 → 2 (right)
2 → 9 (down-right?)
But in the sample, to the right of 1 is 2, above 1 is 5, above 5 is 4, above 4 is 14, left of 1 is 6, below 1 is 7

But let's try the following order of directions (starting at (0,0)):

Let’s define the 6 directions as vectors:

Let’s use axial coordinates (q, r)

Directions (in this order):

1. (1, 0)   # right
2. (0, 1)   # up
3. (-1, 1)  # up-left
4. (-1, 0)  # left
5. (0, -1)  # down
6. (1, -1)  # down-right

And we proceed in layers: for layer n=1, we take 1 step in each direction; for n=2, 2 steps in each direction, etc.

But in a hexagonal spiral, each "ring" n (n >= 1) consists of 6n cells, starting from the previous ring's end and moving in the directions above, each for n steps.

But let's try to generate the coordinates and numbers step by step.

Let’s define:

Let’s let (q, r) = (0,0) for n=0

Let’s let dir = [ (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) ]

Let’s let steps_per_ring = 1 for the first ring, 2 for the second, etc.

But actually, in a hexagonal spiral, the number of steps in each direction increases by 1 every two direction changes after the first ring.

But for small numbers, let's just try to match the sample.

Alternatively, let's try to see the distance from the center for each number in the sample:

Let’s compute for each coordinate the "layer":

For (0,0): layer 0

For (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1): layer 1

For (-2,0), (-1,-1), (2,0), (-2,1), (1,1): layer 2

But in our mapping above, we have numbers up to 16.

Alternatively, let's try to generate the spiral step by step using the following algorithm (from known hexagonal number generation):

From https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HexagonalNumber.html and OEIS A003215, but that's for hexagonal numbers (centered at 1, then 7, 19, ...), but here it's a spiral.

Alternatively, let's try to use the approach from https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial

But perhaps the easiest is to notice that in the given sample, the numbers increase in a spiral, and the neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 but in our mapping above, the neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8.

But in the sample, 6 is not a neighbor of 1, but rather neighbor of 5 and 7.

From the coordinates:

Neighbors of (0,0):

(1,0): 2

(0,1): 3

(-1,1): 4

(-1,0): 5

(0,-1): 7

(1,-1): 8

So the 6 neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8

Let’s check their sum: 2+3+4+5+7+8 = 29

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Now, to find the 6 neighbors of 2026, we need to know its coordinates, then get the coordinates of its 6 neighbors, and sum the numbers at those positions.

So we need a mapping from number to coordinates.

Let’s try to deduce the pattern.

Let’s try to continue the spiral beyond the given numbers to see the pattern.

Let’s try to generate the next numbers and their coordinates.

Let’s try to continue from where we left off.

From the sample, the last assigned number is 16 at (-2,-1)

Let’s continue the spiral.

Let’s try to see the path:

Let’s try to follow the spiral as it would be generated.

Let’s define the movement directions in order:

Let’s try the following order (based on the sample):

From 1 at (0,0):

Move right to (1,0)=2

Move up to (1,1)? But in the sample, above 2 is blank, above 1 is 3 at (0,1)

Alternatively, let's try this movement:

Let’s define the directions as:

0: right     (q+1, r)
1: up-right  (q, r+1)
2: up-left   (q-1, r+1)
3: left      (q-1, r)
4: down-left (q, r-1)
5: down-right(q+1, r-1)

And for each layer k >= 1, we take k steps in direction 0, k steps in direction 1, k steps in direction 2, k steps in direction 3, k steps in direction 4, k steps in direction 5, then increase k by 1 and repeat.

But in a hexagonal spiral, usually after the center, you go:

- 1 step right
- 1 step up-right
- 1 step up-left
- 1 step left
- 1 step down-left
- 1 step down-right
Then 2 steps right, 2 steps up-right, etc.

But let's try this for the first few steps.

Let’s start at (0,0)=1

Let k=1:

- right: (1,0)=2
- up-right: (1,1)=3
- up-left: (0,1)=4
- left: (-1,1)=5
- down-left: (-1,0)=6
- down-right: (0,0) but that's already taken, so (0,-1)=7

Wait, but (0,-1) is down from (0,0)

But let's try:

Start at (0,0)=1

Move right: (1,0)=2

Move up-right: (1,1)=3

Move up-left: (0,1)=4

Move left: (-1,1)=5

Move down-left: (-1,0)=6

Move down-right: (0,0) is taken, so move to (0,-1)=7

Now, k=2:

- right: (1,-1)=8
- up-right: (1,0) is taken, so (1,1) is taken, so next is (2,1)=9
Wait, but up-right from (0,-1) is (0,0), taken, so perhaps from last position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to always move from the last position.

Let’s track the path step by step, keeping track of the current position and the direction index.

Let’s define directions as vectors:

dirs = [
    (1, 0),  # right
    (0, 1),  # up
    (-1, 1), # up-left
    (-1, 0), # left
    (0, -1), # down
    (1, -1)  # down-right
]

Let’s start at (0,0), number=1

Let’s keep a variable dir_idx=0

Let’s keep a layer k=1

For each layer k, we do 6 steps, but after each pair of directions, we increment the step size? Or for each direction, we take k steps.

Let’s try the standard approach:

For n = 1 to infinity:
    for i = 0 to 5:
        for j = 1 to n:
            move in direction dirs[i]
            place next number

But let's try for small n:

n=1:

dir 0 (right): step 1: (1,0)=2
dir 1 (up): step 1: (1,1)=3
dir 2 (up-left): step 1: (0,1)=4
dir 3 (left): step 1: (-1,1)=5
dir 4 (down): step 1: (-1,0)=6
dir 5 (down-right): step 1: (0,-1)=7

Now at (0,-1), number=7

n=2:

dir 0 (right): step 1: (1,-1)=8
           step 2: (2,-1)=9
dir 1 (up): step 1: (2,0)=10
           step 2: (2,1)=11
dir 2 (up-left): step 1: (1,1)= already filled (was 3), so perhaps we start from current position (2,1)
But (2,1) + (-1,1) = (1,2)=12
           step 2: (0,2)=13
dir 3 (left): step 1: (-1,2)=14
           step 2: (-2,2)=15
dir 4 (down): step 1: (-2,1)=16
           step 2: (-2,0)=17
dir 5 (down-right): step 1: (-1,-1)=18
           step 2: (0,-2)=19

But this is getting messy and may not match the sample.

Alternatively, let's try to match the sample by hand.

From the sample grid:

Let’s try to write out the numbers and their coordinates as per the sample layout.

Let’s reproduce the sample as best as possible, using the following coordinate system:

Let’s let the center be at (0,0) = 1

To the right: (1,0) = 2

To the left: (-1,0) = 6

Above: (0,1) = 5

Above right: (1,1) = ? (not shown)

Above left: (-1,1) = 4

Below: (0,-1) = 7

Below right: (1,-1) = 8

Below left: (-1,-1) = ?

Left of 6: (-2,0) = 15

Left of 4: (-2,1) = 14

Above 5: (0,1)=5, above that is (-1,1)=4, above that is (-2,1)=14

Right of 2: (2,0)=9

Above 9: (2,1)=10

Left of 9: (1,-1)=8

But in the sample:

Row y=1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...
But in our mapping, ( -2,1)=14, (-1,1)=4, (0,1)=?, (1,1)=?

But above 1 is (0,1), which in the sample is 3

So (0,1)=3

Then above 2 is (1,1), which in the sample above 2 is blank, above 9 is 10 at (2,1)

So (2,1)=10

Similarly, below 1 is (0,-1)=7

Below 6 is (-1,-1), which is not in the sample

Below 7 is (0,-2), not in the sample

Now, let's try to fill in the coordinates for numbers 1 to 16:

Let’s try to list all numbers and their coordinates based on the sample and logical extension:

( -2, 1): 14
( -1, 1): 4
( 0, 1): 3
( 1, 1): ? (let's call it x)
( 2, 1): 10

( -2, 0): 15
( -1, 0): 5
( 0, 0): 1
( 1, 0): 2
( 2, 0): 9

( -2, -1): ?
( -1, -1): 6
( 0, -1): 7
( 1, -1): 8
( 2, -1): ?

Now, from the sample, the only missing numbers in 1..16 are 11,12,13,16

Let’s try to fill in the missing ones.

From the spiral, after 10 at (2,1), the next would be moving left along y=1:

From (2,1)=10, move left to (1,1)=11, then to (0,1)= already 3, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, after 10 at (2,1), move down to (2,0)=9 (already filled), then to (2,-1)=11

Let’s try to continue the spiral from 9 at (2,0):

From (2,0)=9

Move down-right to (3,-1)? But let's try to see a path.

Alternatively, let's try to see the order of filling.

From 1 at (0,0)

Go right to (1,0)=2

Go up to (1,1)=3

Go left to (0,1)=4

Go left to (-1,1)=5

But in the sample, (0,1)=3, (-1,1)=4

So perhaps:

(0,0)=1

(1,0)=2

(1,1)=3

(0,1)=4

(-1,1)=5

(-1,0)=6

(-1,-1)=7

(0,-1)=8

(1,-1)=9

(2,-1)=10

(2,0)=11

(2,1)=12

(1,1) is already 3, so (0,1) is 4, (-1,1) is 5

Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, let's use the mapping from the sample and extend it systematically.

Let’s accept that the mapping in the sample is as follows (from earlier):

(-3,1): 14
(-2,1): 4
(-1,1): 3
(0,1): 10
(-2,0): 15
(-1,0): 5
(0,0): 1
(1,0): 2
(2,0): 9
(-2,-1): 16
(-1,-1): 6
(0,-1): 7
(1,-1): 8

But this can't be, because 3 and 4 are not both above 5.

Let’s instead trust the earlier neighbor mapping for 1:

Neighbors of 1 at (0,0) are:

(1,0)=2
(-1,0)=5
(0,1)=3
(0,-1)=7
(-1,1)=4
(1,-1)=8

So let's use this as the basis.

So let's define the mapping for the first ring:

Let’s define the order in which the numbers are placed around the center:

Let’s suppose the order is:

1 at (0,0)

Then moving in the following order around the center:

(1,0)=2
(0,1)=3
(-1,1)=4
(-1,0)=5
(-1,-1)=6
(0,-1)=7
(1,-1)=8
(2,-1)=9
(2,0)=10
(2,1)=11
(1,1)=12
(0,2)=13
(-1,2)=14
(-2,1)=15
(-2,0)=16
...

But this is speculative.

But from the sample, we have:

(0,1)=3
(-1,1)=4
(-2,1)=14
(-2,0)=15
(-1,0)=5
(0,0)=1
(1,0)=2
(2,0)=9
(1,-1)=8
(0,-1)=7
(-1,-1)=6
(-2,-1)= not in sample

And above 9 is 10 at (2,1)

So let's try to continue from 9 at (2,0):

From (2,0)=9

Move up to (2,1)=10

Then left to (1,1)=11

Then left to (0,1)= already 3, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, after 9 at (2,0), move up-right to (3,1)? But let's try to see the pattern of the first ring.

Let’s list the numbers in the order they are placed, using the neighbor mapping.

Let’s define that from 1 at (0,0), we move in the following order of directions for the first ring:

Let’s use the 6 neighbors in this order:

(1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)

But we have 6 neighbors, so perhaps in this order:

Let’s number the directions as:

0: (1,0)
1: (0,1)
2: (-1,1)
3: (-1,0)
4: (-1,-1)
5: (0,-1)
6: (1,-1)

But for a hexagon, only 6 neighbors.

Let’s try this order for the first ring:

Start at (0,0)=1

1. (1,0)=2
2. (0,1)=3
3. (-1,1)=4
4. (-1,0)=5
5. (-1,-1)=6
6. (0,-1)=7
7. (1,-1)=8

Then the next layer starts by moving further in the right direction:

From (1,-1)=8, move right to (2,-1)=9

Then up to (2,0)=10

Then up to (2,1)=11

Then left to (1,1)=12

Then left to (0,1)= already filled

Alternatively, let's try to see the actual distances.

Let’s compute for each coordinate the maximum of |x|, |y|, |x+y| (which gives the "layer" or "ring" number).

For (0,0): layer 0

For (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1): layer 1

For (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2): layer 2

But let's assign numbers in order of increasing layer, and within each layer, in some order.

But perhaps it's easier to notice that the numbers on the same layer can be calculated.

Alternatively, let's notice that in a hexagonal spiral, the numbers on the corners of each layer can be given by a formula.

But perhaps let's use the following approach:

Let’s observe that the numbers at the "corners" of each layer increase in arithmetic progressions.

But given the time, perhaps the best is to derive a formula for the number at each coordinate by observing the pattern in the small numbers.

Let’s list the coordinates and numbers we have:

(0,0): 1

(1,0): 2
(0,1): 3
(-1,1): 4
(-1,0): 5
(-1,-1): 6
(0,-1): 7
(1,-1): 8
(2,-1): 9
(2,0): 10
(2,1): 11
(1,1): 12
(0,2): 13
(-1,2): 14
(-2,1): 15
(-2,0): 16

Now let's check if this matches the sample.

From this, let's see the sample grid:

At y=1:
x=-2: (-2,1): not assigned yet
x=-1: (-1,1): 4
x=0: (0,1): 3
x=1: (1,1): 12
x=2: (2,1): 11

But in the sample, row y=1 is ... 14 4 3 10 ...

So at x=-3: 14
x=-2: 4
x=-1: 3
x=0: 10

But in our mapping, (-3,1) is not assigned, (-2,1) is not assigned in the above, (-1,1)=4, (0,1)=3, (1,1)=12

But in the sample, (-2,1)=14, (-1,1)=4, (0,1)=3, (1,1)=10

So let's try to shift.

Let’s try to define that for each y, x runs from x_min to x_max, and the numbers increase as we go around.

Alternatively, let’s notice that the numbers at (x, y) for y >= 0 are filled before y < 0.

But perhaps let's try to find a formula.

Let’s see if there's a pattern in the numbers along rays from the origin.

Let’s try the ray x + y = c

Or let's try to see the numbers along x=0:

(0,0)=1
(0,1)=3
(0,-1)=7
(0,2)=?
(0,-2)=?

Along x=1:

(1,0)=2
(1,1)=?
(1,-1)=8
(1,2)=?
(1,-2)=?

But from above, (1,1)=12

But in the sample, above 2 is blank, so perhaps (1,1) is not filled until later.

Given the complexity and time, perhaps the best is to use a known hexagonal spiral coordinate system and number assignment.

According to this resource: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial

One way to generate a hexagonal spiral is:

Let’s define the steps as layers. For each layer k >= 1, the numbers on that layer start from:

start_k = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 1 + 6 * k * (k-1) / 2 = 1 + 3k(k-1)

For k=1: start_1 = 1

Numbers on layer k are from start_k to start_{k+1}-1

The 6 corners of layer k are at:

(q, r) = (k, 0)
(q, r) = (k-1, k)
(q, r) = (-k+1, k)
(q, r) = (-k, 0)
(q, r) = (-k+1, -k)
(q, r) = (k-1, -k)

And the numbers at these corners are:

Let’s compute for k=1:

start_1 = 1

Corners:
(1,0)
(0,1)
(-1,1)
(-1,0)
(-1,-1)
(0,-1)

Numbers assigned in order:

(1,0)=1
(0,1)=2
(-1,1)=3
(-1,0)=4
(-1,-1)=5
(0,-1)=6

But in our sample, (1,0)=2, (0,1)=3, (-1,1)=4, (-1,0)=5, (-1,-1)=6, (0,-1)=7

So perhaps the starting number for layer k is 1 + 3(k-1)k

For k=1: 1
For k=2: 1 + 3*2*1 = 7
For k=3: 1 + 3*3*2 = 19

But our numbers don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the number at (q,r) can be calculated by the formula for hexagonal numbers, but offset.

But perhaps let's try a different approach.

Let’s notice that the sum we are to compute is for a large number, 2026, so we need a general method.

Let’s observe that in a hexagonal spiral, the numbers at distance d from the center are arranged in a ring of 6d cells.

The first ring (d=1) has 6 numbers: 2 through 7

The second ring (d=2) has 12 numbers: 8 through 19

The third ring (d=3) has 18 numbers: 20 through 37

In general, ring d has 6d numbers, and starts at:

start(d) = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + (d-1)) + 1 = 1 + 6 * d*(d-1)/2 + 1 = 1 + 3d(d-1) + 1 = 2 + 3d(d-1)

Let’s check:

d=1: 2 + 3*1*0 = 2, but ring 1 should start at 2

But the center is 1, then ring 1 starts at 2

So start(d) = 1 + 3d(d-1) + 1 = 2 + 3d(d-1)

But for d=1: 2 + 0 = 2

For d=2: 2 + 3*2*1 = 2 + 6 = 8

For d=3: 2 + 3*3*2 = 2 + 18 = 20

Yes, matches: ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers), ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers), ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)

So in general, ring d contains numbers from N_start = 2 + 3d(d-1) to N_end = 2 + 3d(d-1) + 6d - 1 = 1 + 3d^2 + 3d

Now, to find the coordinates of number 2026, we need to find which ring it's in.

Let’s solve for d such that N_start(d) <= 2026 <= N_end(d)

N_end(d) = 1 + 3d^2 + 3d

Let’s solve 1 + 3d^2 + 3d >= 2026

3d^2 + 3d + 1 >= 2026

3d^2 + 3d - 2025 >= 0

d^2 + d - 675 >= 0

Solve d^2 + d - 675 = 0

d = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2704) = 52, sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97

So d ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.48

So d = 26 is the first integer where N_end(26) >= 2026

Let’s compute N_end(25):

N_end(25) = 1 + 3*25^2 + 3*25 = 1 + 3*625 + 75 = 1 + 1875 + 75 = 1951

N_start(26) = 2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 3*650 = 2 + 1950 = 1952

N_end(26) = 1 + 3*26^2 + 3*26 = 1 + 3*676 + 78 = 1 + 2028 + 78 = 2107

So ring 26 contains numbers from 1952 to 2107

2026 is in ring 26

The offset within the ring is 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75th number in ring 26 (since 1952 is the first)

But let's check: 1952 is the first, so 1952 + k - 1 = 2026, so k = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75

So 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26

Each ring has 6 * 26 = 156 numbers

The ring is divided into 6 sides of 26 numbers each

So each side has 26 numbers

The sides are, in order (let's use the standard directions):

Let’s define the 6 directions (as vectors in axial coordinates):

Let’s use the following order (starting from (d,0) and going counter-clockwise):

Let’s use the directions as per Red Blob Games:

dir0: (1,0)
dir1: (0,1)
dir2: (-1,1)
dir3: (-1,0)
dir4: (-1,-1)
dir5: (0,-1)

But for a ring of distance d, the corners are at:

( d, 0 )
( d-1, 1 )
( -d+1, 1 )
( -d, 0 )
( -d+1, -1 )
( 0, -d )

But to parameterize the spiral, we can say:

For side s = 0 to 5, and step t = 0 to d-1

The position for side s and step t is:

Let’s use the method from here: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#distance-rings

But for our purpose, let's define the starting point of the ring as (d, 0)

Then we move in direction dir1 for d steps, then dir2 for d steps, etc.

But let's define it precisely.

Let’s define the 6 directions in order (let’s use the order as in the sample spiral):

Let’s suppose the order is:

0: right   (q+1, r)
1: up-right (q, r+1)
2: up-left  (q-1, r+1)
3: left     (q-1, r)
4: down-left(q, r-1)
5: down-right(q+1, r-1)

But let's align with the sample.

From the center, the first move is to the right: (1,0)=2

Then up-right: (1,1)=3

Then up-left: (0,1)=4

Then up-left again: (-1,1)=5

But in our earlier neighbor mapping, (0,1)=3, (-1,1)=4

Let’s instead use the following order, matching the sample's apparent spiral:

From (0,0)=1

Move right: (1,0)=2

Move up: (1,1)=3

Move left: (0,1)=4

Move left: (-1,1)=5

Move down-left: (-1,0)=6

Move down: (-1,-1)=7

Move right-down: (0,-1)=8

Move right: (1,-1)=9

Move right: (2,-1)=10

Move up-right: (2,0)=11

Move up-right: (2,1)=12

Move left-up: (1,1)= already filled

But this is not systematic.

Given the time constraints, and since this is a math puzzle, perhaps there's a pattern in the sum of the 6 neighbors.

In a hexagonal spiral, for any cell not on the edge, the sum of the 6 neighbors can be related to the number itself and the layer.

But in a regular hexagonal grid with numbers increasing in a spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is not simply related, but perhaps for this specific spiral, there is a pattern.

But let’s try to compute the sum of the 6 neighbors for a few small n and look for a pattern.

From earlier, for n=1 at (0,0), the 6 neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8. Sum = 2+3+4+5+7+8 = 29

For n=2 at (1,0), the neighbors are:

(2,0)=?
(1,1)=?
(0,1)=3
(0,0)=1
(1,-1)=8
(2,-1)=9

But we don't have (2,0) and (1,1) yet in our small mapping.

But from our earlier attempt:

(1,0)=2

Neighbors:

(2,0)=10 (from above)
(1,1)= let's say 12
(0,1)=3
(0,0)=1
(1,-1)=8
(2,-1)=9

But let's use the coordinate mapping we had earlier for small numbers:

From earlier mapping:

(0,0)=1
(1,0)=2
(0,1)=3
(-1,1)=4
(-1,0)=5
(-1,-1)=6
(0,-1)=7
(1,-1)=8
(2,-1)=9
(2,0)=10
(2,1)=11
(1,1)=12
(0,2)=13
(-1,2)=14
(-2,1)=15
(-2,0)=16

Now, let's get the neighbors of 2 at (1,0):

Neighbors:

(2,0)=10
(1,1)=12
(0,1)=3
(0,0)=1
(1,-1)=8
(2,-1)=9

Sum = 10+12+3+1+8+9 = 43

Now for 3 at (0,1):

Neighbors:

(1,1)=12
(0,2)=13
(-1,2)=14
(-1,1)=4
(0,0)=1
(-1,0)=5

Sum = 12+13+14+4+1+5 = 49

For 4 at (-1,1):

Neighbors:

(0,1)=3
(-1,2)=14
(-2,2)= not assigned
(-2,1)=15
(-1,0)=5
(-2,0)=16

But (-2,2) is not assigned yet.

But let's assume the pattern continues similarly.

But perhaps there's a better approach.

Let’s notice that in such spirals, for a number n at position (q,r), the 6 neighbors are at (q±1, r), (q, r±1), (q±1, r∓1), and their values depend on the mapping.

But unless we have the explicit formula for number to coordinates, we can't directly compute.

But perhaps we can find a general formula.

Let’s observe the mapping from (q,r) to n.

Let’s observe from the earlier list:

Let’s list (q,r) and n:

(0,0): 1
(1,0): 2
(0,1): 3
(-1,1): 4
(-1,0): 5
(-1,-1): 6
(0,-1): 7
(1,-1): 8
(2,-1): 9
(2,0): 10
(2,1): 11
(1,1): 12
(0,2): 13
(-1,2): 14
(-2,1): 15
(-2,0): 16

Let’s see if there's a formula.

Let’s try for points with r >= 0 and r <= 0 separately.

Let’s try to see for points on the same "diagonal".

Let’s try to see if n can be expressed as a function of q and r.

Let’s try for r >= 0:

For (q, r), with r >= 0

For r=0:
(0,0):1
(1,0):2
(2,0):10
(-1,0):5
(-2,0):16

For r=1:
(0,1):3
(1,1):12
(2,1):11
(-1,1):4
(-2,1):15

For r=2:
(0,2):13
(-1,2):14

Let’s see if there's a pattern.

Let’s try to see for (q, r), q >= -r

Let’s try for each r, the q values go from -r to some max_q(r)

For r=0: q from -2 to 2 in our list

But let's see the numbers increase as we go around.

Alternatively, let's try to find a formula by observing the numbers at the "corners" of each layer.

For layer d=1 (ring 1):

Corners at:
(1,0)=2
(0,1)=3
(-1,1)=4
(-1,0)=5
(-1,-1)=6
(0,-1)=7

For d=2:

(2,0)=10
(1,1)=12
(0,2)=13
(-1,2)=14
(-2,1)=15
(-2,0)=16
(-2,-1)=?
(-1,-1)=6 (already assigned)
(0,-2)=?
(1,-2)=?
(2,-1)=9
(2,-2)=?

But from our list, for d=2, we have:

(2,0)=10
(1,1)=12
(0,2)=13
(-1,2)=14
(-2,1)=15
(-2,0)=16
(-2,-1)= not assigned
(-1,-1)=6
(0,-2)= not assigned
(1,-2)= not assigned
(2,-1)=9
(2,-2)= not assigned

But in our earlier listing, (2,-1)=9

Let’s try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers at (d,0):

(1,0)=2
(2,0)=10
Let’s see the difference: 10 - 2 = 8

(3,0)=? Let's extrapolate

From the increments, let's see the numbers at (d,0):

d=1: (1,0)=2
d=2: (2,0)=10
d=3: let's guess

From 2 to 10 is +8

From the ring sizes, the last number of ring d is 1 + 3d^2 + 3d

For d=1: 1 + 3*1 + 3*1 = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7
For d=2: 1 + 3*4 + 6 = 1 + 12 + 6 = 19
For d=3: 1 + 3*9 + 9 = 1 + 27 + 9 = 37

So (3,0) would be the first number of ring 3? No, the first number of ring 3 is 20

But (3,0) would be further out.

But perhaps (d,0) = 1 + 3(d-1)^2 + 3(d-1) + d

For d=1: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2
For d=2: 1 + 3*1 + 3*1 + 2 = 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 9, but (2,0)=10

Alternatively, perhaps (d,0) = 3d^2 - 3d + 2

For d=1: 3 - 3 + 2 = 2
For d=2: 12 - 6 + 2 = 8, but (2,0)=10

Alternatively, let's list the numbers at (d,0):

d=1: (1,0)=2
d=2: (2,0)=10
d=3: let's see the next in the pattern

From 2 to 10 is +8

From ring 1 to ring 2, the increment from (1,0) to (2,0) is 8

From ring 2 to ring 3, let's see what (3,0) would be.

From the earlier list, after 16 at (-2,0), the next would be (-3,0)=17? But not in our list.

But let's see the numbers assigned in order around the spiral.

Given the complexity and time, and since this is a math puzzle likely with a pattern, let's try to see the sum of the 6 neighbors for a general n in such a spiral.

But perhaps there's a trick.

Notice that in a hexagonal grid, for any cell, the sum of the values of the 6 neighbors is equal to 6 times the average value in the neighborhood, but unless the numbers are assigned in a way that's arithmetic or has a simple relation, it's not directly helpful.

But in this spiral, the numbers are consecutive, but the mapping is not linear.

However, in such number spirals, often the sum of the neighbors of n is 6n - 3 or something similar, but let's test with n=1:

For n=1, sum of neighbors = 29

6*1 - 3 = 3, not 29

For n=2, sum of neighbors = 43

6*2 - 3 = 9

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of a cell and its 6 neighbors is constant on a ring or something.

But for n=1: 1 + 29 = 30

For n=2: 2 + 43 = 45

No obvious pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps for large n, the value at (q,r) is approximately proportional to the Manhattan distance or something, but not helpful for an exact answer.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the intended solution is to realize that in a hexagonal number spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of n is 6n - 3.

But from our calculation for n=1: 6*1 - 3 = 3, but actual sum is 29

Alternatively, perhaps there is a different approach.

Let’s try to find the coordinates of 2026 using the ring information.

We established that 2026 is in ring d=26, at position k=75 in the ring.

Each ring has 6 sides of 26 numbers each.

Let’s number the sides 0 to 5.

Each side has 26 numbers.

The starting point of the ring is at (26,0)

Then we go along each side for 26 steps.

Let’s define the 6 directions in order (let's use the following, as per standard hexagonal spiral):

Let’s use the directions as vectors in axial coordinates (q, r):

dir0: (1, 0)  # right
dir1: (0, 1)  # up
dir2: (-1, 1) # up-left
dir3: (-1, 0) # left
dir4: (0, -1) # down
dir5: (1, -1) # down-right

But to match the sample, let's check which direction we go first.

From the center, we go right to (1,0)=2, so dir0 is first.

Then from (1,0), we go up to (1,1)=3, so dir1 is up.

From (1,1), we go left to (0,1)=4, which is not a pure direction, but perhaps we go in dir2: (-1,1)

From (1,1) + (-1,1) = (0,2), but in our mapping (0,1)=4, so perhaps not.

Given the ambiguity, let's proceed with the standard.

Let’s define that for ring d, we start at (d,0)

Then for side s=0 to 5, for t=0 to d-1, the position is:

Let’s define current_q, current_r = d, 0

For s=0 to 5:

    for t=0 to d-1:
        assign number
        move in direction dirs[s]

But the direction for each side:

Let’s use:

s=0: dir0 = (1,0)  # but we already at (d,0), so perhaps start by moving in dir1

But to start the ring, we move in dir1 (up) first.

But let's use a known algorithm.

According to https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-axial with spiral generation:

But to save time, let's use the following approach:

Let’s define that for ring d, the numbers go as follows:

Start at (d,0) with number N_start = 2 + 3d(d-1)

Then move in direction (0,1) for d steps: positions (d,1), (d,2), ..., (d,d)

Then move in direction (-1,0) for d steps: (d-1,d), ..., (1,d)

Then move in direction (-1,-1) for d steps: (1,d-1), ..., (1,1)

Then move in direction (0,-1) for d steps: (1,0), (1,-1), ..., (1,-d+1)

Then move in direction (1,-1) for d steps: (2,-d+1), ..., (d,-d+1)

Then move in direction (1,0) for d-1 steps: (d,-d+2), ..., (d,-1)

But this is complicated.

Alternatively, let's use the function from here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1122790/how-to-find-coordinates-of-n-in-a-hexagonal-spiral

But for our purposes, let's assume we can compute the coordinates of 2026 as follows:

Let d = 26

The ring starts at N_start = 2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 1950 = 1952

The offset in the ring is k = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75

Each side has 26 numbers

Side = (k-1) // 26 = (75-1)//26 = 74//26 = 2 (since 26*2=52, 26*3=78>74)

So side 2

Position in side = (k-1) % 26 = 74 % 26 = 22

Now, let's define the 6 sides and how to compute the coordinates.

Let’s define the starting point of each side:

Side 0: starts at (26,0), direction (0,1) up, for 26 steps
Side 1: starts at (26,26), direction (-1,0) left, for 26 steps
Side 2: starts at (0,26), direction (-1,-1) down-left, for 26 steps
Side 3: starts at (-26,0), direction (0,-1) down, for 26 steps
Side 4: starts at (-26,-26), direction (1,-1) down-right, for 26 steps
Side 5: starts at (0,-26), direction (1,0) right, for 26 steps

But let's define precisely.

Let’s define the starting point for each side:

After completing side s-1, we are at the start of side s.

Let’s define the starting point of side 0 as (d,0)

Then for side 0, we move in direction (0,1) for d steps:

Positions: (d, t) for t=1 to d

So positions: (26,1), (26,2), ..., (26,26)

But the first number in the ring is at (26,0)=1952

Then (26,1)=1953
(26,2)=1954
...
(26,26)=1977

Then side 1: from (26,26), move in direction (-1,0) for d steps:

Positions: (26-t,26) for t=1 to 26

(25,26)=1978
(24,26)=1979
...
(0,26)=2003

Then side 2: from (0,26), move in direction (-1,-1) for d steps:

Positions: (0-t,26-t) for t=1 to 26

(-1,25)=2004
(-2,24)=2005
...
(-26,0)=2027

But we are looking for the 75th number in the ring.

Let’s compute how many numbers are in the first two sides:

Side 0: positions (26,1) to (26,26): 26 numbers (1953 to 1977)
Side 1: positions (25,26) to (0,26): 26 numbers (1978 to 2003)

So up to side 1, we have 52 numbers (1952 to 2003)

Side 2 starts at ( -1,25 ) = 2004

Position in side 2: index = 75 - 52 = 23 (since first in side 2 is 2004)

So the 23rd position in side 2

Side 2: from t=0 to 25

At t=0: (-1,25)=2004
t=1: (-2,24)=2005
...
t=22: (-23,3)=2004+22=2026

So at t=22: q = -1 - 22 = -23, r = 25 - 22 = 3

So the coordinates of 2026 are (q,r) = (-23, 3)

Now, the 6 neighbors of (q,r) = (-23,3) are:

(q+1, r) = (-22,3)
(q, r+1) = (-23,4)
(q-1, r+1) = (-24,4)
(q-1, r) = (-24,3)
(q, r-1) = (-23,2)
(q+1, r-1) = (-22,2)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these 6 coordinates.

To do this, we need a formula to compute the number at any (q,r).

From the spiral construction, we can derive a formula.

Let’s recall that the number at (q,r) can be computed based on the ring d = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|)

But let's use the following approach:

For a given (q,r), the ring d = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|)

But in axial coordinates, the distance from center is d = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|) / 2

But let's use the ring number d = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) (for this spiral)

But let's use the standard distance:

In axial coordinates, the distance from the origin is d = (|q| + |r| + |q + r|) / 2

For ( -23, 3 ):

q = -23, r = 3

q + r = -20

|q| = 23
|r| = 3
|q + r| = 20

d = (23 + 3 + 20) / 2 = 46 / 2 = 23

But earlier we had d=26 for 2026, but here d=23, which suggests our coordinate assignment may not match the earlier ring calculation.

But let's double-check.

Earlier we had for 2026: d=26

But according to the coordinates (-23,3), the distance is 23.

But the ring d is the maximum of |q|, |r|, |q+r|, but in this coordinate system, the layer is the Chebyshev distance or the hex distance.

But in our earlier calculation, we used the number of steps from the center, which is the hex distance d = (|q| + |r| + |q + r|) / 2

For (26,0): q=26, r=0, q+r=26, |q|=26, |r|=0, |q+r|=26, sum=52, d=26

For (-23,3): |q|=23, |r|=3, |q+r|=|-20|=20, sum=46, d=23

But 2026 is supposed to be in ring 26, but (-23,3) is in ring 23.

This suggests a miscalculation in the coordinate assignment for 2026.

Let’s revisit the side and position calculation.

We had:

Ring d=26 starts at 1952 at (26,0)

Side 0: (26, t) for t=1 to 26: 1953 to 1977

Side 1: (26-t, 26) for t=1 to 26: 1978 to 2003

Side 2: (-1 + t, 25 - t) for t=0 to 25? Let's clarify.

After side 1, we are at (0,26)

Then for side 2, we move in direction (-1,-1) for 26 steps:

From (0,26), add (-1,-1) repeatedly:

t=0: (0,26) [but this is the start, already used in side 1 end]
t=1: (-1,25)
t=2: (-2,24)
...
t=26: (-26,0)

So positions for side 2 are for t=1 to 26:

(q, r) = (0 - t, 26 - t) for t=1 to 26

So at t=1: (-1,25)
t
