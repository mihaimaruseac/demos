Here is a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

### 1. Understand the Structure of the Spiral

The numbers form layers, or "rings", of hexagons around the central number 1.
*   **Layer 0:** {1} (1 number)
*   **Layer 1:** {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 numbers)
*   **Layer 2:** {8, 9, ..., 19} (12 numbers)
*   **Layer k (for k>0):** Contains `6k` numbers.

The largest number in layer `k` is the total count of numbers up to that layer.
Total numbers up to layer `k` = `1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k)`
= `1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + k)`
= `1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2`
= `1 + 3k(k+1)`

Let's check this formula:
*   `k=1`: `1 + 3(1)(2) = 7` (Correct)
*   `k=2`: `1 + 3(2)(3) = 19` (Correct)
*   `k=3`: `1 + 3(3)(4) = 37` (Correct)

### 2. Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which layer `k` contains 2026. We can do this by finding `k` such that the largest number in layer `k-1` is less than 2026, and the largest number in layer `k` is greater than or equal to 2026.

`1 + 3(k-1)k < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3k(k+1)`

Let's approximate `3k(k+1) ≈ 3k²`.
`3k² ≈ 2025`
`k² ≈ 675`
`k ≈ √675`

Since `25² = 625` and `26² = 676`, `k` should be close to 26. Let's test `k=25` and `k=26`.

*   **Max number in layer 25:** `1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
*   **Max number in layer 26:** `1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, the number 2026 is in **layer k=26**.

### 3. Identify Neighbors and Find a Pattern

A number `N` on the spiral has 6 neighbors. These neighbors can be in the same layer (`k`), the inner layer (`k-1`), or the outer layer (`k+1`).

A key distinction is whether `N` is on a "corner" of its hexagonal layer or on a "side".
*   A **side number** has 2 neighbors in its layer, 1 in the inner layer, and 3 in the outer layer.
*   A **corner number** has 2 neighbors in its layer, 2 in the inner layer, and 2 in the outer layer.

The first number in layer `k=26` is `1951 + 1 = 1952`. Each side of the hexagon in layer `k` has `k` numbers. So, for `k=26`, each side has 26 numbers.
*   Side 1: 1952 to 1977
*   Side 2: 1978 to 2003
*   Side 3: 2004 to 2029

Since `2004 < 2026 < 2029`, 2026 is a **side number**.

Let `N` be a side number in layer `k`. Its neighbors are:
*   `N-1` and `N+1` (in layer `k`).
*   One inner neighbor, `N_i` (in layer `k-1`).
*   Three outer neighbors, `N_{o1}, N_{o2}, N_{o3}` (in layer `k+1`).

The sum of the neighbors is `S(N) = (N-1) + (N+1) + N_i + N_{o1} + N_{o2} + N_{o3}`.

### 4. The Sum Formula

For numbers on this spiral, there is a consistent pattern for the differences between a number and its neighbors in adjacent layers. The difference between a number `N` in layer `k` and its corresponding inner neighbor `N_i` is approximately `6(k-1)`, while the difference to its corresponding outer neighbor `N_o` is approximately `6k`.

More precisely, for a side number `N` in layer `k`:
*   Inner neighbor `N_i = N - (6(k-1) + 1) = N - 6k + 5`.
*   Central outer neighbor `N_{o2} = N + (6k + 1)`.
*   The other two outer neighbors are `N_{o2}-1` and `N_{o2}+1`.

Let's calculate the sum of the offsets from `N`:
`Sum of neighbors = (N-1) + (N+1) + (N - 6k + 5) + (N + 6k) + (N + 6k + 1) + (N + 6k + 2)`
`Sum = 6N - 1 + 1 - 6k + 5 + 18k + 3 = 6N + 12k + 8`

So, for any side number `N` in layer `k`, the sum of its neighbors is `S(N) = 6N + 12k + 8`.

### 5. Calculate the Final Sum

We have:
*   `N = 2026`
*   `k = 26`
*   `N` is a side number.

Now, we just plug these values into the formula:
`S(2026) = 6 * 2026 + 12 * 26 + 8`
`S(2026) = 12156 + 312 + 8`
`S(2026) = 12468 + 8`
`S(2026) = 12476`

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,476**.
