This is a fascinating problem that involves discovering the underlying structure of the hexagonal spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral's Structure

First, let's define the "rings" of the spiral.
*   Ring 0 is just the number 1.
*   Ring 1 consists of the numbers 2 through 7 (6 numbers).
*   Ring 2 consists of the numbers 8 through 19 (12 numbers).
*   Ring `k` (for k > 0) has `6k` numbers.

The last number in ring `k`, let's call it `L(k)`, is the total count of numbers up to that ring.
`L(k) = 1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k)`
`L(k) = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + k)`
Using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, `k(k+1)/2`:
`L(k) = 1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)`

Let's test this formula:
*   `L(0) = 1` (by definition)
*   `L(1) = 1 + 3(1)(2) = 7` (Correct)
*   `L(2) = 1 + 3(2)(3) = 19` (Correct)
*   `L(3) = 1 + 3(3)(4) = 37` (Correct)

### Step 2: Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which ring `k` contains the number 2026. This means that 2026 must be greater than the last number of ring `k-1` and less than or equal to the last number of ring `k`.
`L(k-1) < 2026 ≤ L(k)`

Let's estimate `k` using our formula `L(k) ≈ 3k²`:
`3k² ≈ 2026`
`k² ≈ 2026 / 3 ≈ 675.33`
`k ≈ sqrt(675.33)`
Since `25² = 625` and `26² = 676`, `k` should be around 26.

Let's calculate `L(25)` and `L(26)`:
*   `L(25) = 1 + 3 * 25 * 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`
*   `L(26) = 1 + 3 * 26 * 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, we can confirm that **2026 is in ring k=26**.

### Step 3: Find a Pattern for the Sum of Neighbors

This is the most crucial part. Instead of trying to find the exact value of each of the 6 neighbors, let's look for a general rule. Let `S(N)` be the sum of the neighbors of a number `N`.

Let's test some numbers and see if `S(N)` relates to `6N`.
We can distinguish between numbers on the "corners" of the spiral and those on the "sides".

A number is a **corner** if it's the last number on one of the 6 straight-line segments of its ring. A number on a side but not a corner is a **side number**. 2026 is a side number, as we'll see below.

Let's find the sum of neighbors for a few side numbers in a small ring, for example, `k=2`.
*   **N=12** (a side number in ring 2):
    *   Neighbors in the same ring: 11, 13.
    *   Neighbors in the inner ring (k=1): 4, 5.
    *   Neighbors in the outer ring (k=3): 26, 27.
    *   `S(12) = 11 + 13 + 4 + 5 + 26 + 27 = 86`.
    *   Let's compare this to `6N`: `6 * 12 = 72`. The difference is `86 - 72 = 14`.

*   **N=14** (another side number in ring 2):
    *   Neighbors: 13, 15 (same ring), 5, 6 (inner ring), 29, 30 (outer ring).
    *   `S(14) = 13 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 29 + 30 = 98`.
    *   Compare to `6N`: `6 * 14 = 84`. The difference is `98 - 84 = 14`.

It seems that for side numbers in ring `k=2`, the sum of neighbors is `S(N) = 6N + 14`.

Let's test a side number in ring `k=3`.
*   **N=21** (a side number in ring 3):
    *   Neighbors: 20, 22 (same ring), 8, 9 (inner ring), 39, 40 (outer ring).
    *   `S(21) = 20 + 22 + 8 + 9 + 39 + 40 = 138`.
    *   Compare to `6N`: `6 * 21 = 126`. The difference is `138 - 126 = 12`.

So for `k=3`, the formula is `S(N) = 6N + 12`.
We see a pattern in the correction factor:
*   For `k=2`, the correction is +14.
*   For `k=3`, the correction is +12.

The correction factor seems to decrease by 2 as `k` increases by 1. We can write this as `C(k) = C_0 - 2k`.
Let's find `C_0`:
`C(2) = C_0 - 2(2) = 14  => C_0 - 4 = 14 => C_0 = 18`.
So the formula for the sum of neighbors of a **side number** in ring `k` is:
`S(N) = 6N + 18 - 2k`

### Step 4: Verify 2026 is a Side Number

A number `N` in ring `k` is a corner if `N = L(k-1) + s*k` for `s` in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.
For `k=26`, `L(25)=1951` and the side length is 26.
The corners are:
*   `1951 + 1*26 = 1977`
*   `1951 + 2*26 = 2003`
*   `1951 + 3*26 = 2029`
*   ...and so on.

Since 2026 is not one of these values, it is a **side number**.

### Step 5: Calculate the Sum for 2026

We can now apply our discovered formula for `N=2026` and `k=26`:
`S(N) = 6N + 18 - 2k`
`S(2026) = 6 * 2026 + 18 - 2 * 26`
`S(2026) = 12156 + 18 - 52`
`S(2026) = 12174 - 52`
`S(2026) = 12122`

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,122**.
