This is a beautiful problem that involves understanding the structure of a hexagonal spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Rings

The numbers form concentric hexagonal rings around the number 1.
*   **Ring 0:** contains only the number 1.
*   **Ring 1:** contains numbers from 2 to 7. (6 numbers)
*   **Ring 2:** contains numbers from 8 to 19. (12 numbers)
*   **Ring 3:** contains numbers from 20 to 37. (18 numbers)

The number of elements in Ring `k` (for `k ≥ 1`) is `6k`.

Let `M(k)` be the largest number in Ring `k`.
*   `M(0) = 1`
*   `M(1) = M(0) + 6×1 = 1 + 6 = 7`
*   `M(2) = M(1) + 6×2 = 7 + 12 = 19`
*   `M(k) = M(k-1) + 6k`

We can find a general formula for `M(k)`:
`M(k) = 1 + Σ(6i) for i=1 to k`
`M(k) = 1 + 6 * (k(k+1)/2)`
`M(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1`

### Step 2: Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which ring `k` contains the number 2026. We can do this by finding `k` such that `M(k-1) < 2026 ≤ M(k)`.

Let's estimate `k` using the formula `3k² ≈ 2026`:
`k² ≈ 2026 / 3 ≈ 675`
`k ≈ √675`. Since `25²=625` and `26²=676`, `k` should be around 26.

Let's calculate `M(25)` and `M(26)`:
*   `M(25) = 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 76 = 1951`
*   `M(26) = 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 79 = 2107`

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, the number 2026 is in **Ring 26**.

### Step 3: Identify the Neighbors of a Number

A number `N` on a hexagonal grid has 6 neighbors. For a number `N` in Ring `k` that is not a corner:
*   Two neighbors are in the same ring: `N-1` and `N+1`.
*   One neighbor is in the inner ring (`k-1`).
*   Three neighbors are in the outer ring (`k+1`).

We need to check if 2026 is a "corner" number. A ring `k` has 6 sides, and the numbers are added sequentially. Each side has `k` numbers. The corners are the last number on each side.
*   The corners of Ring `k` are `M(k-1) + k`, `M(k-1) + 2k`, ..., `M(k-1) + 6k = M(k)`.

For Ring 26 (`k=26`), the first number is `M(25)+1 = 1952`. The corners are:
*   C1: `1951 + 26 = 1977`
*   C2: `1951 + 2*26 = 2003`
*   C3: `1951 + 3*26 = 2029`
*   ...and so on.

Our number, 2026, lies between the second corner (2003) and the third corner (2029). Therefore, **2026 is not a corner**. It lies on the 3rd side of the hexagon of Ring 26.

### Step 4: Find the Values of the 6 Neighbors

Let `N = 2026`. We are in Ring `k=26` on side `s=3`.

1.  **Same-Ring Neighbors:** These are simply `N-1` and `N+1`.
    *   Neighbor 1: `2025`
    *   Neighbor 2: `2027`

2.  **Inner-Ring Neighbor (`N_in`):** There is a consistent arithmetic relationship for numbers on the same side. The difference between a number `N` on side `s` of ring `k` and its inner neighbor is `6(k-1) + s`.
    *   Difference = `6(26-1) + 3 = 6(25) + 3 = 150 + 3 = 153`.
    *   `N_in = N - 153 = 2026 - 153 = 1873`.
    *   Neighbor 3: `1873`

3.  **Outer-Ring Neighbors:** A non-corner number has three neighbors in the outer ring. They are three consecutive numbers. Let's find the middle one (`N_out_mid`). The difference between `N_out_mid` and `N` is `6k + s`.
    *   Difference = `6(26) + 3 = 156 + 3 = 159`.
    *   `N_out_mid = N + 159 = 2026 + 159 = 2185`.
    *   The three outer neighbors are `N_out_mid - 1`, `N_out_mid`, and `N_out_mid + 1`.
    *   Neighbor 4: `2184`
    *   Neighbor 5: `2185`
    *   Neighbor 6: `2186`

### Step 5: Calculate the Sum

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1873, 2184, 2185, and 2186.

Let's sum them up:
Sum = `2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185 + 2186`
Sum = `(2026 - 1) + (2026 + 1) + 1873 + (2185 - 1) + 2185 + (2185 + 1)`
Sum = `2 * 2026 + 1873 + 3 * 2185`
Sum = `4052 + 1873 + 6555`
Sum = `5925 + 6555`
Sum = `12480`

### Alternative Method (using a derived formula)

We can derive a general formula for the sum of neighbors `S(N)` for a non-corner number `N` in ring `k` on side `s`.
`S(N) = (N-1) + (N+1) + N_in + (N_out_mid-1) + N_out_mid + (N_out_mid+1)`
`S(N) = 2N + N_in + 3 * N_out_mid`
Substitute the relationships we found:
`N_in = N - (6(k-1) + s) = N - 6k + 6 - s`
`N_out_mid = N + (6k + s)`
`S(N) = 2N + (N - 6k + 6 - s) + 3(N + 6k + s)`
`S(N) = 2N + N - 6k + 6 - s + 3N + 18k + 3s`
`S(N) = 6N + 12k + 2s + 6`

Let's apply this formula for `N=2026`, where `k=26` and `s=3`:
`S(2026) = 6(2026) + 12(26) + 2(3) + 6`
`S(2026) = 12156 + 312 + 6 + 6`
`S(2026) = 12156 + 324`
`S(2026) = 12480`

Both methods yield the same result.

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,480**.
