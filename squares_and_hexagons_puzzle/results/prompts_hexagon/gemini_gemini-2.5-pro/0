This is a fantastic problem that involves finding patterns in a spiral grid. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the structure of the spiral

The numbers form concentric hexagonal "rings" around the number 1.
*   **Ring 0:** Contains only the number 1.
*   **Ring 1:** Contains numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers). The last number is 7.
*   **Ring 2:** Contains numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers). The last number is 19.
*   **Ring k:** Contains `6k` numbers.

Let's find a formula for the largest number in ring `k`, which we'll call `M(k)`.
`M(k) = 1 + (sum of numbers in all rings up to k)`
`M(k) = 1 + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... + 6*k`
`M(k) = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + k)`
`M(k) = 1 + 6 * [k(k+1)/2]`
`M(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)`

Let's check this formula:
*   `M(1) = 1 + 3*1*(2) = 7`. Correct.
*   `M(2) = 1 + 3*2*(3) = 19`. Correct.
*   `M(3) = 1 + 3*3*(4) = 37`. Correct.

### Step 2: Locate the number 2026

We need to find which ring `k` contains the number 2026. This means `M(k-1) < 2026 <= M(k)`.
Let's approximate `k` using our formula:
`1 + 3k(k+1) ≈ 2026`
`3k(k+1) ≈ 2025`
`k(k+1) ≈ 675`
Since `25 * 26 = 650` and `26 * 27 = 702`, `k` should be 26.

Let's find the exact boundaries for `k=25` and `k=26`:
*   `M(25) = 1 + 3 * 25 * 26 = 1 + 3 * 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
*   `M(26) = 1 + 3 * 26 * 27 = 1 + 3 * 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.

Since `1951 < 2026 <= 2107`, we can confirm that **2026 is in ring k=26**.

### Step 3: Analyze the neighbors of a number

A number `N` in a hexagonal grid has 6 neighbors. Based on the spiral's structure, these neighbors can be in the same ring (`k`), the inner ring (`k-1`), or the outer ring (`k+1`).

There are two main types of numbers in a ring: "corners" and "non-corners" (numbers along the flat sides). Their neighbor patterns are different.
*   A **corner** is a number where the spiral path changes direction.
*   A **non-corner** is a number on a straight edge of the hexagon.

Let's find the corners of ring `k=26`. The number of elements on each of the 6 sides of the hexagon in ring `k` is `k`.
The first number of ring `k` is `M(k-1) + 1`. The corners are at intervals of `k`.
For ring 26 (`k=26`):
*   Start of ring: `M(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952`.
*   Corner 1: `1952 + 26 - 1 = 1977`. No, the corners are `M(k-1)+k`, `M(k-1)+2k` etc. Let's use a clearer definition. The side length is k, so the corners are separated by `k` numbers.
*   Corner C1: `M(25) + 26 = 1951 + 26 = 1977`. Let's recheck this. A side of length `k` has `k+1` numbers. Corners are every `k` steps.
    * The first number of the ring `M(k-1)+1` is the first corner. The path then goes `k-1` steps. The next number is the second corner. So corners are at `M(k-1)+1`, `M(k-1)+1+k`, etc.
    * Let's check for `k=2`: Ring starts at 8. `8+2=10`. `10+2=12`, etc. These are corners.
*   Corners of ring 26 (`k=26`):
    *   C1 = `1951 + 1 = 1952`
    *   C2 = `1952 + 26 = 1978`
    *   C3 = `1978 + 26 = 2004`
    *   C4 = `2004 + 26 = 2030`

Our number is 2026. Since `2004 < 2026 < 2030`, the number 2026 lies on the straight side between corners C3 and C4. It is a **non-corner** number.

### Step 4: Find the sum of neighbors for a non-corner number

Let `N` be a non-corner number in ring `k`. Its neighbors have a very regular pattern:
*   Two neighbors are in the same ring, `k`: `N-1` and `N+1`.
*   Two neighbors are in the inner ring, `k-1`.
*   Two neighbors are in the outer ring, `k+1`.

Let's analyze the difference between `N` and its neighbors. Let's take `N=9` (a non-corner in ring `k=2`) as an example. Its neighbors are 2, 3, 8, 10, 21, 22.
*   Same ring: `8 = 9-1`, `10 = 9+1`.
*   Inner ring (`k=1`, size 6): `3 = 9-6`, `2 = 9-7`. So `N - 6(k-1)` and `N - (6(k-1)+1)`.
*   Outer ring (`k=3`, size 18): `21 = 9+12`, `22 = 9+13`. So `N + 6k` and `N + 6k+1`.

This pattern holds for any non-corner number `N` in ring `k`. The six neighbors are:
1.  `N - 1`
2.  `N + 1`
3.  `N - 6(k-1)`
4.  `N - (6(k-1) + 1)`
5.  `N + 6k`
6.  `N + (6k + 1)`

Now, let's find the sum of these six neighbors:
Sum = `(N-1) + (N+1) + (N - 6k + 6) + (N - 6k + 5) + (N + 6k) + (N + 6k + 1)`

Let's group the terms:
Sum = `6N + (-1 + 1 - 6k + 6 - 6k + 5 + 6k + 6k + 1)`
The `-6k` and `+6k` terms cancel out.
Sum = `6N + (-1 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 1)`
Sum = `6N + 12`

### Step 5: Calculate the final answer

We found that 2026 is a non-corner number in ring `k=26`. So we can use our formula `Sum = 6N + 12`.

*   N = 2026
*   Sum = 6 * 2026 + 12
*   Sum = 12156 + 12
*   Sum = 12168

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,168**.
