This is a fascinating problem that involves understanding the structure of the hexagonal spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure: Rings

The numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal "rings" or "layers" around the number 1.
*   **Ring 0:** Contains only the number 1.
*   **Ring 1:** Contains numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers).
*   **Ring 2:** Contains numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers).
*   **Ring 3:** Contains numbers 20 to 37 (18 numbers).

In general, **Ring `k`** (for `k ≥ 1`) contains `6k` numbers.

Let's find a formula for the last number in Ring `k`, which we'll call `N_k`.
`N_k = 1 + (sum of numbers in all rings up to k)`
`N_k = 1 + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... + 6*k`
`N_k = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + k)`
Using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, `k(k+1)/2`:
`N_k = 1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2`
`N_k = 1 + 3k(k+1)`

Let's test this:
*   `k=1`: `N_1 = 1 + 3(1)(2) = 7`. Correct.
*   `k=2`: `N_2 = 1 + 3(2)(3) = 19`. Correct.
*   `k=3`: `N_3 = 1 + 3(3)(4) = 37`. Correct.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find which ring `k` contains 2026. We are looking for `k` such that `N_{k-1} < 2026 ≤ N_k`.
Let's approximate `3k^2 ≈ 2026`, which gives `k^2 ≈ 675`. Since `25^2 = 625` and `26^2 = 676`, `k` should be around 26.

*   Let's find the last number of Ring 25 (`k=25`):
    `N_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
*   Let's find the last number of Ring 26 (`k=26`):
    `N_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, we can confirm that **2026 is in Ring 26**.

### 3. Types of Numbers: Corners vs. Sides

Within each ring `k` (for `k>1`), there are two types of numbers:
*   **Corners:** The 6 numbers at the vertices of the hexagon.
*   **Side-numbers:** The numbers that lie along the edges between the corners.

The numbers on each of the 6 sides of the hexagon in Ring `k` follow a sequence of length `k`. A number is a corner if its position along the ring's path is a multiple of `k`.

*   The first number in Ring 26 is `N_{25} + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952`.
*   The position of 2026 along the path of Ring 26 is `2026 - 1952 = 74`. We can call this the path index `p`.
*   The corners of Ring 26 are at path indices `p` where `p+1` is a multiple of the side length, `k=26`.
*   For 2026, `p+1 = 75`. Since 75 is not a multiple of 26, **2026 is a side-number**.

### 4. Neighbors of a Side-Number

A side-number `N` that is not directly adjacent to a corner has a specific set of 6 neighbors:
*   Two neighbors are in the same ring: `N-1` and `N+1`.
*   One neighbor is in the inner ring (`k-1`).
*   Three neighbors are in the outer ring (`k+1`).

The geometry of the spiral reveals a crucial pattern:
*   The single inner neighbor is a **corner** of the inner ring.
*   The three outer neighbors are consecutive numbers, centered on a **corner** of the outer ring.

These corresponding inner and outer corners lie on the same radial "spoke" from the center. We need to identify which spoke 2026 lies on.

*   The path of Ring 26 has a total length of `6 * 26 = 156` numbers (`p` from 0 to 155).
*   The path is divided into 6 sides.
*   The 3rd side begins after the 2nd corner, at `p+1 = 2*26+1 = 53`, and ends at the 3rd corner, `p+1 = 3*26 = 78`.
*   Since `52 < 75 ≤ 78`, 2026 is on the **3rd side** of the hexagon.

This means its inner and outer corner-neighbors are the 3rd corners of their respective rings.

### 5. Calculating the Neighbors

Let's find the formula for the `s`-th corner of Ring `k`, `C(k,s)`.
*   Start of Ring `k`: `N_{k-1}+1 = 3k(k-1)+2`.
*   Path index `p` of the `s`-th corner: `s*k - 1`.
*   `C(k,s) = (3k(k-1)+2) + (s*k - 1) = 3k^2 - 3k + 1 + sk`.

**a) Inner Neighbor (in Ring 25):**
This is the 3rd corner of Ring 25 (`k=25, s=3`).
`N_in = C(25, 3) = 3(25)^2 - 3(25) + 1 + 3(25) = 3(625) + 1 = 1875 + 1 = 1876`.

**b) Outer Neighbors (in Ring 27):**
These are centered on the 3rd corner of Ring 27 (`k=27, s=3`).
`C_out = C(27, 3) = 3(27)^2 - 3(27) + 1 + 3(27) = 3(27)^2 + 1 = 3(729) + 1 = 2187 + 1 = 2188`.
The three outer neighbors are `C_out-1`, `C_out`, and `C_out+1`, which are **2187, 2188, 2189**.

**c) Same-Ring Neighbors:**
These are simply `2026-1` and `2026+1`, which are **2025** and **2027**.

### 6. The Final Sum

Now we sum all 6 neighbors:
*   Same-ring neighbors: `2025 + 2027 = 4052`
*   Inner neighbor: `1876`
*   Outer neighbors: `2187 + 2188 + 2189 = 6564`

Total Sum = `4052 + 1876 + 6564`
Total Sum = `5928 + 6564`
Total Sum = `12492`

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,492**.
