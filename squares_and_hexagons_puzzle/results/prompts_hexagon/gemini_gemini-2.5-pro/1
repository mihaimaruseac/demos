This problem requires us to understand the structure of a spiral on a hexagonal grid and then find a relationship between a number and its neighbors. A direct calculation by mapping out the grid up to 2026 would be extremely tedious, so we should look for a pattern.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral Structure

First, let's analyze the structure of the spiral.
- The number 1 is at the center.
- The first ring (or layer) consists of numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers).
- The second ring consists of numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers).
- The third ring consists of numbers 20 to 37 (18 numbers).

In general, ring `k` (for `k ≥ 1`) contains `6k` numbers.

Let `M(k)` be the largest number in ring `k`.
- `M(0) = 1`
- `M(1) = 1 + 6 = 7`
- `M(2) = 7 + 12 = 19`
- `M(3) = 19 + 18 = 37`
The general formula for `M(k)` is:
`M(k) = 1 + Σ_{i=1 to k} 6i = 1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)`.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find which ring the number `N = 2026` is in. We need to find `k` such that `M(k-1) < 2026 ≤ M(k)`.
Let's approximate `k`: `3k(k+1) ≈ 2025`, so `k(k+1) ≈ 675`.
Since `25 * 26 = 650` and `26 * 27 = 702`, we can deduce that `k=26`.

Let's check:
- `M(25) = 1 + 3 * 25 * 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
- `M(26) = 1 + 3 * 26 * 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, the number 2026 is in ring `k=26`.

### 3. Finding the Sum of Neighbors

Let's denote the sum of the neighbors of a number `N` as `S(N)`. We will analyze the relationship between `N` and `S(N)` by looking at a few examples from the inner rings. To do this, we need a consistent grid layout. Based on the spiral's properties, a number `N` and its neighbors form a hexagon. The neighbors come in 3 opposite pairs.

Let's test a number in ring 2, for example `N=12`.
By carefully constructing the grid, we can identify the 6 neighbors of 12:
- From the same ring (ring 2): `11` and `13`.
- From the inner ring (ring 1): `3` and `4`.
- From the outer ring (ring 3): `26` and `27`.
The six neighbors of 12 are `3, 4, 11, 13, 26, 27`.

Let's sum them: `S(12) = 3 + 4 + 11 + 13 + 26 + 27 = 84`.
Now, let's compare this to `6 * 12 = 72`. The difference is `84 - 72 = 12`. So, `S(12) = 6 * 12 + 12`.

Let's organize the neighbors of 12 into opposite pairs. On a hexagonal grid, if we trace the neighbors in order, the 1st is opposite the 4th, 2nd opposite the 5th, and 3rd opposite the 6th. The neighbors of 12 in order are `11, 26, 27, 13, 4, 3`.
- Pair 1: `11 + 13 = 24 = 2 * 12`.
- Pair 2: `26 + 4 = 30 = 2 * 12 + 6`.
- Pair 3: `27 + 3 = 30 = 2 * 12 + 6`.

The total sum is `(2 * 12) + (2 * 12 + 6) + (2 * 12 + 6) = 6 * 12 + 12 = 84`.

This reveals a remarkable pattern. For a number `N`, the sum of an opposite pair of its neighbors is close to `2N`. One pair (the tangential neighbors `N-1` and `N+1`) sums to exactly `2N`. The other two pairs (the radial neighbors) each sum to `2N+6`. This is because the difference between radially corresponding numbers increases by 6 for each layer of the spiral.

This pattern holds for any number `N` that is not a "corner" of a ring. A corner number is the last number on each of the six sides of the hexagonal ring.

Let's verify if 2026 is a corner number in ring 26.
Ring 26 starts with 1952. Each side of the hexagon in ring 26 has 26 numbers.
- Side 1 ends at: `1951 + 26 = 1977`.
- Side 2 ends at: `1977 + 26 = 2003`.
- Side 3 ends at: `2003 + 26 = 2029`.
The number 2026 lies on side 3 (between 2004 and 2029), so it is not a corner number.

The formula `S(N) = 6N + 12` is valid for non-corner numbers in rings `k ≥ 2`. Since 2026 is in ring 26 and is not a corner, we can apply this formula.

### 4. Calculation

We apply the formula `S(N) = 6N + 12` for `N = 2026`.

`S(2026) = 6 * 2026 + 12`
`S(2026) = 12156 + 12`
`S(2026) = 12168`

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12168.
