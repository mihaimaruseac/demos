To determine the sum of all **6 neighbors** of the number **2026** in the given **hexagonal spiral**, we must understand how numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid and then locate the position of 2026 within that structure.

### 🔍 Step 1: Determine the Ring and Side

In a hexagonal spiral:

- The **center** is at ring $ m = 0 $, containing only the number **1**.
- Each subsequent **ring** $ m \geq 1 $ contains $ 6m $ numbers.
- Total numbers up to and including ring $ m $ is:
  $$
  S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)
  $$

We find the ring containing 2026 by solving for the smallest $ m $ such that $ S(m) \geq 2026 $:

$$
S(26) = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
$$
$$
S(25) = 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
$$

So, **2026 lies in ring $ m = 26 $**.

The first number of ring 26 is:
$$
\text{start}_m = S(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952
$$

Ring 26 has 6 sides, each with 26 numbers. We divide it as follows:
- Side 0 (East): 1952 to 1977
- Side 1 (Northeast): 1978 to 2003
- Side 2 (Northwest): 2004 to 2029
- Side 3 (West): 2030 to 2055
- Side 4 (Southwest): 2056 to 2081
- Side 5 (Southeast): 2082 to 2107

Since **2026 ∈ [2004, 2029]**, it is on **side 2**.

Let’s define the offset $ t $ on side 2:
$$
t = 2026 - 2004 = 22
$$

### 🧭 Step 2: Coordinates of the Number

In axial coordinates $(q, r)$:
- For **side 2** (Northwest), the coordinate is:
  $$
  q = -m = -26,\quad r = m - t = 26 - 22 = 4
  $$
  So, **2026** is located at $(-26, 4)$

### 🧮 Step 3: Compute Neighbors in Axial Coordinates

The six neighbors of any cell $(q, r)$ in a hexagonal grid (axial coordinate system) are:

| Direction     | Axial Change         | New Coordinate |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| East          | (q+1, r)            | (-25, 4)      |
| Northeast     | (q, r+1)            | (-26, 5)      |
| Northwest     | (q-1, r+1)          | (-27, 5)      |
| West          | (q-1, r)            | (-27, 4)      |
| Southwest     | (q, r-1)            | (-26, 3)      |
| Southeast     | (q+1, r-1)          | (-25, 3)      |

---

### 📐 Step 4: Calculate Corresponding Numbers

All six neighbors lie on **side 2** of some ring because they maintain the same direction (Northwest side). Using the formula for side 2:

$$
\text{Number} = 3m^2 - r + 2
$$

Where:
- $ m $: ring number (determined from max(|q|, |r|, |q + r|))
- $ r $: r-coordinate of the point

Apply this to each neighbor:

| Neighbor     | Coordinates | $ m $ | $ r $ | Number = $ 3m^2 - r + 2 $ |
|--------------|--------------|--------|--------|----------------------------|
| East         | (-25, 4)    | 25     | 4      | $ 3 \cdot 625 - 4 + 2 = 1873 $ |
| Northeast    | (-26, 5)    | 26     | 5      | $ 3 \cdot 676 - 5 + 2 = 2025 $ |
| Northwest    | (-27, 5)    | 27     | 5      | $ 3 \cdot 729 - 5 + 2 = 2184 $ |
| West         | (-27, 4)    | 27     | 4      | $ 3 \cdot 729 - 4 + 2 = 2185 $ |
| Southwest    | (-26, 3)    | 26     | 3      | $ 3 \cdot 676 - 3 + 2 = 2027 $ |
| Southeast    | (-25, 3)    | 25     | 3      | $ 3 \cdot 625 - 3 + 2 = 1874 $ |

---

### 🔢 Final Step: Sum All Neighbor Values

Add all six neighbor values:

$$
1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{12168}
