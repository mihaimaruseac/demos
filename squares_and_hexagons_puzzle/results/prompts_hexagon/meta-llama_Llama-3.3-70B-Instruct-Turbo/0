## Step 1: Understand the layout and pattern of the numbers in the hexagonal grid.
The numbers are laid out in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid, starting from the center. To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to first locate the position of 2026 in this grid.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 in the grid.
Given the spiral pattern, the numbers increase as we move outward. To locate 2026, we need to understand the layers of the spiral. Each layer adds 6 more numbers than the previous layer. The first layer has 1 number, the second layer adds 6 numbers (total 7), the third layer adds 12 numbers (total 19), and so on. We calculate the cumulative sum of numbers up to each layer to find where 2026 falls.

## Step 3: Calculate the cumulative sum for each layer until we reach or surpass 2026.
Layer 1 has 1 number, Layer 2 has 1 + 6 = 7 numbers, Layer 3 has 7 + 12 = 19 numbers, Layer 4 has 19 + 18 = 37 numbers, Layer 5 has 37 + 24 = 61 numbers, and so on. We continue this pattern until we reach a layer that includes 2026.

## Step 4: Identify the layer where 2026 is located.
By calculating or looking for a pattern, we notice that the nth layer contains 3n^2 - 3n + 1 numbers. We need to solve for n when the number of elements is at least 2026. This involves finding the smallest n such that 3n^2 - 3n + 1 >= 2026.

## Step 5: Solve the inequality 3n^2 - 3n + 1 >= 2026 for n.
Rearranging the inequality gives us 3n^2 - 3n - 2025 >= 0. Solving this quadratic inequality, we find the roots of the equation 3n^2 - 3n - 2025 = 0 and determine the minimum n that satisfies the condition.

## Step 6: Calculate the roots of the quadratic equation.
Using the quadratic formula, n = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), with a = 3, b = -3, and c = -2025, we find n. The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4*3*(-2025) = 9 + 24300 = 24309. So, n = (3 ± sqrt(24309)) / 6.

## Step 7: Solve for n.
Calculating the values gives n = (3 ± 155.55) / 6. Considering positive n, n ≈ (3 + 155.55) / 6 ≈ 26.59. Since n must be an integer and we're looking for the layer where 2026 is, we consider n = 26, as this is the first whole layer that would encompass 2026.

## Step 8: Verify if 2026 is indeed in the 26th layer.
We calculate the total numbers up to the 25th layer and verify if 2026 falls within the 26th layer. The 25th layer ends at 3*25^2 - 3*25 + 1 = 1875 numbers. The 26th layer starts after this and includes numbers up to 3*26^2 - 3*26 + 1 = 2025 numbers. Thus, 2026 is the first number in the 27th layer, not the 26th.

## Step 9: Correctly place 2026 in the grid.
Since 2026 is the first number in the 27th layer, it is located at one of the corners of the hexagon, where it only has 3 neighbors that are part of the 26th layer and 3 neighbors that would be in the 27th layer with it.

## Step 10: Calculate the positions of the neighbors.
The three neighbors in the previous layer (26th) are the last three numbers of the 26th layer. Given the spiral pattern, these would be 2023, 2024, and 2025. The next three numbers in the sequence (also neighbors of 2026 in the 27th layer) would be 2027, 2028, and 2029.

## Step 11: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
The sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029.

## Step 12: Perform the addition.
2023 + 2024 = 4047, 4047 + 2025 = 6072, 6072 + 2027 = 8099, 8099 + 2028 = 10127, 10127 + 2029 = 12156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12156}$
