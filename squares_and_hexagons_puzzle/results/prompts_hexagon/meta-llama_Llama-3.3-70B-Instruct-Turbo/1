## Step 1: Understanding the hexagonal grid layout
The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid, meaning each number (except those on the edges) has six neighbors. The pattern of numbers moving in a spiral outward is key to understanding how numbers are positioned relative to each other.

## Step 2: Identifying the position of the number 2026
To find the number 2026, we must understand the pattern of how numbers are arranged. The spiral starts from the center with 1 and moves outward in a clockwise direction. We need to figure out the layer and position of 2026 in this spiral.

## Step 3: Calculating the layer of the number 2026
Each layer of the hexagon adds a certain number of new positions. The first layer (the center) has 1 position, the second layer has 6 positions, the third layer has 12 positions, and so on. The number of positions in each new layer increases by 6. To find which layer 2026 is in, we can sum the positions layer by layer until we reach or surpass 2026.

## Step 4: Determining the exact position of 2026
Once we identify the layer, we need to find the exact position of 2026 within that layer. This involves calculating how many numbers are in the layers before the one containing 2026 and then determining its position within the layer.

## Step 5: Finding the neighbors of 2026
After identifying the position of 2026, we need to find its six neighbors. These are the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in all six directions of the hexagonal grid.

## Step 6: Calculating the sum of the neighbors
Once the neighbors are identified, we need to sum them up to get the final answer.

## Step 7: Execution of the plan
Let's execute the plan by first finding the layer and then the exact position of 2026. Given the complexity and the need for precision, this step involves detailed calculations based on the pattern of the hexagonal grid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8129}$
