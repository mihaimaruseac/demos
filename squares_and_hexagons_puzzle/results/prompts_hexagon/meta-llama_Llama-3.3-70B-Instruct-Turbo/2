## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid, meaning that each number has six neighbors. The pattern of the spiral is such that the numbers increase as you move outward from the center.

## Step 2: Identify the location of the number 2026
Since the numbers increase as you move outward, we can deduce that the number 2026 will be located on a certain layer of the hexagonal grid. We need to determine which layer and the position of 2026 on that layer.

## Step 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we can analyze the pattern of the spiral. The first layer contains the number 1, the second layer contains numbers 2-7, the third layer contains numbers 8-19, and so on. By examining the pattern, we can see that the nth layer contains numbers from $(3n^2 - 3n + 2)$ to $(3n^2 + 3n + 1)$.

## Step 4: Calculate the layer of the number 2026
We need to solve for n such that $(3n^2 - 3n + 2) \leq 2026 \leq (3n^2 + 3n + 1)$. This inequality can be rewritten as $3n^2 - 3n + 2 \leq 2026$ and $2026 \leq 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.

## Step 5: Calculate the value of n
We can estimate the value of n by solving the inequality. By trying out different values of n, we find that when n = 26, $(3n^2 - 3n + 2) = 2002$ and $(3n^2 + 3n + 1) = 2081$. Therefore, 2026 is located on the 32nd layer (since we start counting from n = 1, not n = 0), but more precisely, it's on a layer that can be calculated more exactly by considering the range it falls into.

## Step 6: Calculate the exact layer
Let's calculate more precisely: the smallest n such that $3n^2 - 3n + 2 \geq 2026$ can be found through trial and error or approximation. We find n = 26 gives us a range that includes 2026.

## Step 7: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026
The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 can be found by using the fact that the numbers on the hexagonal grid are arranged in a specific pattern. Given that we're on the 26th layer (as the estimate indicates), we can calculate the sum of the neighbors based on their relative positions.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The number 2026 is on the 26th layer. We can determine its exact position and the positions of its neighbors by counting from the start of the layer. Since the numbers increase consecutively on each layer, once we find the starting number of the 26th layer, we can easily find the numbers adjacent to 2026.

## Step 9: Calculate the starting number of the 26th layer
The starting number of the nth layer can be found using the formula $(3n^2 - 3n + 2)$. For n = 26, the starting number is $(3*26^2 - 3*26 + 2) = 2002$.

## Step 10: Determine the position of 2026 on the 26th layer
2026 is located at $2026 - 2002 + 1 = 25$ positions from the start of the 26th layer.

## Step 11: Identify the neighbors
Given the hexagonal grid structure, the neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers directly adjacent to it on the grid. These include the numbers on the same layer and the layers directly above and below it.

## Step 12: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is the 25th number on the 26th layer, its neighbors will include the 24th and 26th numbers on the same layer, and four numbers from adjacent layers. However, due to the symmetrical nature of the grid and the pattern of numbering, the sum of the neighbors of any number on this grid can be derived from the number itself and its position relative to the center.

## Step 13: Derive the formula for the sum of neighbors
In a hexagonal grid, due to its symmetry and the pattern of numbering, the sum of the neighbors of a number can be related to the number itself and the layer it's on. Given the nature of this specific problem, we need to consider the pattern and derive a formula or approach that applies to the given grid structure.

## Step 14: Apply the derived formula or approach
However, a key insight simplifies this calculation: for any number X on this grid, the sum of its neighbors can be determined based on its position and the structure of the grid. Given the specific nature of this problem, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 can be directly related to its value and the inherent symmetry of the hexagonal grid's numbering pattern.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2026+4(2002+25+1)+4(2002+25-1)}$
