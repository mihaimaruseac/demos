## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the hexagonal grid
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid. To find the neighbors of a number, we need to understand how this spiral works and how numbers are arranged relative to each other.

## Step 2: Identify the position of the number 2026
Since the pattern starts from the center and spirals outward, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 within this spiral. Given the sequence, it seems that each layer of the hexagon contains 6 more numbers than the previous layer.

## Step 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
Starting from 1 and spiraling outwards, the first layer (the center) contains 1 number, the second layer contains 6 numbers (from 2 to 7), the third layer contains 12 numbers (from 8 to 19), and so on. The nth layer contains 6n numbers. To find which layer 2026 is in, we can calculate the cumulative sum of numbers in each layer until we reach or surpass 2026.

## Step 4: Calculate the cumulative sum of numbers up to each layer
- First layer: 1 number
- Second layer: 1 + 6 = 7 numbers
- Third layer: 7 + 12 = 19 numbers
- Fourth layer: 19 + 18 = 37 numbers
- Continuing this pattern, we increase the difference by 6 each time (6, 12, 18, 24,...).

## Step 5: Find the specific layer for the number 2026
Given that the differences between the cumulative sums are increasing by 6 each time (6, 12, 18,...), we continue the sequence until we find the layer that includes 2026.

## Step 6: Perform the calculations to find the layer of 2026
We need to find the first cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to 2026 by following the sequence:
- Layer 1: 1
- Layer 2: 1 + 6 = 7
- Layer 3: 7 + 12 = 19
- Layer 4: 19 + 18 = 37
- Layer 5: 37 + 24 = 61
- Layer 6: 61 + 30 = 91
- Layer 7: 91 + 36 = 127
- Layer 8: 127 + 42 = 169
- Layer 9: 169 + 48 = 217
- Layer 10: 217 + 54 = 271
- Layer 11: 271 + 60 = 331
- Layer 12: 331 + 66 = 397
- Layer 13: 397 + 72 = 469
- Layer 14: 469 + 78 = 547
- Layer 15: 547 + 84 = 631
- Layer 16: 631 + 90 = 721
- Layer 17: 721 + 96 = 817
- Layer 18: 817 + 102 = 919
- Layer 19: 919 + 108 = 1027
2026 falls into the 19th layer because 919 < 2026 ≤ 1027 + 114 (since the next layer's numbers would start after 1027 and go up to 1027 + 114).

## Step 7: Determine the neighbors of 2026
Knowing that 2026 is in the 19th layer, we can deduce its position relative to the start of the layer. Since each layer has a specific number of elements and they are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, the neighbors of any number in the inner part of a layer (not on the edges) would include the numbers directly adjacent to it in all six directions.

## Step 8: Calculate the neighbors
Given that 2026 is towards the end of the 19th layer, we can calculate the position of its neighbors. If we consider the arrangement, the direct neighbors would be the numbers immediately before and after it in the sequence, as well as the numbers diagonally adjacent, which can be determined by understanding the pattern of how numbers are laid out in the hexagonal grid.

## Step 9: Apply the hexagonal grid pattern to find the exact neighbors
Since 2026 is in the 19th layer, and considering the pattern of numbers increasing by 1 as we move around the hexagon, we find that 2026 is the 108th number in its layer (2026 - 919 = 1107, and since the 19th layer starts after 919, and there are 108 numbers before it in the same layer, 2026 is the 1107th number overall, but 108th in its layer). The neighbors would thus include the numbers immediately before and after 2026 in the sequence (2025 and 2027), as well as four other numbers that are diagonally or directly adjacent in the hexagonal pattern.

## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Given the position of 2026, we can now calculate the sum of its neighbors. The immediate neighbors in the sequence are 2025 and 2027. The other neighbors can be determined by the pattern of the hexagonal grid, which typically involves numbers that are a fixed amount more or less than the central number, depending on the direction.

However, due to the complexity of directly calculating each neighbor without visual aid, a more efficient approach involves recognizing the pattern of differences in the hexagonal grid. For a number like 2026, which is not on the edge of the grid, its neighbors will include numbers that are close to it but adjusted according to the hexagonal pattern.

## Step 11: Simplify the calculation by considering the pattern
Recognizing that the exact positions of the neighbors can be determined by the hexagonal pattern, we can simplify the calculation. The sum of the neighbors can be determined by considering the symmetrical and structured nature of the hexagonal grid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2026+2024+2027+2025+2028+2029=12159}$
