## Step 1: Understand the hexagonal grid layout
The problem presents a hexagonal grid where natural numbers are written in a spiral pattern. To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to understand the pattern of the grid and how the numbers are arranged.

## Step 2: Identify the layers of the grid
The grid can be divided into layers, with each layer consisting of numbers arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The number of elements in each layer can be derived based on the position of the layer. Layer 0 has 1 element, layer 1 has 6 elements, layer 2 has 12 elements, and so on. This indicates that the nth layer has 6n elements.

## Step 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To determine the layer where the number 2026 resides, we can calculate the cumulative sum of elements up to each layer until we reach or exceed 2026. Starting from layer 0, we add the elements in each layer: 1 (layer 0) + 6 (layer 1) + 12 (layer 2) +... until the sum is greater than or equal to 2026.

## Step 4: Calculate the layer of the number 2026
By performing the cumulative sum, we find that 2026 is located on the 17th layer of the grid (using the formula for the nth layer and checking the cumulative sum).

## Step 5: Find the neighbors of the number 2026
Since 2026 is on the 17th layer, we need to identify its 6 neighbors, which will be the numbers directly surrounding it on the grid. These neighbors will be on the same layer (17th layer) and the adjacent layers (16th and 18th layers).

## Step 6: Calculate the values of the neighbors
The numbers on the grid follow a pattern where each number is one more than the previous number when moving clockwise around the spiral. Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 can be found by considering the relative positions on the grid.

## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Once we have identified the neighbors of 2026, we can calculate their sum.

## Step 8: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
The neighbors of 2026 form an arithmetic sequence. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find their sum.

## Step 9: Apply the formula to calculate the sum
The numbers 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, and 2029 are the neighbors of 2026. The sum of these numbers can be calculated directly.

## Step 10: Sum the neighbors
Sum = 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 12180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12180}$
