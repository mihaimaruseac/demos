## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid, which means each number has 6 neighbors. To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to first locate 2026 in the spiral.

## Step 2: Determine the position of 2026 in the spiral
Since the spiral starts from 1 and moves outward in a hexagonal pattern, we can calculate the position of 2026 by understanding the layers of the spiral. Each layer adds 6 more numbers than the previous layer. The first layer has 1 number, the second layer adds 6 numbers (total 7), the third layer adds 12 numbers (total 19), and so on. We can express the total numbers up to the nth layer as 1 + 6 + 12 +... + 6n. This is an arithmetic series with the first term a = 1, common difference d = 6, and the number of terms n. The sum of an arithmetic series S = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1) * d]. We need to find which layer 2026 falls into.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer for 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. We want to find n such that the sum is greater than or equal to 2026. So we solve for n in the inequality 1 + 6 + 12 +... + 6n >= 2026, which simplifies to n/2 * [2 * 1 + (n - 1) * 6] >= 2026. This further simplifies to 3n^2 + 3n - 2026 >= 0.

## Step 4: Solve the quadratic inequality for n
To solve the quadratic inequality 3n^2 + 3n - 2026 >= 0, we can use the quadratic formula or factorization to find the roots of the equation 3n^2 + 3n - 2026 = 0. The quadratic formula is n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 3, b = 3, and c = -2026.

## Step 5: Apply the quadratic formula
Substitute the values into the quadratic formula: n = [-3 ± sqrt(3^2 - 4 * 3 * -2026)] / (2 * 3). This simplifies to n = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 24312)] / 6, which further simplifies to n = [-3 ± sqrt(24321)] / 6. Calculating, we get n = [-3 ± 155.67] / 6. Considering the positive root since n must be positive, n = [-3 + 155.67] / 6, which equals approximately 25.44. Since n must be a whole number (representing the layer number), we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we are looking at a layer that includes 2026, so n = 26.

## Step 6: Calculate the numbers in the 26th layer
The 26th layer will have 6 * 26 = 156 numbers. The first number in this layer can be found by calculating the total numbers in the previous 25 layers, which is the sum of an arithmetic series with 25 terms, first term a = 1, and common difference d = 6. This sum is S = 25/2 * [2 * 1 + (25 - 1) * 6].

## Step 7: Find the first number of the 26th layer
Calculate the sum of the first 25 layers: S = 25/2 * [2 + 24 * 6] = 25/2 * [2 + 144] = 25/2 * 146 = 25 * 73 = 1825. So, the first number in the 26th layer is 1825 + 1 = 1826, since we start counting from 1.

## Step 8: Locate 2026 in the 26th layer
2026 is in the 26th layer since 1826 (first number of the 26th layer) + 200 = 2026. Given the structure, 2026 will be on the edge of the hexagon, and its neighbors will include numbers from the 25th and 26th layers.

## Step 9: Identify the neighbors
To find the neighbors of 2026, we consider the hexagonal structure. The direct neighbors of any number on the edge of the spiral will include 3 numbers from the same layer (since it's on the edge) and 3 numbers from the adjacent inner layer. For 2026, its direct neighbors on the same layer (26th) are 2025, 2027, and one number before 2025 (which would be 2024), and from the inner layer (25th), we need to consider the structure to find the exact neighbors.

## Step 10: Calculate the exact neighbors
Since 2026 is the 201st number in the 26th layer (2026 - 1825 = 201), its neighbors on the same layer are 2025 (200th number), 2027 (202nd number), and 2024 (199th number). For the inner layer, considering the hexagonal structure, the neighbors would be the 3 numbers directly adjacent to the position of 2026 but in the inner layer. This includes the last number of the 25th layer (which is 2025 - 6 = 2019, since we move 6 numbers back to reach the start of the inner edge), the second to last (2018), and the third to last (2017).

## Step 11: Sum the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 includes the numbers 2025, 2027, 2024 from the same layer, and 2019, 2018, 2017 from the inner layer. Summing these, we get 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2019 + 2018 + 2017.

## Step 12: Perform the summation
2025 + 2027 = 4052, 4052 + 2024 = 6076, 6076 + 2019 = 8095, 8095 + 2018 = 10113, 10113 + 2017 = 12130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12130}$
