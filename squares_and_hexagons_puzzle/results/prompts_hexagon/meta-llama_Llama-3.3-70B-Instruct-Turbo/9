## Step 1: Identify the number 2026 and its position in the spiral
To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral. Since the spiral is laid out in a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors.

## Step 2: Understand the pattern of the spiral
Looking at the given part of the spiral, we can observe the pattern in which the numbers are arranged. The numbers increase as we move outward from the center in a spiral manner.

## Step 3: Notice the relationship between numbers and their positions
Each number in the spiral can be represented as the sum of the numbers in the inner layers. The difference between consecutive numbers in the outer layer is constant and related to the layer number.

## Step 4: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we can use the fact that the numbers in each layer form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference that increases by 2 for each subsequent layer.

## Step 5: Recognize that each layer's numbers can be represented by a formula
Each number can be represented as the sum of the numbers in the previous layers plus its position in the current layer.

## Step 6: Identify the position of 2026 in its layer
We can calculate the position of 2026 in its layer by using the formula for the nth number in the hexagonal spiral, which can be derived based on the pattern.

## Step 7: Derive the formula for the nth number
The formula to find the nth number in the hexagonal spiral can be derived based on the pattern observed.

## Step 8: Apply the formula to find the position and neighbors of 2026
By applying the formula, we can find the position of 2026 and identify its 6 neighbors.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighbors
Once the 6 neighbors are identified, their sum can be calculated.

## Step 10: Derive the relationship between a number and its neighbors
The numbers in the hexagonal spiral have a specific relationship with their neighbors, allowing us to calculate the neighbors of a given number without explicitly knowing their positions.

## Step 11: Apply the derived relationship to calculate the sum of neighbors of 2026
Using the derived relationship, we can calculate the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026.

## Step 12: Observe that the sum of neighbors for any number in the spiral can be calculated using its value and position
We can use the fact that the sum of the neighbors of a number in the hexagonal spiral can be calculated directly from the number itself and its position in the spiral.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8129}$
