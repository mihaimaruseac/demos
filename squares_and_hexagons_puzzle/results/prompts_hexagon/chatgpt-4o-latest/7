We are given a hexagonal spiral where numbers are placed in a hex grid starting at 1 in the center and spiraling outward. The pattern is such that each ring around the center forms a complete hexagon, and the total number of cells in the first \( n \) rings is:

\[
\text{Total cells} = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n-1)) = 1 + 3n(n-1)
\]

So:

- Ring 0 (center): 1
- Ring 1: 6 new numbers → up to 1 + 6 = 7
- Ring 2: 12 new numbers → up to 7 + 12 = 19
- Ring 3: 18 new numbers → up to 19 + 18 = 37
- etc.

The number of new numbers that are added in ring \( r \) is \( 6r \). So the maximum number in ring \( r \) is:

\[
M(r) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + r) = 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]

We want to know the neighbors of **2026** in this hexagonal spiral.

---

### Step 1: Find which ring 2026 is in.

We use:
\[
M(r) = 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]

We want the smallest \( r \) such that:
\[
1 + 3r(r+1) \geq 2026
\]

Subtracting 1:

\[
3r(r+1) \geq 2025 \Rightarrow r(r+1) \geq 675
\]

Trying values:
- \( r = 25 \): \( 25 \cdot 26 = 650 \) too small
- \( r = 26 \): \( 26 \cdot 27 = 702 \) good!

So 2026 is in ring **26**

Maximum value in ring 26 is:
\[
M(26) = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

Minimum value in ring 26 is:
\[
M(25) = 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

So the 26th ring has values from 1951 to 2107, total of 157 values (since \( 2107 - 1951 + 1 = 157 \))

---

The 26th ring has 6 sides, each with \( r = 26 \) values.

So starting from 1951, going around the hexagon, each side has exactly 26 consecutive numbers.

Now, to find the 6 neighbors of 2026, we need to find neighboring hex cells. In a regular hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors.

To find the neighbors of 2026, we can look at the pattern of the spiral.

Let’s enumerate the structure:

Position 1 is in the center. Then:

### Spiral Structure:

The hexagonal spiral adds numbers in a specific walking direction: each full layer (ring) is made up by walking in 6 directions forming the hexagon.

To find the 6 neighbors of a number like 2026, we can use the known property of the hex spiral numbers.

There's a known online problem about this same type of spiral, referenced in OEIS (OEIS A003215), and someone has reverse engineered a formula. But here, we'll take another approach.

We can look at the number **2026**, find its position in ring 26 (from 1 to 157), and determine its 6 neighbors.

Let’s compute how far into ring 26 it is:

We have:
- Ring 26 starts at 1951
- So \( 2026 - 1951 = 75 \), so it's the **76th** element in ring 26

Each side of the hexagon has 26 numbers

So:
- Side 1: positions 1 to 26 (1951 to 1976)
- Side 2: 27 to 52 (1977 to 2002)
- Side 3: 53 to 78 (2003 to 2028)
- Side 4: 79 to 104 (2029 to 2054)
- Side 5: 105 to 130 (2055 to 2080)
- Side 6: 131 to 156 (2081 to 2106)

(157 numbers total in ring 26)

So 2026 is on side **3**, position \( 2026 - 2003 = 23 \), so it's 24th number on that side.

(Positions are 2003 to 2028 on side 3)

Now, to find the neighbors of 2026, we need to find the numbers adjacent to it.

Each number on a ring has:

- 2 neighbors on the same ring (the previous and next numbers)
- 2 neighbors in the inner ring (i.e., ring 25)
- 2 neighbors in the outer ring (i.e., ring 27)

So 2 neighbors are 2025 and 2027 (adjacent in the ring)

Now let’s compute the corresponding neighbors in ring 25 and ring 27.

To determine which position in ring 25 lines up with 2026, we need to compute the starting index of side 3 in ring 25 and mirror the position.

Recall:

- Ring 25 has numbers from: \( M(24)+1 = 1801 \) to \( M(25) = 1950 \)
- Total: 150 values
- 6 sides, 25 per side

Side 3 of ring 25: positions 51 to 75 → values 1851 to 1875

We said 2026 is the 24th number on side 3 of ring 26, so ring 25 side 3 at same relative position would be 24th number → \( 1851 + 23 = 1874 \)

So one neighbor in ring 25 is **1874**

Similarly, likely the other neighbor in ring 25 is the 25th number, i.e. 1875

Also ring 27:

We can compute ring 27 values: from \( M(26)+1 = 2108 \) to \( M(27) = 1 + 3×27×28 = 1 + 2268 = 2269 \)

Total: 2269 – 2108 + 1 = 162 values

Each side: 27 values

Side 3: numbers from \( 2108 + 2 \cdot 27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162 \) onwards

Side 3 numbers: positions 55 to 81 → numbers 2162 to 2188

So 24th position on side 3: 2162 + 23 = **2185**

So ring 27 neighbor values are ~2184 and 2185

So 6 neighbors of 2026 are:

- In ring 26: 2025, 2027
- In ring 25: 1874, 1875
- In ring 27: 2184, 2185

### Sum:

\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052 \\
1874 + 1875 = 3749 \\
2184 + 2185 = 4369 \\
\text{Sum total} = 4052 + 3749 + 4369 = \boxed{12170}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{12170}
\]
