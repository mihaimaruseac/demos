We are given a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a **hexagonal grid**. The problem provides an example with a central number 1 and surrounding numbers increasing as we move outward in a spiral. Our task is to find the **sum of all 6 neighbors** of the number **2026** on this hexagonal spiral.

---

### Step 1: Understand the structure of the hexagonal spiral

A hexagonal grid spirals out starting from 1 in the center. The number of elements on each "ring" increases in a specific way. Specifically:

- Ring 0: 1 number → the center: 1
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (surrounding 1)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers
- Ring 3: 18 numbers
- Ring k: 6k numbers

So total numbers in all rings up to k:
\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
= 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

We can use this to determine which ring 2026 is in.

---

### Step 2: Determine the ring of 2026

Let’s solve for k such that:

\[
1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026
\]

Let’s try values:

- k = 25: 1 + 3×25×26 = 1 + 1950 + 1 = **1951**
- k = 26: 1 + 3×26×27 = 1 + 2106 = **2107**

So number 2026 is in **ring 26** (since 2026 ≤ 2107).

The numbers that are in ring 25 and inner lie below 1951.

So 2026 is the \((2026 - 1951) = 75\)-th number in ring 26.

Note: Each ring has 6 sides. Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers around its perimeter. So we number those from 1 to 156.

So 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26.

### Step 3: Determine 6 neighbors of a number in ring n

In a hex grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. The surroundings of a number in any ring are:
- Two neighbors in the same ring (previous and next on the same ring)
- Two neighbors in the inner ring (shared with two edges)
- Two neighbors in the outer ring (shared with two edges)

So if we can find the six neighbors of a number in ring **k** and position **p**, we can find their positions and compute their exact values.

Let’s define:
- Ring k has 6k elements
- The numbering of elements in ring k starts at index 0 and proceeds counterclockwise
- The first number in ring k is index 0 and equals:
  \[
  1 + 3(k-1)k
  \]
  (as derived earlier from total numbers before ring k)

Let’s compute:

- Value at start of ring 26 (k = 26):  
  \[
  \text{Start} = 1 + 3×25×26 = 1 + 1950 = **1951**
  \]

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 elements. So number 2026 is:
\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]
So it is at position 75 in ring 26.

---

### Step 4: Compute values of neighbors

Let’s try to compute the 6 neighbors of number 2026.

Position in ring 26: 75

**Neighbor 1 (same ring, previous)**

Previous position = (75 - 1) = 74  
Value = start of ring 26 + 74 = 1951 + 74 = **2025**

**Neighbor 2 (same ring, next)**

Next position = 76  
Value = 1951 + 76 = **2027**

Now we need to compute neighbors on inner ring (ring 25) and outer ring (ring 27). Let's first compute where ring 25 starts:

Start of ring 25:
\[
1 + 3×24×25 = 1 + 1800 = **1801**
\]
Ring 25 has 6×25 = 150 elements

How do we map position 75 in ring 26 to neighbors in ring 25?

Here's the useful trick: each ring has 6 equal-length sides. For ring 26 with 156 elements: 156 / 6 = 26 elements per side.

The 75th element lies on side:

\[
\text{Side} = \left\lfloor \frac{75}{26} \right\rfloor = 2 → third side (0-based indexing)
\]

Position on side = 75 % 26 = 75 mod 26 = **23**

So 2026 is the 24th element of the third side of ring 26

Similarly, we can get the corresponding positions in inner and outer ring.

**Ring 25 has 150 elements ⇒ 25 per side**
On same side (side 2), the 24th element is position 23 (0-based). So in ring 25, the matching positions would be:

- position_in_ring25 = side × 25 + 23 = 2×25 + 23 = 50 + 23 = **73**
- position +1 = 74

Ring 25 starts at **1801**

So two inner ring neighbors are:

- Inner neighbor 1 = 1801 + 73 = **1874**
- Inner neighbor 2 = 1801 + 74 = **1875**

Similarly, outer ring 27:
- Start of ring 27:  
  \[
  1 + 3×26×27 = 1 + 2106 = **2107**
  \]

- Ring 27 has 6×27 = 162 numbers ⇒ 27 per side

We find on side 2, element 23 maps to:

- position_in_ring27 = 2×27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = **77**
- position +1 = 78

So outer neighbors:

- Outer neighbor 1 = 2107 + 77 = **2184**
- Outer neighbor 2 = 2107 + 78 = **2185**

Now list of all 6 neighbors of 2026:

- Same ring: 2025, 2027  
- Inner ring: 1874, 1875  
- Outer ring: 2184, 2185

So the **sum** is:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1875 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Let's compute step-by-step:

- 2025 + 2027 = 4052  
- 1874 + 1875 = 3749  
- 2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now total sum:

\[
4052 + 3749 = 7801  
7801 + 4369 = \boxed{12170}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12170}
\]
