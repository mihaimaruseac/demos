We are given a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a **hexagonal grid**. On such a grid, each cell has **6 neighbors**.

We are told that 1 is in the center, with values increasing outwards in a spiral pattern.

We’re asked: **What is the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the structure

We observe the miniature pattern provided:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this structure:
- Number **1** is at the center.
- Surrounding the center are numbers **2–7**, forming the first ring.
- Then comes **8–19**, the second ring, and so on.

That way, we can define:

| Ring | Start Number | Count of Numbers | End Number |
|------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| 0    | 1            | 1                | 1          |
| 1    | 2            | 6                | 7          |
| 2    | 8            | 12               | 19         |
| 3    | 20           | 18               | 37         |
| 4    | 38           | 24               | 61         |
| ...  | ...          | ...              | ...        |

In general:
- Ring \( r \) has \( 6r \) numbers.
- Starting number of ring \( r \):  
  \[
  S_r = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{r-1} 6k = 1 + 3r(r-1)
  \]
- Ending number of ring \( r \):  
  \[
  E_r = S_r + 6r - 1 = 1 + 3r^2 + 3r - 1 = 3r^2 + 3r
  \]

---

### Step 2: Find which ring contains 2026

We solve for \( r \) such that:

\[
3r^2 + 3r \ge 2026
\]

Dividing through:

\[
r^2 + r \ge \frac{2026}{3} \approx 675.33
\]

Solving \( r^2 + r - 675.33 = 0 \)

Use quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1^2 + 4 \cdot 675.33}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701.33}}{2} ≈ \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} ≈ 25.5
\]

So \( r = 26 \) would contain 2026 (since we need \( r \) large enough so the ring includes 2026).

Check:

- Start of ring 26:
  \[
  S_{26} = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
  \]
- End of ring 26:
  \[
  E_{26} = S_{26} + 156 - 1 = 1951 + 155 = 2106
  \]

So number 2026 is in ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Use previous pattern

Let’s look at the center of the spiral again:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Look at cell 7. Its six neighbors are:
- 6, 16, 8, 2, 1, 5

**Sum of neighbors of 7:**

\[
6 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 38
\]

Therefore, neighbors of 7 sum to 38.

Does this help?

Let’s consider the center cell, 1. Its neighbors are:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 → sum = 27

Let’s test for 19:

Not straightforward.

Alternately, revisit the center: Ring 0 is 1  
- 6 neighbors sum to 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27

Ring 1: numbers 2–7

For each number in the inner rings, the 6 neighbors are arranged around them similarly.

For numbers deep inside the spiral, we can observe that **every cell has 6 neighbors**, and these neighbors can be calculated if we know the hex coordinates.

---

### Step 4: Use coordinate system

Let’s use **axial coordinates** for hex grids.

In a flat-topped hex grid, every cell has coordinates (q, r), and the six directions are:

- (1, 0)
- (1, -1)
- (0, -1)
- (-1, 0)
- (-1, 1)
- (0, 1)

If we can compute the coordinates of the number 2026, then compute the coordinates of its 6 neighbors, we can find the numbers at those positions and sum them.

However, there's a shortcut!

---

### Step 5: Key Insight about hex spiral

Let’s look again at the number 1.

Number 1 is at center, and its 6 neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 → sum = 27

Number 19 (corner of ring 2) has 6 neighbors: 18, 8, 7, 6, 17, 20 (?) → sum = ?

Alternatively, go back to the example.

Given in the diagram:

Number 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (sum: 27)  
Number 7 has neighbors: 6, 16, 8, 2, 1, 5 (sum: 38)

So, **number 7** has neighbors:  
6, 16, 8, 2, 1, 5

Check the sum:

6 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 5 = **38**

So **sum of neighbors of 7 is 38**

Now, the middle value, 7, is in ring 2

Look at the hex ring: in ring 2 (number 8–19), number 13 is a "middle" of one side.  
Then 14 is a corner, 15 next, etc.

Looking at how the hexagonal spiral increases, we can see that **numbers with the same relative position in their ring** must have the **same neighbor pattern**, just with higher values.

---

### Step 6: Determine position of 2026 in ring 26

Earlier, we saw:
- Ring 26 starts at 1951
- Ring 26 has 156 numbers (because \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \))
- So positions go from 0 to 155

So:

- 2026 – 1951 = 75 → position 75 within ring 26

Positions along the sides (since 156 ÷ 6 = 26 per side)

So side = floor(75 ÷ 26) = 2 (0-based indexing → side 0 is first side)

Offset in side = 75 – (2*26) = 23 (i.e., the 24th number along side 3)

So 2026 is the 24th number along the third side of ring 26.

Likewise, **number 7 is the 1st number on side 1 of ring 1**, as per the initial diagram.

Looking back:
- 7 has neighbors: 6, 16, 8, 2, 1, 5
→ So three are in inner ring, some same ring, one outer ring.

If we accept rotational symmetry and distance preservation in hex spiral, then we can assert:

**2026 occupies the same relative position in ring 26 as 7 does in ring 1.**

→ Therefore, the neighbor numbers of 2026 are:

- (2026 – ring offset for 7) + values of neighbors of 7

So if 7’s neighbors are:

6, 16, 8, 2, 1, 5

Then the neighbor delta values (compared to 7) are:

-1 (6), +9 (16), +1 (8), -5 (2), -6 (1), -2 (5)

So deltas:

-1, +9, +1, -5, -6, -2

Therefore, applying these to 2026:

2026 -1 = 2025  
2026 +9 = 2035  
2026 +1 = 2027  
2026 -5 = 2021  
2026 -6 = 2020  
2026 -2 = 2024

So neighbors of 2026 are:

**2020, 2021, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2035**

Sum:

\[
2020 + 2021 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2035 = ?
\]

Break it down:

- 2020 + 2021 = 4041  
- 2024 + 2025 = 4049  
- 2027 + 2035 = 4062

Add totals:

4041 + 4049 = 8090  
8090 + 4062 = **12152**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{12152}
\]
