We are given a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a hexagonal grid. Each number has at most 6 neighbors (since in a hex grid each cell has 6 neighbors), and we are told to find the *sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.*

Let’s first understand the structure of the hexagonal spiral. The layout resembles a spiral growing outward in concentric hexagonal rings.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Hex Spiral Pattern

Let’s label the rings:

- **Level 0:** Center (number 1)
- **Level 1:** 6 numbers surrounding 1 → numbers 2–7
- **Level 2:** 12 numbers surrounding level 1 → numbers 8–19
- **Level 3:** 18 numbers → numbers 20–37
- … and so on.

Each level \( n \) has \( 6n \) numbers (Q: Confirm this general formula):

- The first number in ring \( n \) is:
  \[
  1 + 6(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 3n(n-1)
  \]

So the first few rings:

- Level 0: 1 number → 1
- Level 1: starts at 2, ends at 7 (2 + 6 - 1)
- Level 2: starts at 8 = 1 + 6(1) = 7 + 1, ends at 19 (8 + 12 - 1)
- Level 3: starts at 20 = 1 + 6(1+2) = 1 + 18 = 19 + 1
- Level 4: ...

So the general formula for the **starting number** \( S(n) \) at level \( n \):

\[
S(n) = 1 + 3n(n - 1)
\]

Let’s find which ring 2026 is in.

Find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
S(n) \leq 2026 < S(n+1) \Rightarrow
1 + 3n(n-1) \leq 2026 < 1 + 3(n+1)n
\]

Let’s compute \( S(n) \) for increasing \( n \):

- \( n=1 \): \( 1 + 3×0 = 1 \)
- \( n=2 \): \( 1 + 3×1 = 4 \)
- \( n=3 \): \( 1 + 3×2 = 7 \)
- \( n=4 \): \( 1 + 3×3 = 10 \)
- ...
Calculate until \( S(n) \leq 2026 \)

Since \( S(n) = 1 + 3n(n-1) \), approximate:

Let’s solve:

\[
1 + 3n(n - 1) \leq 2026
\Rightarrow
3n(n - 1) \leq 2025
\Rightarrow
n(n - 1) \leq 675
\]

Try small values:

- \( n=25 \): \( 25×24 = 600 \) → OK
- \( n=26 \): \( 26×25 = 650 \) → OK
- \( n=27 \): \( 27×26 = 702 \) → Too much

So level 26

- \( S(26) = 1 + 3×26×25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \)
- \( S(27) = 1 + 3×27×26 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \)

So level 26 has numbers from:
**1951 to 2106**

That includes 2026. It's at position:
\[
2026 - 1951 = 75^{\text{th}} \text{ number in level 26}
\]

Level 26 has \( 6×26 = 156 \) numbers.

So positions in ring are numbered 0 to 155.

So 2026 is at index 75 in a ring of 156.

### Step 2: Find neighbors of 2026

Each number in a hex spiral (except center) has 6 neighbors.

In particular, each number has 2 neighbors in the same ring (the numbers before and after in the ring), and 2 from the ring inside (level 25), and 2 from the ring outside (level 27).

Let’s denote this positional info:

- **Level**: \( r = 26 \)
- **Index within level**: \( i = 75 \)
- Total number in ring: \( N_r = 6r = 156 \)

The neighboring indexes are:

- **Same level**: indexes \( i-1 \), \( i+1 \) mod 156 → indexes 74 and 76
→ Numbers at level 26: starting from 1951, so:
  - 74th index: \( 1951 + 74 = 2025 \)
  - 76th index: \( 1951 + 76 = 2027 \)

So two neighbors are **2025** and **2027**

Now, find the **two inner ring neighbors**:

- Level 25: has \( 6×25 = 150 \) numbers
- Index mapping depends on the structure of the hex

Because of the nature of hexagonal tiling, the mapping of inner/outer ring neighbors to a given index \( i \) cycles proportionally.

Let’s compute the mapping of index \( i \) in level 26 to inner level 25:

We map index \( i = 75 \) in level 26 to index \( j \) in level 25 (150 elements), as:

Proportional mapping:

\[
j = \left\lfloor \frac{150}{156} × i \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{26} × 75 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 72.115... \right\rfloor = 72
\]

So in inner ring (level 25), one neighbor is index 72.

Its corresponding number is:

- Start of level 25: \( S(25) = 1 + 3×25×24 = 1 + 1800 = 1801 \)
- So number: \( 1801 + 72 = 1873 \)

Other inner neighbor is usually the next index: 73 → 1801 + 73 = **1874**

So two inner neighbors: **1873** and **1874**

Now outer neighbors—in level 27

Level 27 has \( 6×27 = 162 \) numbers
Start at \( S(27) = 2107 \)

Map index \( i = 75 \) in level 26 to indices in level 27:

\[
j = \left\lfloor \frac{162}{156} × 75 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{27}{26} × 75 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 77.88 \right\rfloor = 77
\]

So outer neighbors: likely 77 and 78 → numbers:

- \( 2107 + 77 = 2184 \)
- \( 2107 + 78 = 2185 \)

Thus, the six neighbors:

- Same level: 2025, 2027
- Inner level: 1873, 1874
- Outer level: 2184, 2185

**Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185}
\]

Let’s compute:

- 2025 + 2027 = 4052
- 1873 + 1874 = 3747
- 2184 + 2185 = 4369

Sum:

\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799 \\
7799 + 4369 = \boxed{12168}
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]
