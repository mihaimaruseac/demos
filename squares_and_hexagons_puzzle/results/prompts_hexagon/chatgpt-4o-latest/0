We are given a number spiral laid out on a **hexagonal grid**, and asked to find the **sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026**.

Let’s first analyze the pattern of the hexagonal spiral.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

From the diagram, the spiral starts at 1 in the center and proceeds in a counter-clockwise direction, wrapping in hexagonal rings.

We can write out the pattern:

#### Ring 0 (center):
- 1

#### Ring 1:
- 2 to 7 (6 numbers)

#### Ring 2:
- 8 to 19 (12 numbers)

So, the total number of elements in ring *n* is:
\[
\text{Total in ring } n = 6n
\]
And the total number of elements from all previous rings up to ring *n* is:
\[
T(n) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

Hence:
- Ring 0 ends at 1
- Ring 1 ends at \(1 + 6 = 7\)
- Ring 2 ends at \(7 + 12 = 19\)
- Ring 3 ends at \(19 + 18 = 37\)
- Ring 4 ends at \(37 + 24 = 61\)
- Ring 5 ends at \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- Ring 6 ends at \(91 + 36 = 127\)
- And so on

We can use the total number through ring \(n\), \(T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)\)

We want to find in which ring the number **2026** is located.

---

### Step 2: Determine Which Ring 2026 Is In

We solve:
\[
1 + 3n(n+1) \geq 2026
\Rightarrow 3n(n+1) \geq 2025
\Rightarrow n(n+1) \geq 675
\]

Try \(n = 25\):
\[
25 \cdot 26 = 650
\]

Try \(n = 26\):
\[
26 \cdot 27 = 702 > 675
\]

So **2026 is in ring 26**

And total numbers up to ring 25:
\[
T(25) = 1 + 3\cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

So the first number in ring 26 is **1952**, and ring 26 has:
\[
6 \cdot 26 = 156 \text{ numbers}
\]

So in ring 26:
- 1952 (first), up to \(1952 + 155 = 2107\)

So **2026** is the \((2026 - 1952 + 1) = 75\)-th number in ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Understanding the Neighbor Structure

Each number has up to 6 neighbors. For numbers that lie in the middle of the spiral (i.e., not on the corners), it usually has 6 neighbors unless on an outer edge.

Each number in the spiral has neighbors located:
- Either in the same ring,
- Inner ring,
- Outer ring.

Let’s denote the k-th number in ring \(n\) as \(R(n,k)\), where \(1 \leq k \leq 6n\)

Adjacent neighbors will include:
- Possibly two in the same ring (k ± 1 modulo 6n)
- Possibly two in the inner ring (mapping to nearby positions)
- Possibly two in the outer ring (mapping to nearby positions)

We need to find all 6 neighbors of number 2026 \(= R(26, 75)\)

---

### Step 4: Find the 6 Neighbors of 2026 = R(26, 75)

- First, recall from earlier:
  - Inner ring = 25 (has 150 numbers) → numbers from 1802 to 1951
  - Outer ring = 27 (has 162 numbers) → numbers from 2108 to 2269

We compute:

#### Neighbor 1: Same ring, previous (k–1)
- k = 75 → k–1 = 74
- Number = 1952 + (74 – 1) = **2025**

#### Neighbor 2: Same ring, next (k+1)
- k+1 = 76
- Number = 1952 + (76 – 1) = **2026** (already given), so neighbor is:
- 1952 + (76 – 1) = **2027**

#### Neighbors 3 & 4: Inner ring

We map position k = 75 in ring 26 to the inner ring (ring 25 of size 150).

We can estimate:

\[
\text{Position in ring 25} = \left\lfloor \frac{75}{156} \cdot 150 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.4808 \cdot 150 \right\rfloor = 72
\]

So neighbor:
- Inner ring neighbor 1: position 72 → number = 1802 + (72 – 1) = **1873**
- Inner ring neighbor 2: position 73 → number = 1802 + 72 = **1874**

#### Neighbors 5 & 6: Outer ring

Outer ring (ring 27) has 162 numbers, starting at 2108

Map position:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{75}{156} \cdot 162 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.4808 \cdot 162 \right\rfloor = \lfloor 77.5 \rfloor = 77
\]

Outer ring neighbor 1 = number at position 77 → 2108 + 76 = **2184**

Outer ring neighbor 2 = position 78 → number = 2108 + 77 = **2185**

---

**List of the 6 neighbors of 2026**:
- 2025
- 2027
- 1873
- 1874
- 2184
- 2185

### Step 5: Sum Them
\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052  
\]
\[
1873 + 1874 = 3747
\]
\[
2184 + 2185 = 4369
\]

Total:
\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799  
\]
\[
7799 + 4369 = \boxed{12168}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12168}
\]
