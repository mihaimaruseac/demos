We are given a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a **hexagonal grid**, and asked to compute the **sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026** in this spiral.

### Step 1: Understanding the Hex Grid Spiral

From the diagram:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, it is apparent that the spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward clockwise (or counterclockwise) on a **hexagonal grid**, placing each natural number in successive hex cells.

Hexagonal grids have 6 neighbors for each cell (except possibly at the edges), and their spiral structure grows in hexagonal rings. Here's how the rings are formed:

- Center: ring 0 → contains just number 1  
- Ring 1 (surrounding the center): 6 numbers (2 through 7)  
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8 through 19)  
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20 through 37)  
- Ring 4: 24 numbers (38 through 61)  
- ...

The pattern is that:
- Each ring r (r ≥ 1) contains **6 × r** numbers.
- The total number of cells up through ring r is:  
  \[
  1 + \sum_{k=1}^{r} 6k = 1 + 3r(r+1)
  \]
  
So, we want to:

1. Figure out in which ring 2026 lies.
2. Identify its position on that ring.
3. Find its neighbors (which are at adjacent positions on the hex ring).
4. Sum the 6 neighboring values.

### Step 2: Find Which Ring 2026 Is In

We can use the formula for total cells up through ring \( r \):

\[
\text{Max number up through ring } r = 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]

We want the smallest \( r \) such that:

\[
1 + 3r(r+1) \geq 2026
\]

Let’s solve for \( r \):

\[
3r(r+1) \geq 2025  
\Rightarrow r(r+1) \geq 675
\]

Try testing values:

- \( r = 25 \): \( 25 × 26 = 650 \)
- \( r = 26 \): \( 26 × 27 = 702 \)

So, the smallest ring \( r \) such that the 2026-th number is in that ring is \( r = 26 \)

Check how many numbers are before ring 26:

\[
\text{Total before ring 26} = 1 + 3 × 25 × 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

So, **the first number in ring 26 is 1952**, and the ring has \( 6 × 26 = 156 \) numbers:

- Ring 26 numbers: 1952 to 2107 inclusive

Therefore, **2026 is at position**:

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74 \text{ (starting count from 0)}
\]

So it's the **75th number on ring 26** (position 74, 0-based)

---

### Step 3: Hex Ring Structure – Finding Neighbors

Each cell on a hex ring has **6 neighbors**:

- 2 neighbors are **on the same ring** (previous and next)
- 2 neighbors are on the **inner ring** (r − 1)
- 2 neighbors are on the **outer ring** (r + 1)

We already computed:

- Inner ring (r=25): starts at number:
  \[
  1 + 3 × (25)(24) = 1 + 1800 = 1801
  \]
  and contains 150 numbers (6×25)

- Outer ring (r=27): starts at
  \[
  1 + 3×26×27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
  \]
  and contains 6×27=162 numbers

We now need to find the 6 neighbors of 2026:

- **Same ring neighbors:** positions 73 and 75 → values:
  - 1952 + 73 = 2025  
  - 1952 + 75 = 2027

- **Inner ring (r=25)** has 150 numbers. For position in inner ring:
  Since both rings are aligned, we divide the ring into 6 sides and interpolate.

  For ring r, side length = r.
  
There are **6 sides**, each of length r, so positions 0 to 155 (for ring 26), and positions 0 to 149 (for ring 25)

Assuming each cell’s position on ring r corresponds to a same-angle point on ring r-1 and r+1 (approximately), we can find inner and outer positions.

Let’s compute corresponding position on inner ring (r=25):

\[
\text{Inner position index} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{26} × 74 \right\rfloor \approx 71.15 → 71
\]

Value at that position:

\[
1801 + 71 = \boxed{1872}
\]

(Another one near this is at position 72 → 1801 + 72 = 1873)

So:

- Inner neighbors: 1872, 1873

Similarly for **outer ring** (r=27) with 162 numbers:

\[
\text{Outer position index} = \left\lfloor \frac{27}{26} × 74 \right\rfloor ≈ 76.85 → 76
\]

So outer neighbors:

- 2107 + 76 = 2183  
- 2107 + 77 = 2184

### Step 4: Add All 6 Neighbors:

We have:

- Same ring: 2025, 2027  
- Inner ring: 1872, 1873  
- Outer ring: 2183, 2184

Now sum:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2183 + 2184
\]

Group:

- (2025 + 2027) = 4052  
- (1872 + 1873) = 3745  
- (2183 + 2184) = 4367

Total sum:

\[
4052 + 3745 = 7797  
7797 + 4367 = \boxed{12164}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{12164}
\]
