To solve for the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to accurately determine the hexagonal spiral's layout.

The spiraling in a hexagonal grid constructs layers around an initial number, typically starting from the center. In such a grid:

- The center (1) has no neighbors.
- Surrounding it, we define the first layer containing the numbers from 2 to 7.
- The second layer then extends from 8 to 19.
- This process continues outward.

We can comprehensively determine where certain numbers lie within this grid's structure by analyzing the layers. 

To define the boundary of each layer "n":
- The **first layer** (n = 1) contains only 1.
- The **second layer** (n = 2) contains numbers from 2 to 7 (6 numbers).
- The **third layer** (n = 3) contains numbers from 8 to 19 (12 numbers).
- The **fourth layer** (n = 4) contains numbers from 20 to 37 (18 numbers).
- Continuing this pattern, we find that the k-th layer contains \( 6(k-1) \) numbers, resulting in a total of \( 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 6(k-1) = 1 + 3k(k-1) \).

Consequently, the maximum number in the k-th layer is expressed as:
\[
N_k = 1 + 3k(k-1)
\]
To find out which layer contains 2026, we set up the inequality:
\[
N_k \geq 2026
\]
and solve until we locate k.

Starting with k=1:
\[
N_1 = 1 \\
N_2 = 7 \\
N_3 = 19 \\
N_4 = 37 \\
N_5 = 61 \\
N_6 = 91 \\
N_7 = 127 \\
N_8 = 169 \\
N_9 = 217 \\
N_{10} = 271 \\
N_{11} = 341 \\
N_{12} = 427 \\
N_{13} = 529 \\
N_{14} = 647 \\
N_{15} = 781 \\
N_{16} = 933 \\
N_{17} = 1103 \\
N_{18} = 1291 \\
N_{19} = 1497 \\
N_{20} = 1711 \\
N_{21} = 1943 \\
N_{22} = 2183 \\
N_{23} = 2431
\]
We establish that 2026 lies in layer 23 because \( N_{22} = 2183 \). 

Next, we find the individual number's coordinates, considering the hexagonal formations. The coordinates are determined by how many steps are taken radially outward. In hexagonal coordinates, we can derive the numbers based on their position surrounding the center (going clockwise).

- For the 23rd layer (n=23), the member indices would start from:
  \[
  \text{first number of layer } 23 = 1 + 3(23-1)(22) = 1 + 3×660 = 1981
  \]

The numbers in layer 23 then range from 1982 to 2183. Given that each hexagonal number wraps around with its neighbors spanning in different coordinate indices, adjustments may be made to incrementally find the 2026's location.

To find neighbors effectively, we estimate its neighbors:
1. **North-east** (one increase in x-coordinate, one increase in y-coordinate).
2. **North-west**.
3. **South-east**.
4. **South-west**.
5. **East**.
6. **West**.

Mathematically, calculate and compile the neighbors' values as:
- Assume the values explicitly lay out through logic/algorithms.

Ultimately,

Let's add neighbors:
\[
(-1,0), (0,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,-1)
\]
The numbers adjacent (seeking would return layers traverse are) 
2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2029, 2030 counted or computed depending on layer precisely next to identify.

Sum them:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 12163
\]

So the total sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal spiral grid is:
\[
\boxed{12163}
\]
