To solve the problem, we first need to identify the position of the number \(2026\) in a hexagonal spiral and then determine its six neighbors. 

The arrangement of numbers in a hexagonal spiral has a specific pattern:

- The center starts with \(1\).
- The first layer around \(1\) contains the numbers \(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).
- The second layer has \(8\) to \(19\) (12 additional numbers).
- The third layer has \(20\) to \(37\) (24 additional numbers).
- Similarly, subsequent layers continue to add more numbers in the same pattern.

Each layer \(n\) consists of \(6n\) numbers:
- Layer \(0\) (the center) has \(1\).
- Layer \(1\) has \(6\) numbers.
- Layer \(2\) has \(12\) numbers.
- Layer \(3\) has \(18\) numbers.
- Layer \(4\) has \(24\) numbers.
- As such, layer \(n\) has a total of \(\sum_{k=0}^{n} 6k = 3n(n+1)\) numbers in total including all previous layers.

To find the layer in which \(2026\) resides, we need to solve:
\[
1 + 3n(n + 1) \geq 2026.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3n(n + 1) \geq 2025.
\]
Dividing through by \(3\):
\[
n(n + 1) \geq 675.
\]

To estimate \(n\), we can try \(n = 25\):
\[
25 \times 26 = 650 \quad \text{(not enough)}
\]

Then we try \(n = 26\):
\[
26 \times 27 = 702 \quad \text{(sufficient)}
\]

Thus, \(n = 26\) is the correct layer. Let's determine how many numbers are there until layer \(n = 25\):
\[
1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951.
\]
Thus, the numbers \(1952\) through \(2026\) are in layer \(26\), starting from \(1952\).

Since layer \(26\) spans numbers from \(1952\) to \(2026\), we know:
- \(2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75\) (meaning \(2026\) is the \(75\)th number in layer \(26\)).

In this hexagonal arrangement, the numbers in this layer can be represented based on their angular coordinate (direction). Each corner of the layer has numbers in a specific pattern:
- Starting from the first position \(1952\) (the \(0\) angle), the positions can then be labeled:
  - Right from \(1952\), up, left, down, right-dowards, and down-left, each angle contributing numbers.

Next, we can find the specific coordinates or the layout:
\[
\text{Layer 26: }
\begin{align*}
& \quad \text{1952} \quad \text{1953} \quad \ldots \quad \text{1962} \\
& \text{1963} \quad \text{1964} \quad \text{...} \quad 1973 \\
& \quad \text{1974} \quad \ldots \quad \text{1988} \\
& \text{...}
\end{align*}
\]

Given the pattern and its structure, we specifically find:
- The six neighboring values can be computed based on positions surrounding \(2026\).

After careful consideration and layout, we find:
1. The neighbors of \(2026\) are numeric from:
   - \(2025\) (left)
   - \(2024\) (up left)
   - \(2027\) (down-right)
   - \(2028\) (down-left)
   - \(2029\) (up-right)
   - \(2030\) (right)
   
Assuming positions were correctly identified in the layout, the neighbors yield the actual values:
\[
2025, 2024, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030
\]

Now, we sum these neighbors:
\[
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 12163
\]

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{12163}
\]
