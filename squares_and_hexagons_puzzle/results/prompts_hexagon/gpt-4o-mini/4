To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal spiral grid, we first need to determine the number's position within the grid. 

The hexagonal spiral is structured such that the center is 1, and as you spiral outwards, the numbers increase in a counter-clockwise manner around the hexagonal layers. Each layer adds additional numbers on the outer hexagonal boundary.

### Step 1: Identifying the layer containing 2026

The first step in the solution is to determine which layer (or "ring") the number 2026 is in. The total count of numbers in each layer follows the pattern:

- Layer 0 (the center): 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8 to 19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20 to 37)
- Layer 4: 24 numbers (38 to 61)
- ...

From this, we observe that the number of elements in layer \( n \) is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Count} = 3n(n + 1) + 1
\]

This counts 1 for the central number and \( 6n \) for the surrounding layers.

To find the highest number in each layer, we can rearrange and calculate:

\[
\text{Max number in layer } n = 3n^2 + 3n + 1
\]

Calculating iteratively for increasing values of \( n \):

- \( n = 0 \): Max = 1
- \( n = 1 \): Max = 7
- \( n = 2 \): Max = 19
- \( n = 3 \): Max = 37
- \( n = 4 \): Max = 61
- \( n = 5 \): Max = 91
- \( n = 6 \): Max = 127
- \( n = 7 \): Max = 169
- \( n = 8 \): Max = 217
- \( n = 9 \): Max = 271
- \( n = 10 \): Max = 331
- \( n = 11 \): Max = 397
- \( n = 12 \): Max = 469
- \( n = 13 \): Max = 547
- \( n = 14 \): Max = 631
- \( n = 15 \): Max = 721
- \( n = 16 \): Max = 817
- \( n = 17 \): Max = 919
- \( n = 18 \): Max = 1027
- \( n = 19 \): Max = 1141
- \( n = 20 \): Max = 1261
- \( n = 21 \): Max = 1387
- \( n = 22 \): Max = 1519
- \( n = 23 \): Max = 1657
- \( n = 24 \): Max = 1801
- \( n = 25 \): Max = 1951
- \( n = 26 \): Max = 2117

From this, we find that 2026 lies within layer 26, since \( 1951 < 2026 < 2117 \).

### Step 2: Identifying the position of 2026 in layer 26

The first number in layer 26 is 1952, so the numbers in layer 26 range from 1952 to 2117. We can calculate the exact index of 2026 in layer 26:

\[
2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75
\]

This means that 2026 is the 75th number in that layer.

### Step 3: Finding the neighbors

The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal grid can be represented as follows:

- \( \text{North-East} \)
- \( \text{North-West} \)
- \( \text{West} \)
- \( \text{East} \)
- \( \text{South-East} \)
- \( \text{South-West} \)

In layer 26, the structured arrangement of the numbers allows us to find the neighbors of 2026 easily by observing the pattern.

Using the layout, we can find the 6 adjacent numbers to 2026 in layer 26:

- Assume numbering runs counter-clockwise, and manually trace the neighboring sequence:
  
  - 2025 (West)
  - 2024 (South-West)
  - 2027 (East)
  - 2028 (North-East)
  - 2029 (North-West)
  - 2030 (South-East)

### Step 4: Sum of the neighbors

The full neighbors of 2026 become:
- 2025
- 2024
- 2027
- 2028
- 2029
- 2030

Calculating the sum:
\[
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 12163
\]

Thus, the result is:
\[
\boxed{12163}
\]
