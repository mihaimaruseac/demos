To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, we first need to identify the position of the number 2026 in the hexagonal grid pattern.

The pattern in a hexagonal grid can be described as follows:

1. At the center (layer 0) is 1.
2. Layer 1 contains the numbers 2 to 7.
3. Layer 2 contains the numbers from 8 to 19.
4. Layer 3 contains the numbers from 20 to 37.
5. Layer 4 contains the numbers from 38 to 61, and so on.

Each layer \( n \) contains \( 6n \) numbers. Therefore:

- Total numbers up to layer 0: 1
- Total numbers up to layer 1: \( 1 + 6 = 7 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 2: \( 7 + 12 = 19 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 3: \( 19 + 18 = 37 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 4: \( 37 + 24 = 61 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 5: \( 61 + 30 = 91 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 6: \( 91 + 36 = 127 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 7: \( 127 + 42 = 169 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 8: \( 169 + 48 = 217 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 9: \( 217 + 54 = 271 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 10: \( 271 + 60 = 331 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 11: \( 331 + 66 = 397 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 12: \( 397 + 72 = 469 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 13: \( 469 + 78 = 547 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 14: \( 547 + 84 = 631 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 15: \( 631 + 90 = 721 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 16: \( 721 + 96 = 817 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 17: \( 817 + 102 = 919 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 18: \( 919 + 108 = 1027 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 19: \( 1027 + 114 = 1141 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 20: \( 1141 + 120 = 1261 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 21: \( 1261 + 126 = 1387 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 22: \( 1387 + 132 = 1519 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 23: \( 1519 + 138 = 1657 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 24: \( 1657 + 144 = 1801 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 25: \( 1801 + 150 = 1951 \)
- Total numbers up to layer 26: \( 1951 + 156 = 2107 \)

From here, we can see that 2026 lies between layer 25 (1951 and 2107). This indicates that 2026 is in layer 26.

To find out the exact position of 2026 within layer 26, we calculate:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

This means that 2026 is the 75th number in the layer 26, and the first number of layer 26 is 1952.

Now, the first number in layer 26 can be analyzed in terms of the structure of the hexagonal spiral. The layout of numbers in layer \( n \) can be expressed in counter-clockwise order starting from the topmost point of the hexagon.

The structure of positions around 2026 consists of six neighbors:
- (75 - 1)
- (75 + 1)
- (75 + 6) (next layer "side" at the same index)
- (75 - 6)
- (75 + 5) (the previous layer's clockwise neighbor)
- (75 - 5) (the previous layer's counterclockwise neighbor)

As such, assuming the numbering of 2026:

The neighbors include numbers calculated as follows:
- 2025
- 2027
- 2029
- 2023
- 2031
- 2019

The sum of these numbers can be computed:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2029 + 2023 + 2031 + 2019
\]

Calculating the sum:
- Pair the numbers for simplification:
  - \( 2025 + 2031 = 4056 \)
  - \( 2027 + 2029 = 4056 \)
  - \( 2023 + 2019 = 4042 \)

Thus the result will be:
\[
4056 + 4056 + 4042 = 12154
\]

So the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{12154}
\]
