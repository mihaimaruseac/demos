To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, we first determine its position in the grid.

1.  **Identify the Ring:**
    The last number of the $n$-th ring (where the center 1 is ring 0) is given by the formula $E_n = 3n(n+1) + 1$.
    Checking values for $n$:
    For $n=25$, $E_{25} = 3(25)(26) + 1 = 1950 + 1 = 1951$.
    For $n=26$, $E_{26} = 3(26)(27) + 1 = 2106 + 1 = 2107$.
    Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is located in **Ring 26**.

2.  **Identify the Position within the Ring:**
    The $n$-th ring has $6n$ numbers, divided into 6 sides of length $n$. The corners of the $n$-th ring are at values $C_{k,n} = E_{n-1} + k \cdot n$ for $k=1, \dots, 6$.
    For Ring 26:
    $C_{1,26} = 1951 + 26 = 1977$
    $C_{2,26} = 1977 + 26 = 2003$
    $C_{3,26} = 2003 + 26 = 2029$
    
    The number 2026 is close to the 3rd corner ($C_{3,26} = 2029$).
    $2026 = 2029 - 3$.
    This means 2026 is on the 3rd side of Ring 26, positioned 3 steps back from Corner 3. Since it is not a corner itself, it has the standard configuration of neighbors: 2 in the same ring, 2 in the inner ring, and 2 in the outer ring.

3.  **Find the Neighbors:**
    Let $X = 2026$. The neighbors in the same ring are $X-1$ and $X+1$.
    *   $N_{same} = 2025, 2027$. Sum = 4052.

    **Inner Ring (Ring 25):**
    The corresponding corner in Ring 25 is $C_{3,25} = E_{24} + 3(25)$.
    $E_{24} = 3(24)(25) + 1 = 1801$.
    $C_{3,25} = 1801 + 75 = 1876$.
    Because the side length decreases by 1 in the inner ring, the neighbors of a number located $k=3$ steps from the corner $C_{3,26}$ will be located $k-1=2$ and $k=3$ steps from the corner $C_{3,25}$.
    *   $N_{in,1} = C_{3,25} - 2 = 1876 - 2 = 1874$.
    *   $N_{in,2} = C_{3,25} - 3 = 1876 - 3 = 1873$.
    Sum = $1874 + 1873 = 3747$.

    **Outer Ring (Ring 27):**
    The corresponding corner in Ring 27 is $C_{3,27} = E_{26} + 3(27)$.
    $E_{26} = 2107$.
    $C_{3,27} = 2107 + 81 = 2188$.
    Because the side length increases by 1 in the outer ring, the neighbors of a number located $k=3$ steps from the corner $C_{3,26}$ will be located $k=3$ and $k+1=4$ steps from the corner $C_{3,27}$.
    *   $N_{out,1} = C_{3,27} - 3 = 2188 - 3 = 2185$.
    *   $N_{out,2} = C_{3,27} - 4 = 2188 - 4 = 2184$.
    Sum = $2185 + 2184 = 4369$.

4.  **Calculate the Total Sum:**
    Total Sum = $4052 + 3747 + 4369 = 12168$.
    
    (Alternatively, using the formula for non-corner numbers: $Sum = 6X + 12$.
    $6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.)

Answer: 12168
