To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

The hexagonal grid is filled in layers. Layer 0 contains only the number 1. Layer $k$ (for $k \ge 1$) contains $6k$ numbers. The last number of Layer $k$ is given by the formula:
$L_k = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 3k(k+1)$.

We find the layer $k$ such that $L_{k-1} < 2026 \le L_k$.
For $k=25$, $L_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1951$.
For $k=26$, $L_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is in Layer 26.

Layer $k$ consists of 6 segments (sides). The length of the first side is $k-1$, and the lengths of the subsequent 5 sides are $k$.
The starting numbers of the sides in Layer 26 are:
- Start of Layer 26 ($S_{26}$): $L_{25} + 1 = 1952$.
- Corner 1: $1952 + (26-1) = 1977$.
- Corner 2: $1977 + 26 = 2003$.
- Corner 3: $2003 + 26 = 2029$.
...
The number 2026 lies between 2003 and 2029, so it is on the 3rd side of Layer 26.
Specifically, $2026 = 2003 + 23$, so it is at offset $m=23$ from the start of Side 3 (where Corner 2 is offset 0). Since the side length is 26, 2026 is an interior point of the side (not a corner).

For a number $N$ situated strictly inside a side of layer $k$, the sum of its 6 neighbors is given by the formula $6N + 12$.
This formula is derived from the properties of the grid:
- Two neighbors are on the same layer: $N-1$ and $N+1$.
- Two neighbors are on the inner layer ($k-1$) with values corresponding to offsets $m-1$ and $m$ (relative to the start of the corresponding side).
- Two neighbors are on the outer layer ($k+1$) with values corresponding to offsets $m$ and $m+1$.
The sum simplifies to $6N + 12$ due to the quadratic nature of the corner values ($3k^2 + \dots$).

Using the formula for $N = 2026$:
Sum $= 6(2026) + 12$
$6 \times 2026 = 12156$
$12156 + 12 = 12168$

Alternatively, calculating the specific neighbors:
- Same layer: $2025, 2027$.
- Outer layer (Layer 27, Side 3 starts at 2161): Neighbors at offsets 23, 24 $\to 2184, 2185$.
- Inner layer (Layer 25, Side 3 starts at 1851): Neighbors at offsets 22, 23 $\to 1873, 1874$.

Sum:
$2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 + 1873 + 1874$
$= 4052 + 4369 + 3747$
$= 12168$.
