To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral grid, we first determine the position of 2026.

The hexagonal spiral is built in layers or rings. Ring 0 consists of just the number 1. Ring $n$ contains $6n$ numbers. The last number of Ring $n$ is given by the formula $M_n = 3n(n+1) + 1$.
We check for which $n$, $M_{n-1} < 2026 \le M_n$.
$M_{25} = 3(25)(26) + 1 = 1951$.
$M_{26} = 3(26)(27) + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is in **Ring 26**.

The numbers in Ring 26 range from 1952 to 2107.
We can identify the position of 2026 within the ring. The ring is a hexagon with 6 sides. Since 2026 is in Ring 26, the side length is 26.
The corners of Ring 26 are at indices (relative to start 1952):
Corner 1 (East): $1952 + 25 = 1977$.
Corner 2 (North-East): $1977 + 26 = 2003$.
Corner 3 (North-West): $2003 + 26 = 2029$.
Since $2003 < 2026 < 2029$, the number 2026 lies on **Side 3** (the top edge) of the hexagon, between the NE and NW corners.

Let's define a coordinate system where the center 1 is at $(0,0)$. Based on the provided snippet, the top edge (Side 3) of Ring $m$ has a constant $y$-coordinate of $m$, and $x$ ranges from $0$ (NE corner) to $-m$ (NW corner). The values increase as $x$ decreases (moving West).
For Ring $m=26$:
The NE corner (2003) is at $(0, 26)$.
The number 2026 is $2026 - 2003 = 23$ steps further along the side.
So, the position of 2026 is $(-23, 26)$.

The neighbors of a point $(x,y)$ in this hexagonal grid are $(x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x, y+1), (x-1, y+1)$.
For $(x,y) = (-23, 26)$, the neighbors are:
1.  **Left/Right (in Ring 26):**
    *   $(-24, 26)$: This is $2026 + 1 = \mathbf{2027}$.
    *   $(-22, 26)$: This is $2026 - 1 = \mathbf{2025}$.
2.  **Inner Neighbors (in Ring 25):**
    *   $(-23, 25)$ and $(-22, 25)$. These points lie on Side 3 of Ring 25.
    *   The value at $(x, 25)$ on Side 3 is given by $Val(x, 25) = 3(25)^2 - 25 + 1 - x$.
    *   For $x = -23$: $3(625) - 24 + 23 = 1875 - 1 = \mathbf{1874}$.
    *   For $x = -22$: $3(625) - 24 + 22 = 1875 - 2 = \mathbf{1873}$.
3.  **Outer Neighbors (in Ring 27):**
    *   $(-23, 27)$ and $(-24, 27)$. These points lie on Side 3 of Ring 27.
    *   The value at $(x, 27)$ is $Val(x, 27) = 3(27)^2 - 27 + 1 - x$.
    *   For $x = -23$: $3(729) - 26 + 23 = 2187 - 3 = \mathbf{2184}$.
    *   For $x = -24$: $3(729) - 26 + 24 = 2187 - 2 = \mathbf{2185}$.

The sum of the 6 neighbors is:
$2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185$
$= 4052 + 3747 + 4369$
$= 12168$.

Alternatively, for any non-corner number $C$ on the grid, the sum of its neighbors is $6C + 12$.
$6 \times 2026 + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.

**Answer:** 12168
