To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first determine the position of 2026 on the hexagonal spiral grid.

1.  **Identify the Layer:**
    The last number of layer $n$, denoted $L_n$, is given by $L_n = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
    For $n=25$, $L_{25} = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
    For $n=26$, $L_{26} = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
    Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is in Layer 26.

2.  **Identify the Side:**
    Layer 26 has 6 sides of length 26. The vertices (corners) of Layer 26 can be calculated from the start of the layer ($1952$) or the corners of the previous layer.
    Using the corner formula $V_k = L_{n-1} + (k+1)n$ (where $V_5 = L_n$):
    - $V_0 = 1951 + 26 = 1977$
    - $V_1 = 1977 + 26 = 2003$
    - $V_2 = 2003 + 26 = 2029$
    
    The number 2026 falls between $V_1$ ($2003$) and $V_2$ ($2029$). This corresponds to Side 3 of the hexagon. In the standard counter-clockwise spiral, Side 3 is the top edge, running West.

3.  **Determine Neighbors:**
    2026 is located on the segment corresponding to $y=26$ (in an oblique coordinate system $(u,v)$).
    It is not a corner ($2026 \neq 2003$ and $2026 \neq 2029$).
    The neighbors of a number $N$ on Side 3 of layer $n$ are:
    - Two neighbors in the same layer ($n=26$): $N-1$ and $N+1$.
      $2025$ and $2027$.
    - Two neighbors in the inner layer ($n=25$):
      Based on the grid alignment for the top edge, the neighbors are at the same relative horizontal index and shifted by +1.
      Using the derived formula for neighbors on this side: $N_{in} = N - (6n - 4)$ and $N_{in}' = N - (6n - 5)$.
      With $n=26$: $6(26)-4 = 152$.
      $1874 = 2026 - 152$.
      $1873 = 2026 - 153$.
    - Two neighbors in the outer layer ($n=27$):
      Formula: $N_{out} = N + (6n + 2)$ and $N_{out}' = N + (6n + 1)$.
      With $n=26$: $6(26)+2 = 158$.
      $2184 = 2026 + 158$.
      $2185 = 2026 + 159$.

4.  **Calculate the Sum:**
    Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185$
    Sum = $4052 + 3747 + 4369$
    Sum = $12168$.

    Alternatively, using the formula $S = 6N + 12$ derived for this side:
    $S = 6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.

Answer: 12168
