The number 2026 is located on a hexagonal grid where the natural numbers are arranged in a spiral. Let's determine the position of 2026.
The last number of ring $k$ is given by $H_k = 3k(k+1) + 1$.
$H_{25} = 3(25)(26) + 1 = 1951$.
$H_{26} = 3(26)(27) + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is in the 26th ring ($k=26$).

The number 2026 is not a corner of the hexagon. This can be verified by checking the indices of the corners in ring 26. The corners are at indices $H_{25} + n \cdot 26$ for $n=1, \dots, 6$.
Start of ring: 1952.
Corner 1: $1952 + 25 = 1977$.
Corner 2: $1977 + 26 = 2003$.
Corner 3: $2003 + 26 = 2029$.
2026 lies between Corner 2 and Corner 3, specifically in Segment 3 (West direction).
Offset from Corner 2: $m = 2026 - 2003 = 23$.

For a generic number $N$ (not a corner) in ring $k$, the sum of its 6 neighbors is given by the formula $S = 6N + 12$.
Let's verify the neighbors of 2026:
- Neighbors in the same ring (Ring 26): $2025, 2027$.
- Neighbors in the inner ring (Ring 25): corresponding to offsets $m-1$ and $m$ from Corner 2 of Ring 25 ($I_{25} = 1851$).
  $1851 + 22 = 1873$.
  $1851 + 23 = 1874$.
- Neighbors in the outer ring (Ring 27): corresponding to offsets $m$ and $m+1$ from Corner 2 of Ring 27 ($I_{27} = 2161$).
  $2161 + 23 = 2184$.
  $2161 + 24 = 2185$.

Sum of neighbors:
$2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168$.

Using the formula:
$6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.

Answer: 12168
