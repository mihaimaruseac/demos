To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, we first need to determine the position of 2026 within the grid structure.

**1. Determine the Ring Number**
The spiral is arranged in rings.
*   Ring 0 contains only the number 1.
*   Ring 1 contains numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers).
*   Ring $n$ contains $6n$ numbers.

The last number in Ring $n$, denoted $L_n$, is given by the formula:
$$L_n = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 3n(n+1)$$

We look for $n$ such that $L_{n-1} < 2026 \le L_n$.
Approximating $3n^2 \approx 2026 \implies n \approx 26$.
*   For $n=25$: $L_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
*   For $n=26$: $L_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.

Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number **2026 is in Ring 26**.

**2. Determine the Side and Position**
Ring 26 consists of 6 sides, each of length 26. The ring starts at $1952$.
The starting numbers (corners) of the 6 sides of Ring 26 can be found by adding multiples of 26 to the start of the ring (or generally, to the last number of the previous ring).
*   $L_{25} = 1951$.
*   End of Side 1: $1951 + 26 = 1977$.
*   End of Side 2: $1977 + 26 = 2003$.
*   End of Side 3: $2003 + 26 = 2029$.

The number 2026 is located between 2003 and 2029. Therefore, **2026 is on Side 3**.
Its position index $m$ along Side 3 (starting after the corner 2003) is:
$$m = 2026 - 2003 = 23$$
Since the side length is 26 and $1 < 23 < 26$, 2026 is an **interior point** of the side, meaning it has exactly 6 neighbors (2 in Ring 26, 2 in Ring 25, and 2 in Ring 27).

**3. Identify the Neighbors**
Based on the hexagonal grid structure, the neighbors of an interior point at index $m$ on Side 3 of Ring $n$ are:
*   **Same Ring ($n=26$):** The immediate neighbors $u-1$ and $u+1$.
    *   $2026 - 1 = 2025$
    *   $2026 + 1 = 2027$

*   **Inner Ring ($n-1=25$):** The neighbors correspond to indices $m-1$ and $m$ on Side 3 of Ring 25.
    *   Base for Side 3, Ring 25: $L_{24} + 2 \times 25$.
    *   $L_{24} = 1 + 3(24)(25) = 1801$.
    *   Base = $1801 + 50 = 1851$.
    *   Neighbor 1 ($m-1=22$): $1851 + 22 = 1873$.
    *   Neighbor 2 ($m=23$): $1851 + 23 = 1874$.

*   **Outer Ring ($n+1=27$):** The neighbors correspond to indices $m$ and $m+1$ on Side 3 of Ring 27.
    *   Base for Side 3, Ring 27: $L_{26} + 2 \times 27$.
    *   $L_{26} = 2107$.
    *   Base = $2107 + 54 = 2161$.
    *   Neighbor 1 ($m=23$): $2161 + 23 = 2184$.
    *   Neighbor 2 ($m+1=24$): $2161 + 24 = 2185$.

**4. Sum the Neighbors**
Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185$
Sum = $4052 + 3747 + 4369$
Sum = $12168$

(Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of neighbors of an interior point on a side: $S = 6u + 12$.
$6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.)

**Answer:** 12168
