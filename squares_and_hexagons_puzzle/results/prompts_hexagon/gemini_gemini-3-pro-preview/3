To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

The spiral is organized in hexagonal layers. The last number of layer $n$, denoted $L_n$, is given by the formula $L_n = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
For $n=25$, $L_{25} = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
For $n=26$, $L_{26} = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number 2026 is in Layer 26.

Layer 26 starts at $S_{26} = 1952$ and has $6 \times 26 = 156$ numbers. The layer consists of 6 segments of length 26. The number 2026 is located as follows:
$2026 - 1951 = 75$, so it is the 75th number in the layer.
Each segment has length 26.
Segment 1 (Direction $d_1$): Numbers 1952 to $1952+25 = 1977$.
Segment 2 (Direction $d_2$): Numbers 1977 to $1977+26 = 2003$. (Note: 1977 is Corner 1, 2003 is Corner 2).
Segment 3 (Direction $d_3$): Numbers 2003 to $2003+26 = 2029$.
2026 lies in Segment 3. It is $2026 - 2003 = 23$ steps away from Corner 2 (number 2003) along direction $d_3$ (Left).
The position of 2026 is not a corner ($2026 \neq 2003$ and $2026 \neq 2029$), so it has 2 neighbors in the same layer, 2 in the inner layer (Layer 25), and 2 in the outer layer (Layer 27).

The neighbors are:
1.  **Same Layer (Layer 26):**
    $2026 - 1 = 2025$
    $2026 + 1 = 2027$

2.  **Inner Layer (Layer 25):**
    The corresponding segment in Layer 25 starts at Corner 2 ($L_{24} + 2 \times 25 = 1801 + 50 = 1851$).
    The offset matches $m=23$.
    The neighbors are at offsets $m$ and $m-1$ from the corner.
    $1851 + 23 = 1874$
    $1851 + 22 = 1873$

3.  **Outer Layer (Layer 27):**
    The corresponding segment in Layer 27 starts at Corner 2 ($L_{26} + 2 \times 27 = 2107 + 54 = 2161$).
    The neighbors are at offsets $m$ and $m+1$ from the corner.
    $2161 + 23 = 2184$
    $2161 + 24 = 2185$

The sum of the 6 neighbors is:
$2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185$
$= 4052 + 3747 + 4369$
$= 12168$

Alternatively, for a number $N$ on a side of the hexagon (and not a corner), the sum of its 6 neighbors is $6N + 12$.
$6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.

Answer: 12168
