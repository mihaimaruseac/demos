Finding the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 in a hexagonal grid pattern such as the one you've described requires first determining the positions of these neighbors. The specific spiral you've described is arranged in increasingly large hexagons centered on 1. To address the problem efficiently, a direct computation or a mapping of the numbers into the hexagonal pattern can be used. Given the structure of this problem and the challenge of manual computation, using a programmatic approach should help solve it more accurately.

The code segment below, written in Python, performs the task by constructing the hexagonal grid up to a number larger than 2026 and then finds the neighbors of 2026, summing them:

```python
def hex_spiral():
    # Mapping to store the direction vectors anticlockwise
    directions = [
        (2, 0), (1, -1), (-1, -1), 
        (-2, 0), (-1, 1), (1, 1)
    ]
    # center origin
    x, y = 0, 0
    number = 1
    yield (x, y, number)
    size = 1

    while True:
        # Move to the start of the next ring
        x, y = x + 2, y + 1
        number += 1
        yield (x, y, number)

        for i in range(6):
            dx, dy = directions[i]
            for _ in range(size):
                x += dx
                y += dy
                number += 1
                yield (x, y, number)
        size += 1

# Create a generator
gen = hex_spiral()

# We store the positions and values in a dictionary
pos_dict = {}
target = 2026
found = False

while not found:
    x, y, n = next(gen)
    pos_dict[n] = (x, y)
    if n >= target + 6:  # We assume that the highest neighbors would be up to 6 numbers ahead
        found = True

# Find neighbors of 2026
target_pos = pos_dict[2026]
neighbors = []

for i in range(6):
    check_x = target_pos[0] + directions[i][0]
    check_y = target_pos[1] + directions[i][1]
    # Reverse lookup in dictionary
    neighbor = [key for key, value in pos_dict.items() if value == (check_x, check_y)]
    if neighbor:
        neighbors.extend(neighbor)

# Calculate sum of neighbors
sum_neighbors = sum(neighbors)
print(f"Sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026: {sum_neighbors}")
```

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This script iteratively generates the hexagonal pattern until it surpasses the numbers of interest then back-calculates which numbers fall beside the number 2026. The sum is then computed by accessing the calculated positions within our tracking dictionary.

This example demonstrates the computational approach; for an analytical approach or a specific numeric answer due to constraints like time or computing resources, further optimizations or adjustments might be necessary.
