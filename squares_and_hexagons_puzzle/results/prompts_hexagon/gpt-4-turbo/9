To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid, we need to determine how the numbers are placed in relation to each other as we move outward in the spiral. This task involves identifying the placement rules for the hexagonal spiral pattern.

From previous formulations and analysis of this spiral pattern, we can determine the ring in which a particular number is located based on its magnitude. The central number is 1, and we can observe that the numbers increase as we move outwards. The pattern of number placement fundamentally consists of layers (or rings) increasing outward from the center.

Here's a breakdown of the placement:
- The first ring around the 1 contains the numbers 2 through 7.
- The next ring contains the next set of numbers, incrementally increasing as the rings grow larger.

The formula to find the maximum number at each ring \( n \) is given by \( \text{max}_n = 1 + 3n(n-1) \). 

Let's approximate \( n \) for the number 2026:

\[ 2026 \approx 1 + 3n(n-1) \]
\[ 3n^2 - 3n - 2025 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula,
\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
with \( a = 3 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -2025 \),
\[ n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4 \times 3 \times 2025}}{6} \]
\[ n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6} \]
\[ n \approx \frac{3 \pm 155.91}{6} \]
\[ n_+ \approx 26.49, \]
\[ n_- \approx -25.49 \] (which doesn't make sense in this context).

So \( n \approx 26 \). Now, to determine neighbors is a bit more complex due to the arrangement, but, typically neighbors in such a hexagonal spiral pattern are:

1. Immediately above or below,
2. Immediately to the diagonally left or right (each has two diagonals).

Considering the huge range of numbers, I recommend applying a programmatic solution to generate the pattern and check the neighbors, as manually determining these positions can be error-prone. However, if the above adjustment and pattern hold, the neighbors of 2026 in each direction will typically be:
- Numbers +1, -1 (left and right on the ring).
- Numbers effectively - \(6n-1\) (last number of the inner ring directly connected) and + \(6n+1\) (first number of the outer ring directly connected).
- Additional neighbors relate to the above or below layers depending on orientation at around \(2026 \pm x\), where \(x\) is about the rate of change in each successive layer likely found empirically.

If you have access to scripting or programming tools, you should be able to generate the neighborhood around 2026 fairly directly and sum it accurately.
