To determine the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, it's crucial first to establish the structure and growth of the spiral and the location of a number relative to that pattern.

From an overview of the pattern concerning the center (1):
- 1 is surrounded by a ring of 6 numbers (2 to 7), each taking consecutive spots.
- The next layer is composed of 12 numbers (8 to 19).
- Subsequent layers continue to grow by adding segments around the previous, each layer adding 6 more numbers than the previous one.

To follow a systematic approach:
1. **Identify which layer contains 2026**: The number of elements in the nth layer or ring can be given by \(6n\), ignoring the center (1) by itself. The cumulative count of elements in successive rings grows large very quickly, so calculating for high numbers can be done by iterating through summed segments until reaching the range that includes 2026.

   Counting the numbers by cumulative sums:
   - 1st layer: 6 numbers (2 to 7).
   - 2nd layer: 12 numbers (total so far 1 + 6 + 12 = 19)
   - 3rd layer: 18 numbers (total so far 19 + 18 = 37),
   - ...

2. **Calculate the exact layer and position of 2026**: You'd iterate until you find the layer whose cumulative sum first exceeds 2026:
   - The nth layer will have 1 (center) + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n numbers.
   - This can be summarized as \(1 + 6 \times (1 + 2 + ... + n)\), which equals \(1 + 3n(n+1)\) due to the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

3. **Determining Neighbors' Values**: Once you've located 2026 precisely (in which hexagon ring, and its position in the sequence around that ring), to find the neighbors:
   - If 2026 lies on the 'corner' of the hexagon, its neighbors include elements from the previous and next ring.
   - If 2026 lies on a straight stretch, most of its neighbors will be in its ring, with one or two from adjacent rings.
   
The complexity of manually computing such a large index as 2026 in a hexagonal arrangement without computing aids can lead to errors; therefore, I would strongly recommend verifying this with a visualization or direct calculation using a programmed model if accuracy is needed.

Given the structure, the neighbors of a number \(n\) in this spiral grid are typically:
- \(n+1\), \(n+6\), \(n-6\) (directly connected ones in the same layer assuming they exist and it’s not a boundary case),
- \(n+6k+1\), \(n-6(k-1)-1\) (neighbors involving the transition to inner and outer layers).

Note: It's crucial to develop or use a specific interactive or algorithmic method for precise index locations, especially when dealing with large sequences in potentially irregular geometric arrangements like hexagonal spirals.
