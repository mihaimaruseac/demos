Label the centre of the grid as the axial-coordinate point (0 ,0).  
Take the six unit directions  

E = ( 1 , 0) , NE = ( 1 ,-1) , NW = ( 0 ,-1) , W = (-1 , 0) , SW = (-1 , 1) , SE = ( 0 , 1).

1.  Which “ring’’ is 2026 on?  
 The greatest number on ring k is  
  N k = 1 + 3k(k + 1).  

 Solve 1 + 3k(k + 1) ≥ 2026:

 3k(k + 1) ≥ 2025 → k(k + 1) ≥ 675 → k = 26.

 So 2026 is on ring 26 whose first number is

  N 25 + 1 = 1 + 3·25·26 + 1 = 1952.

 Hence the index of 2026 within its ring is  
  t = 2026 – 1952 = 74 (0 ≤ t ≤ 155).

2.  Where on the ring?  
   Start each ring k with the coordinate S k = (1 , k – 1) and walk round the
   hexagon in 6 sides of length k in the order  
   NE, NW, W, SW, SE, E.

   A point with index t = s·k + p (0 ≤ p ≤ k–1) lies on side

 s = ⌊t / k⌋ and is p steps along that side.

   For t = 74 and k = 26

 s = 2 (the W side) , p = 74 – 2·26 = 22.

   On the W side (r = –k) the coordinates are
  (q , r) = (k – 1 – p , –k).

   Thus 2026 is at
  (q , r) = (25 – 22 , –26) = (3 , –26).

3.  The six neighbour coordinates are obtained by adding the six unit
   directions:

 (4 ,-26) , (4 ,-27) , (3 ,-27) , (2 ,-26) , (2 ,-25) , (3 ,-25).

   Their rings are, respectively,
 26, 27, 27, 26, 25, 25.

4.  Convert the four off-ring neighbours to numbers.

   Ring 25: first number 1802,   k = 25, side 2 (W).

 p = 24 – q.

 (3 ,-25):  p = 24 – 3 = 21 ⇒ t = 2·25 + 21 = 71  
   number = 1802 + 71 = 1873.

 (2 ,-25):  p = 24 – 2 = 22 ⇒ t = 72  
   number = 1802 + 72 = 1874.

   Ring 27: first number 2108,   k = 27, side 2 (W).

 p = 26 – q.

 (4 ,-27):  p = 26 – 4 = 22 ⇒ t = 2·27 + 22 = 76  
   number = 2108 + 76 = 2184.

 (3 ,-27):  p = 23 ⇒ t = 77  
   number = 2108 + 77 = 2185.

5.  Two neighbours lie on the same ring:

 (4 ,-26)  → t = 73  → 2025  
 (2 ,-26)  → t = 75  → 2027.

6.  Add the six neighbours:

 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185  
 = 4052 + 3747 + 4369  
 = 12168.
