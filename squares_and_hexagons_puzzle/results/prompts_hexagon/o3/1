Step 1 Locate the ring that contains 2026  
The last number of ring k (radius k) is  

 T(k)=1+3k(k+1)

T(25)=1+3·25·26=1951 < 2026  
T(26)=1+3·26·27=2107 ≥ 2026

So 2026 is in ring 26 (radius 26).  
The first number in that ring is 1952, hence the offset of 2026 in the ring is

 2026–1952 = 74 (counting the first cell of the ring as offset 0).

Step 2 Find the exact position on the ring  
Starting with the first cell (1952) at the “east-point” of the hexagon, the 156 cells of ring 26 are travelled counter-clockwise along the six sides, 26 cells per side:

side 1 (north-west) … offsets 1–26  
side 2 (west) …………… offsets 27–52  
side 3 (south-west) …… offsets 53–78  
side 4 (south-east) …… offsets 79–104  
side 5 (east) …………… offsets 105–130  
side 6 (north-east) …… offsets 131–155

Offset 74 lies on side 3:  
74 – 53 = 21 ⇒ it is the 22nd cell along the south-west side.

Therefore the two neighbours on the same ring are the previous and next numbers on that side:

 2025  and 2027.

Step 3 The two neighbours in the inner ring  
Along every side the inner ring (radius 25) runs exactly parallel to the ring we are on, with its numbers increased by the constant difference 1952–1802 = 150 (because ring 25 starts with 1802 and ring 26 with 1952).

Hence the two inner neighbours are

 1802 + (53+21) = 1873, 1802 + (53+22) = 1874.

Step 4 The two neighbours in the outer ring  
The outer ring (radius 27) also runs parallel, its first number is 2108; the difference to ring 26 is 2108–1952 = 156.  
So the two outer neighbours are

 1952+74 +156 = 2184, and 2185.

Step 5 Sum of all six neighbours  

 1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185  
 = (1873+2185) + (1874+2184) + (2025+2027)  
 = 4058 + 4058 + 4052  
 = 12 168.
