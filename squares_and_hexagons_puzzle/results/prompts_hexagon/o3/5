First find where 2026 is situated in the hex-spiral.

1.  Numbers on the kth “ring’’  
   biggest number on ring k :  
        M(k)=1+3k(k+1)        (k=0 is the centre 1)

   Solve  M(k-1)<2026≤M(k)

        M(25)=1+3·25·26=1951
        M(26)=1+3·26·27=2107

   So 2026 is on ring k = 26.  
   Every ring k contains 6k numbers, hence ring 26 has 156 cells
   numbered

        1952 (=M(25)+1), 1953, … , 2107 (=M(26)) .

2.  Index of 2026 inside its ring  
        t = 2026 – 1952 = 74          (counting from 0)

   Each ring is traversed in six straight segments of length

        NW, W, SW, SE, E  : 26 steps each
        NE                : 25 steps (the last step would return to the
                                        first cell and is omitted)

   The cumulative lengths are
        26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 155.

   Since 52 ≤ 74 < 78, 2026 is on the third segment (the SW-segment)
   and is the j = 74 – 52 = 22-nd cell along that segment.
   Such a cell (ring k, SW-segment) is an ordinary “edge’’ cell, not a
   corner.

3.  Fixed neighbour–differences on a SW-segment  
   For any number n lying on the SW-segment of ring k (k ≥ 2)

      NE-neighbour         = n – 1
      SW-neighbour         = n + 1
      E-neighbour          = n – (6k – 3)
      SE-neighbour         = n – (6k – 4)
      NW-neighbour         = n + (6k + 2)
      W-neighbour          = n + (6k + 3)

   (These constants are easily checked on the first few rings; they
   hold for every non-corner of that segment.)

   With k = 26 (so 6k = 156) and n = 2026 we get

      NE : 2026 – 1         = 2025
      SW : 2026 + 1         = 2027
      E  : 2026 – 153       = 1873
      SE : 2026 – 152       = 1874
      NW : 2026 + 158       = 2184
      W  : 2026 + 159       = 2185

4.  Sum of the six neighbours

      2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185
      = 4052 + 3747 + 4369
      = 12168.

Answer: 12168
