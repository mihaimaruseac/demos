Number 2026 lies on ring 26 of the spiral, because  

max number of ring k : 1 + 3 k (k+1)  
1 + 3·25·26 = 1951   < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3·26·27 = 2107.

For every ring k we put the first number of the ring at the eastern
corner (coordinate (k,0)) and then walk round the ring in the directions  

NW , W , SW , SE , E , NE.

With this convention  

start of ring k S(k) = 1 + 3(k–1)k + 1 = 2 + 3(k–1)k.

For k = 26 S(26) = 2 + 3·25·26 = 1952.

Hence 2026 is the 2026 – 1952 = 74-th step of ring 26.
Each complete side of the ring has 26 cells; numbering the sides
0-5 as we go round, step 74 is on side 2 (= the SW side) and 22 cells
along that side.  
Using axial coordinates (q,r) the position of 2026 is therefore

( q , r ) = (26,0)            (start)  
        → 26 steps NW → (26,-26)  
        → 26 steps  W → ( 0,-26)  
        → 22 steps SW → (-22,-4)

So 2026 is at (-22,-4).

Adding the six direction vectors
E = (1,0), NE = (1,-1), NW = (0,-1), W = (-1,0),
SW = (-1,1), SE = (0,1)

gives the neighbours’ coordinates and the rings they lie on:

(-21,-4) ring 25  
(-21,-5) ring 26  
(-22,-5) ring 27  
(-23,-4) ring 27  
(-23,-3) ring 26  
(-22,-3) ring 25

Converting each back to a number (ring k, side s, offset t :

number = S(k) + s·k + t )

yields

(-21,-4)  → 1873  
(-21,-5)  → 2025  
(-22,-5)  → 2184  
(-23,-4)  → 2185  
(-23,-3)  → 2027  
(-22,-3)  → 1874

Finally,

1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12 168.

Sum of all six neighbours of 2026: 12 168
