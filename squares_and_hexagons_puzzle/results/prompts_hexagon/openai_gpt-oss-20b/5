The spiral is a hexagonal lattice grown from the centre where 1 sits.  
Using axial coordinates \((q,r)\) with neighbours

\[
E=(1,0),\;NE=(0,-1),\;NW=(-1,-1),\;W=(-1,0),\;SW=(0,1),\;SE=(1,-1)
\]

the numbers on the spiral can be enumerated in six directions around each
ring \(k\):

* start at \((k,0)\) – this is the first number of the ring.
* move \(k\) steps in each of the first five directions.
* move \(k-1\) steps in the last direction.

With this rule one can compute the value at any lattice point.

### 1. Locate \(2026\)

Determine the ring of \(2026\).

\[
n_{\text{max}}(k)=1+3k(k+1)
\]

The smallest \(k\) with \(n_{\text{max}}(k)\ge 2026\) is \(k=26\).  
Its first number is

\[
n_{\text{start}}(26)=3\cdot 26\cdot25+2=1952
\]

The offset of \(2026\) inside this ring is

\[
d = 2026-1952 =74
\]

Following the six directions we find that

\[
\text{offset }\;74 = 26+26+22
\]

hence the axial coordinates of \(2026\) are

\[
(\;q,r\;)=(-22,-4)
\]

### 2. Find the six neighbours

The six neighbours of \((-22,-4)\) are:

| direction | coordinates | ring \(k\) | offset \(d\) | number |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| \(+E\)    | \((-21,-4)\)| 25 | 71          | 1873 |
| \(+NE\)   | \((-21,-5)\)| 26 | 73          | 2025 |
| \(+NW\)   | \((-22,-5)\)| 27 | 76          | 2184 |
| \(-E\)    | \((-23,-4)\)| 27 | 77          | 2185 |
| \(-NW\)   | \((-23,-3)\)| 26 | 75          | 2027 |
| \(-NE\)   | \((-22,-3)\)| 25 | 72          | 1874 |

(The offsets are obtained exactly as we did for the centre:
follow the six directions, using the same rule
\(k\) steps for the first 5 directions and \(k-1\) for the last.)

### 3. Sum of neighbour values

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sum}&=1873+2025+2184+2185+2027+1874\\
          &=12\,168
\end{aligned}
\]

---

\[
\boxed{12\,168}
\]
