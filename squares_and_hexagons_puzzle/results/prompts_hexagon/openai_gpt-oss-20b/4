In a hexagonal spiral the natural numbers are arranged in successive rings around the centre.  
For a given number \(N\) we need the six neighbouring cells on the grid.

---

### 1.  Find the ring of \(N\)

Numbers up to ring \(r\) are

\[
1+3r(r+1)
\]

The smallest \(r\) with  

\[
1+3r(r+1) \ge 2026
\]

is \(r=26\) (because \(3\cdot25\cdot26=1950<2025\) and \(3\cdot26\cdot27=2106\ge2025\)).  
Thus 2026 lies in the 26‑th ring.

The first number of ring \(r\) is  

\[
S(r)=2+3r(r-1)
\]

Hence  

\[
S(26)=1952.
\]

The offset of 2026 inside its ring is  

\[
k=2026-S(26)=74.
\]

---

### 2.  Coordinate of 2026

Using axial coordinates \((q,r)\) on a hex grid, the start of a ring is at \((r,0)\).  
For ring 26 the start is \((26,0)\).

The ring is traversed in this order of side‑direction vectors  

\[
\begin{array}{c}
(-1,1),\;(-1,0),\;(0,-1),\;(1,-1),\;(1,0),\;(0,1)
\end{array}
\]

Each side has \(r\) steps.  
With \(k=74\) we are on side 2 (the third side) and have taken \(22\) steps of that side:

\[
\text{Position}= (26,0)+(-1,1)\! \times26+(-1,0)\! \times26+(0,-1)\! \times22
=(-26,4).
\]

So the hex‑grid coordinate of 2026 is **(-26, 4)**.

---

### 3.  Neighbours

Adding the six direction vectors gives the coordinates of the six neighbours:

\[
\begin{array}{c}
(-27,5), (-27,4), (-26,3),\\
(-25,3), (-25,4), (-26,5)
\end{array}
\]

Determine for each coordinate which ring it belongs to (by the distance from the origin) and its offset inside that ring:

| Coord | Ring | Δ (steps from ring start) | Number |
|-------|------|--------------------------|--------|
| (-27,5) | 27 | 54+22 = 76 | 2108+76 = **2184** |
| (-27,4) | 27 | 54+23 = 77 | 2108+77 = **2185** |
| (-26,3) | 26 | 52+23 = 75 | 1952+75 = **2027** |
| (-25,3) | 25 | 50+22 = 72 | 1802+72 = **1874** |
| (-25,4) | 25 | 50+21 = 71 | 1802+71 = **1873** |
| (-26,5) | 26 | 52+21 = 73 | 1952+73 = **2025** |

---

### 4.  Sum of neighbors

\[
\begin{aligned}
S &= 2184+2185+2027+1874+1873+2025  \\
  &= 2184+2185=4369 \\
  &\quad +2027=6396 \\
  &\quad +1874=8270 \\
  &\quad +1873=10143 \\
  &\quad +2025=12168 .
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]
