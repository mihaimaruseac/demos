The six numbers that touch any given integer \(n\) in the hexagonal Ulam‑spiral are the six integers that lie one step away from it in the six axial directions.  
If the integer \(n\) lies in the \(k\)-th ring (the rings are numbered so that the centre \(1\) is ring 0), the six neighbours of \(n\) are  

\[
n\pm 1,\qquad n\pm (6k-1),\qquad n\pm 6k .
\]

Indeed, when we walk round a ring of radius \(k\) the numbers increase by one as we go round the ring; the neighbours that lie on the next outer ring are exactly \(n\pm 6k\), and the neighbours that lie on the next inner ring are \(n\pm (6k-1)\).

Consequently the sum of the six neighbours of any integer that is not the centre is  

\[
\bigl(n+1\bigr)+\bigl(n-1\bigr)+\bigl(n+(6k-1)\bigr)+\bigl(n-(6k-1)\bigr)+\bigl(n+6k\bigr)+\bigl(n-6k\bigr)
=6n .
\]

Thus **the sum of the six neighbours of any non‑central number is simply \(6n\).**

Because \(2026\neq 1\), its six neighbours sum to  

\[
6\times 2026 = 12\,156 .
\]

\[
\boxed{12\,156}
\]
