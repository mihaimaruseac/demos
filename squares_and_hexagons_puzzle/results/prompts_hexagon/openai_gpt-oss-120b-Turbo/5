The six neighbours of any integer \(n\) on the hexagonal spiral are the six numbers that are obtained by moving one step in each of the six axial directions.  
For a number that lies on the third side of the \(r\)-th ring (the “south‑west” side) the six neighbours are

\[
\begin{aligned}
n-1,\; n+1,\;
n-r,\; n+r,\;
n+(r+1),\; n-(r+1).
\end{aligned}
\]

For \(2026\) we first determine the ring.  
The maximal number of the \(r\)-th ring is  

\[
H_r = 1+3r(r+1).
\]

Solving \(H_{25}=1951<2026\le H_{26}=2107\) gives \(r=26\).

Within the 26‑th ring the first number is  

\[
s = H_{25}+1 = 1952 .
\]

The position of \(2026\) in the ring is  

\[
k = 2026-s = 74 .
\]

Since each side contains \(r=26\) numbers, the side index is  

\[
\left\lfloor\frac{k}{r}\right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{74}{26}\right\rfloor = 2 ,
\]

so \(2026\) lies on the third side (the side whose direction vector is \((-1,0)\).  
Consequently its six neighbours are

\[
\begin{aligned}
&2026-1 = 2025,\\
&2026+1 = 2027,\\
&2026-r = 2000,\\
&2026+r = 2052,\\
&2026+(r+1)=2053,\\
&2026-(r+1)=1999 .
\end{aligned}
\]

Adding them gives  

\[
2025+2027+2000+2052+2053+1999 = 12156 .
\]

\[
\boxed{12156}
\]
