Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a hexagonal grid where natural numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern. Our goal is to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in this spiral.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's try to understand how the numbers are arranged in the hexagonal spiral. A hexagonal grid means each cell has six neighbors, unlike a square grid where each cell has four neighbors. The given snippet shows a small part of the spiral:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

From this, we can observe the following:

1. The number 1 is at the center.
2. The numbers spiral outward in a counterclockwise direction (assuming the given snippet is oriented correctly).
3. Each layer around the center adds a ring of numbers.

### Identifying the Pattern

To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine its position in the spiral. Let's try to find a pattern or formula that can help us locate any number in the spiral.

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers can be thought of as being arranged in concentric hexagonal layers or "rings" around the center. The center is layer 0 (just the number 1), layer 1 is the first ring around it, layer 2 is the next ring, and so on.

Each layer `n` (where `n >= 1`) contains `6n` numbers. This is because each side of the hexagon in layer `n` has `n` numbers, and there are 6 sides.

The total number of numbers up to and including layer `n` is:
- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2 to 7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8 to 19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20 to 37)
- ...
- Layer `n`: `6n` numbers

So, the total numbers up to layer `n` is `1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)`.

We can find the layer `n` in which a number `k` resides by solving for `n` in:
`1 + 3n(n+1) >= k`

For `k = 2026`:
`1 + 3n(n+1) >= 2026`
`3n(n+1) >= 2025`
`n(n+1) >= 675`

Let's find `n` such that `n(n+1)` is just above 675.

`n^2 + n - 675 = 0`

Solving the quadratic equation:
`n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2`

`sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97`

So,
`n ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485`

Since `n` must be an integer, we take `n = 26`.

Let's check:
`n = 25`: `25*26 = 650` (which is less than 675)
`n = 26`: `26*27 = 702` (which is greater than 675)

So, 2026 is in layer 26.

### Determining the Position within the Layer

Now, let's find out how many numbers are there before layer 26:
`1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`

So, numbers from 1 to 1951 are in layers 0 to 25.

Numbers in layer 26 start at 1952 and go up to 1951 + 6*26 = 1951 + 156 = 2107.

But we're interested in 2026, which is in layer 26.

The position within layer 26 is `2026 - 1951 = 75`.

Since each layer has 6 sides with `n` numbers each, the numbers are arranged in order around the hexagon. For layer 26, each side has 26 numbers.

The position 75 within the layer can be broken down as follows:

Each full side has 26 numbers. So:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52
- Side 3: positions 53-78

75 falls on side 3 (since 53 ≤ 75 ≤ 78), and it's the `75 - 52 = 23`rd number on side 3.

### Visualizing the Hexagonal Grid

In a hexagonal grid, each side is a line of numbers. The neighbors are the numbers adjacent to the current number in the grid. For a number in the middle of a side, it has two neighbors on the same side (left and right), and one neighbor on each of the two adjacent sides.

However, since the spiral is continuous, the exact neighbors depend on the direction of the spiral. Given that the spiral is counterclockwise, the neighbors can be determined based on the position within the side.

But to simplify, let's think about the general pattern:

For a number at position `p` in layer `n`:
- The number before it in the spiral is `p - 1` (if `p > 1`).
- The number after it in the spiral is `p + 1` (if `p < 6n`).
- The other four neighbors are the numbers adjacent in the grid, which would be from the previous and next layers.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe a better approach is to find the numbers immediately before and after 2026 in the spiral, and then determine their neighbors.

### Finding Neighbors of 2026

Given that 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26, and each side has 26 numbers:

- The number before 2026 in the spiral is 2025 (position 74 in layer 26).
- The number after 2026 in the spiral is 2027 (position 76 in layer 26).

Now, the other four neighbors are the numbers adjacent to 2026 in the grid, not necessarily in the spiral order. These would be:

1. The number directly "above" 2026 in the grid (towards the center).
2. The number directly "below" 2026 in the grid (away from the center).
3. The number to the "left" in the grid.
4. The number to the "right" in the grid.

But determining these requires knowing the exact grid positions, which is complex without a visual. Instead, let's think about the general pattern for neighbors in a hexagonal spiral.

In a hexagonal spiral, each number (except the center) has six neighbors. For a number at position `p` in layer `n`:

- The inner neighbor is the number in the same position in the previous layer (`n-1`).
- The outer neighbor is the number in the same position in the next layer (`n+1`).
- The two neighbors along the same side are `p-1` and `p+1` in the same layer.
- The other two neighbors are the numbers at positions `p-1` and `p+1` in the adjacent sides.

This is quite involved. Maybe a better approach is to find the numbers that are adjacent to 2026 based on its position.

Given that 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26, and each side has 26 numbers:

- Side 1: 1952-1977
- Side 2: 1978-2003
- Side 3: 2004-2029
- Side 4: 2030-2055
- Side 5: 2056-2081
- Side 6: 2082-2107

2026 is in side 3 (positions 2004-2029), specifically position 23 (since 2004 + 22 = 2026, because 2004 is position 1).

Now, the neighbors are:

1. Previous in spiral: 2025
2. Next in spiral: 2027
3. Inner neighbor: same position in layer 25. Layer 25 has 6*25=150 numbers, starting at 1952 - 6*26 = 1952 - 156 = 1796 (Wait, no. Layer 25 starts at 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951 + 1 = 1952? Wait, no, layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n.

Wait, let's re-examine the numbering.

Total numbers up to layer n-1: 1 + 3*(n-1)*n
So layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n + 1 = 2 + 3n(n-1)

Wait, no, layer 0: 1
layer 1: 6 numbers: 2 to 7
layer 2: 12 numbers: 8 to 19
layer 3: 18 numbers: 20 to 37
...

So layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n + 1 = 2 + 3n(n-1)

Wait, no, layer 1 starts at 2, layer 2 at 8, layer 3 at 20, etc.

So layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n

So layer 26 starts at 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

Wait, but layer 1 starts at 2, which is 1 + 3*0*1 = 1, but layer 1 starts at 2. Hmm.

Wait, layer 0: 1 number: 1
layer 1: 6 numbers: 2 to 7
layer 2: 12 numbers: 8 to 19
...

So layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n

So layer 26 starts at 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

But layer 1 starts at 2, which is 1 + 3*0*1 = 1, but layer 1 starts at 2. Maybe layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n + 1 for n >=1.

Wait, no, layer 1 starts at 2, which is 1 + 3*0*1 +1 = 2
layer 2 starts at 8, which is 1 + 3*1*2 +1 = 8
layer 3 starts at 20, which is 1 + 3*2*3 +1 = 20
...

So layer n starts at 1 + 3*(n-1)*n +1 = 2 + 3n(n-1)

So layer 26 starts at 2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 1950 = 1952

So layer 25 starts at 2 + 3*25*24 = 2 + 1800 = 1802

So the inner neighbor of 2026 is the number in layer 25 at the same position within the layer.

Position within layer 26 is 75, so same position in layer 25 is 75.

Layer 25 has 6*25=150 numbers, starting at 1802, so position 75 is 1802 + 74 = 1876.

Similarly, the outer neighbor is in layer 27 at the same position.

Layer 27 starts at 2 + 3*27*26 = 2 + 2106 = 2108
Position 75 is 2108 + 74 = 2182.

Now, the other four neighbors are the numbers adjacent in the grid. For a hexagonal grid, these would be the numbers at positions 74 and 76 in the same layer (which are 2025 and 2027), and the numbers at positions 75 in the adjacent sides.

In a hexagonal grid, each side is connected to two adjacent sides. The position 75 is on side 3 (since 2004-2029 is side 3, positions 53-78). The adjacent sides are side 2 (positions 27-52) and side 4 (positions 79-104).

The neighbors would be the numbers at position 75 in these adjacent sides, but since side 2 only goes up to 52 and side 4 starts at 79, this seems off.

Wait, perhaps the neighbors are the numbers at positions 75 in the previous and next sides, but since sides are of length 26, position 75 is on side 3 (positions 53-78), so the adjacent sides are side 2 (positions 27-52) and side 4 (positions 79-104).

But position 75 is position 23 on side 3 (since 2004 is position 1, 2005 is 2, ..., 2026 is 23).

The neighbors would then be:

- Previous in spiral: 2025 (position 22 on side 3)
- Next in spiral: 2027 (position 24 on side 3)
- Inner neighbor: 1876 (position 23 on side 3 in layer 25)
- Outer neighbor: 2182 (position 23 on side 3 in layer 27)
- Left neighbor: position 23 on side 2. Side 2 has positions 27-52, so position 23 is 27 + 22 = 49
- Right neighbor: position 23 on side 4. Side 4 starts at 2030, so position 23 is 2030 + 22 = 2052

Wait, let's verify the side numbering:

Layer 26 starts at 1952.

Side lengths are 26.

Side 1: 1952-1977
Side 2: 1978-2003
Side 3: 2004-2029
Side 4: 2030-2055
Side 5: 2056-2081
Side 6: 2082-2107

2026 is in side 3 (2004-2029), position 23 (2004 is 1, ..., 2026 is 23).

Adjacent sides are side 2 (positions 1978-2003) and side 4 (2030-2055).

The left neighbor is the number at position 23 in side 2, which is 1978 + 22 = 2000.

The right neighbor is the number at position 23 in side 4, which is 2030 + 22 = 2052.

So the six neighbors are:

1. 2025 (previous in spiral)
2. 2027 (next in spiral)
3. 1876 (inner neighbor)
4. 2182 (outer neighbor)
5. 2000 (left neighbor)
6. 2052 (right neighbor)

Now, let's sum these:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1876 + 2182 = 4058
2000 + 2052 = 4052

Total sum = 4052 + 4058 + 4052 = 12162

But let's verify the calculation:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1876 + 2182 = 4058
2000 + 2052 = 4052

4052 + 4058 = 8110
8110 + 4052 = 12162

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let me double-check the neighbors:

- Previous in spiral: 2025 (correct, as 2026 is next)
- Next in spiral: 2027 (correct)
- Inner neighbor: position 23 in layer 25. Layer 25 starts at 1802, position 23 is 1802 + 22 = 1824? Wait, no, position 1 is 1802, position 23 is 1802 + 22 = 1824. Earlier I had 1876, which seems incorrect.

Wait, layer 25 starts at 1802, position 75 is 1802 + 74 = 1876, but position within side is 23, so position in layer is 23, so 1802 + 22 = 1824.

Similarly, outer neighbor: layer 27 starts at 2108, position 23 is 2108 + 22 = 2130.

Left neighbor: position 23 in side 2. Side 2 starts at 1978, position 23 is 1978 + 22 = 2000.

Right neighbor: position 23 in side 4. Side 4 starts at 2030, position 23 is 2030 + 22 = 2052.

So the correct neighbors are:

1. 2025
2. 2027
3. 1824
4. 2130
5. 2000
6. 2052

Now, sum:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1824 + 2130 = 3954
2000 + 2052 = 4052

Total: 4052 + 3954 = 8006
8006 + 4052 = 12058

### Final Answer

After carefully recalculating, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is **12058**.
