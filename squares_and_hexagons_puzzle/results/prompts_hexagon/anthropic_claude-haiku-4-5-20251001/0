I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum its 6 neighbors.

## Understanding the Spiral Pattern

On a hexagonal grid, the spiral starts at 1 and moves outward. Let me first identify the pattern by analyzing the structure.

The spiral is organized in hexagonal "rings":
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring k: contains 6k numbers

## Finding Which Ring Contains 2026

Ring k ends at: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

For ring k: 3k² + 3k + 1

Let me find k where 3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026:
- 3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
- 3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
- k² + k - 675 = 0
- k = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 = (-1 + 51.97...)/2 ≈ 25.48

So ring 26 contains 2026.

Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

## Structure of a Ring

Each ring k has 6k numbers arranged in 6 sides, each with k numbers.
Ring 26 has 156 numbers in 6 sides of 26 numbers each.

Position within ring 26: position 75
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So 2026 is on side 3, at position 75 - 52 = 23 (the 23rd number on side 3).

## Finding Neighbors on Hexagonal Grid

On a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number at position p on a ring:

1. **Two neighbors on the same ring**: positions (p-1) and (p+1) on ring k
2. **Two neighbors on inner ring**: position p and p+1 on ring (k-1)  
3. **Two neighbors on outer ring**: position p-1 and p on ring (k+1)

For 2026 at position 75 in ring 26:

**Same ring (ring 26):**
- Position 74: this is 1951 + 74 = 2025
- Position 76: this is 1951 + 76 = 2027

**Inner ring (ring 25):**
Ring 25 ends at 1951, contains 150 numbers.
- Position 75: this is 1951 - 150 + 75 = 1876
- Position 76: this is 1951 - 150 + 76 = 1877

**Outer ring (ring 27):**
Ring 26 ends at 2107, ring 27 starts at 2108.
Ring 27 has 162 numbers.
- Position 74: this is 2107 + 74 = 2181
- Position 75: this is 2107 + 75 = 2182

## Calculating the Sum

The six neighbors are:
- 2025 (same ring, position 74)
- 2027 (same ring, position 76)
- 1876 (inner ring, position 75)
- 1877 (inner ring, position 76)
- 2181 (outer ring, position 74)
- 2182 (outer ring, position 75)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1876 + 1877 + 2181 + 2182

= (2025 + 2027) + (1876 + 1877) + (2181 + 2182)
= 4052 + 3753 + 4363
= **12168**
