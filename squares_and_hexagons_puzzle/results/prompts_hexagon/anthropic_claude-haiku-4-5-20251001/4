I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and sum its 6 neighbors.

## Understanding the Spiral Pattern

First, let me understand how the spiral grows on a hexagonal grid. Starting with 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3 form a ring of 6 numbers around it
- Then comes a ring of 12 numbers
- Then a ring of 18 numbers
- Ring n has 6n numbers (for n ≥ 1)

## Finding Which Ring Contains 2026

The total numbers through ring n is:
$$1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$$

For ring 25: $3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$

For ring 26: $3(26)^2 + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$

Since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107, the number 2026 is in ring 26.

## Position Within Ring 26

Ring 26 contains numbers from 1952 to 2107.

2026 is at position: $2026 - 1951 = 75$ within ring 26 (counting from 1).

Ring 26 has $6 \times 26 = 156$ numbers total.

## Structure of a Ring

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring is divided into 6 sections of equal length. Ring n has 6n numbers, so each section has n numbers.

For ring 26: each of the 6 sections has 26 numbers.

Position 75 in the ring: $75 = 2 \times 26 + 23$

So 2026 is in the 3rd section (after positions 1-26 and 27-52), at position 23 within that section.

## Finding Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, the 6 neighbors of a number consist of:
- Numbers adjacent within the same ring
- Numbers in adjacent rings

For a number in ring n at position p within a section:

**Same ring neighbors:**
- Position 74 (one position counterclockwise): 2025
- Position 76 (one position clockwise): 2027

**Inner ring (ring 25) neighbors:**
Ring 25 has $6 \times 25 = 150$ numbers total, with 25 numbers per section.

Ring 25 ends at: $3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 1951$

The number at section 3, position 23 in ring 26 corresponds to a position in ring 25. The inner neighbor is typically at section 3, position 23 in ring 25.

Ring 25 section 3 starts at: $1951 - 150 + 2(25) + 1 = 1951 - 150 + 51 = 1852$

Inner ring neighbor: $1852 + 22 = 1874$ (position 23 in that section is index 22)

**Outer ring (ring 27) neighbors:**
Ring 27 starts at: $2107 + 1 = 2108$

Ring 27 has $6 \times 27 = 162$ numbers, with 27 per section.

Position 75 maps to ring 27. Section 3, position 24 and 25 in ring 27.

Ring 27 section 3 starts at: $2108 + 2(27) = 2108 + 54 = 2162$

The two outer neighbors are at positions 23 and 24 in section 3:
- $2162 + 22 = 2184$
- $2162 + 23 = 2185$

## The Six Neighbors

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring: 1874 (connecting to position 23, section 3 of ring 25)
- Outer ring: 2184, 2185 (adjacent positions in section 3 of ring 27)
- Inner ring second: Need the other inner connection at section 2-3 boundary

Let me recalculate more carefully: position 23 in section 3 of ring 26 connects to positions 22-23 in section 3 of ring 25, and positions 23-24 in section 3 of ring 27.

Ring 25, section 3, position 22-23: $1852 + 21 = 1873$ and $1852 + 22 = 1874$
Ring 27, section 3, position 23-24: $2162 + 22 = 2184$ and $2162 + 23 = 2185$

**The six neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 1873, 1874, 2184, 2185**

**Sum** = $2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168$

The answer is **12168**.
