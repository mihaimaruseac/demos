I need to find the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. On a hexagonal grid, starting from 1, the spiral moves outward in layers. Let me trace the pattern:
- Center: 1
- Layer 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
- Layer k: 6k numbers

The spiral has layers where layer k contains 6k numbers.

**Finding which layer contains 2026:**

Layer k ends at position: $1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k) = 1 + 6(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)$

I need: $1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026$
- $3k(k+1) \geq 2025$
- $k(k+1) \geq 675$

Testing: 
- $k=25$: $25 \times 26 = 650$ (too small)
- $k=26$: $26 \times 27 = 702$ (this works)

Layer 25 ends at: $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$
Layer 26 ends at: $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$

So 2026 is in layer 26, and it's the $(2026 - 1951) = 75$th number in layer 26.

**Finding position within layer 26:**

Layer 26 has $6 \times 26 = 156$ numbers. These 156 numbers are arranged in 6 sides of the hexagon, with 26 numbers per side.

Position 75 in layer 26: $75 = 26 + 26 + 23 = 2 \times 26 + 23$

So 2026 is 23 numbers into the 3rd side of layer 26.

**Key property of hexagonal spirals:**

On a hexagonal grid, each number (except those on edges of the spiral) has exactly 6 neighbors. For a number at position in layer k:
- Numbers in the same layer (adjacent on the same spiral arm)
- Numbers in adjacent layers

For a number at distance d along a side of layer k, its 6 neighbors are:
1. The number before it in the spiral: 2025
2. The number after it in the spiral: 2027
3-4. Two neighbors in the same layer (adjacent along the hexagon edge)
5-6. Two neighbors in adjacent layers (inner layer k-1 and outer layer k+1)

**Finding the actual neighbors:**

For position 75 in layer 26 (which is 23 into the 3rd side):

The neighbors in the spiral sequence are: **2025** and **2027**

For the 4 other neighbors, I need to use the structure. In a hexagonal spiral:
- At position p in layer k, the two neighbors along the hexagon edge are at positions p-1 and p+1 in layer k (when not at side boundaries)
- Position 75 is in the middle of a side, so:
  - Previous in layer: **2025** (position 74)
  - Next in layer: **2027** (position 76)

For the neighbors in layer k-1 and k+1:
- The corresponding position in layer k-1 relates by roughly position p - (p-1) mapping
- For layer 25: positions near $75 - 26 = 49$ 
- For layer 27: positions near $75 + 26 = 101$

More precisely, on a hexagonal grid at position p in layer k:
- Inner neighbor (layer k-1): approximately position $p - 26 = 49$ in layer 25 → number $1951 + 49 = 2000$
- Outer neighbors (layer k+1): approximately positions around $p + 26$ in layer 27 → numbers around $2107 + (75+26) = 2208$

By the symmetry of hexagonal spirals, if 2026 is at position 75 in layer 26:
- Layer 25 position 49: $1951 + 49 = 2000$
- Layer 25 position 50: $1951 + 50 = 2001$  
- Layer 27 position 101: $2107 + 101 = 2208$
- Layer 27 position 102: $2107 + 102 = 2209$

The 6 neighbors sum to:
$$2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2001 + 2208 + 2209 = 12470$$

The answer is **12470**.
