The number 2026 lies on the 64th layer of the spiral. One can arrive at this by using the formula which calculates the maximum number on the 'n' th layer of the spiral. 

Max on 'n' th layer = 3n(n-1) + 1.

We solve the equation 3n(n-1) + 1 = 2026, and find the value of 'n' to be 64. 
Also, the lowest number in this layer can be found by using the formula for the max number on 'n-1' th layer which is 3(n-1)(n-2) + 1, substituting n as 64 gives 1927. 

Now, 2026 lies exactly halfway into the 64th layer (2026 is the 50th number in the 64th layer and each layer contains 100 numbers). So, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are the 49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, 99th and 100th numbers in this layer.

These can be calculated as 1927 + 49 = 1976, 1927 + 50 = 1977, 1927 + 51 = 1978, 1927 + 52 = 1979, 1927 + 99 = 2026, 1927 + 100 = 2027. 

The sum of these numbers is 1976 + 1977 + 1978 + 1979 + 2026 + 2027 = 11963.
