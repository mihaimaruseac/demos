To solve this problem, first, we need to find the position of 2026 on the hexagonal grid. 

The natural numbers on the hexagonal grid appear in concentric layers of hexagons, starting with 1 in the middle. Each layer contains six more numbers than the last. Specifically, the first layer contains 1 number, the second layer contains 1 + 6 = 7 numbers, the third contains 7 + 12 = 19 numbers, the fourth contains 19 + 18 = 37 numbers, and so on.

From this pattern, we can see that the nth layer contains 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1 numbers.

So, to find the layer of 2026, we need to solve the quadratic equation 3n^2 - 3n + 1 = 2026. This will yield n as approximately 32.2. Since n must be a natural number, we take 33 as the layer of 2026. 

Now we need to determine the position of 2026 in its layer. To do that, calculate the maximum number in the 32nd layer, which is 3*32^2 - 3*32 + 1 = 3073. The numbers in the 33rd layer range from 3074 to 3697. So, 2026 is the (2026-3074) = -1048th number in the 33rd layer.

Now, consider the six numbers surrounding a number in the nth layer: they are the corresponding numbers in the (n-1)th, nth and (n+1)th layers. Since each layer is a rotation and scaling of the previous layer, these six neighboring numbers also follow a recurring pattern: each number is ahead of its corresponding number from the previous layer by six or behind by six from the next layer.

To find the neighbors of -1048 in the 33rd layer, find the corresponding numbers in the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th layers: these are (2026-6*33) = 1828, 2026, and (2026+6*34) = 2224. The other three neighbors are one step ahead of 1828 and one step behind 2224 in their respective layers: these are 1828+1 = 1829, 2224-1 = 2223, and one step behind or ahead of 2026 in the 33rd layer: these are 2026+1 = 2027 and 2026-1 = 2025.

So the sum of all six neighbors is 1828 + 2026 + 2224 + 1829 + 2223 + 2027 + 2025 = 13,182.
