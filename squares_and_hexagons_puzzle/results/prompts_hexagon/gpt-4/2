The number 2026 is located at the corner of hexagon, in the sequence of the numbers 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2029.

It follows the pattern where each corner number equals 3n^2 - 3n + 1 where n is a positive integer. We can find n for 2026 by solving the equation 2026 = 3n^2 - 3n + 1.

By using this equation we can find that the n for 2026 is 38.

In this sequence, the incremental gap between the corner numbers is equal to 6(n-1), where n is the number of the layer of the hexagon (starting from 1 at the center). So in the 38th layer, the difference between corner numbers is 6*37 = 222.

If we solve 2026 - 222 we get the corner number directly counterclockwise to 2026, which is 1804. Thus, the six neighboring numbers to 2026 in the hexagonal spiral are: 2025, 2027, 2028, 1803, 1804, and 2248.

Finally, summing these six numbers gives 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 1803 + 1804 + 2248 = 11935.
