We notice that the hexagon numbers (1, 7, 19, 37, ...) all have the sequence: $6n+1$. After you subtract 1, all of the remaining numbers are multiples of 6. If you divide all of the terms by 6, you get $n^2 + n = \frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$. This is the formula for triangular numbers, which depends on $n$ and $n-1$. The $(n-1)$th term is the one at $60^\circ$. Thus, the $n$th term is the one at $0^\circ$.

Given number $2026$, use this formula to find what shape of a hexagon it falls into. First we subtract -1. 

$2025 \div 6 = 337$. $337 = 23^2 + 22$

Using the previous rules, $337$ is equal to term $23$.

Using the rule of decreasing by $n-1$ to get $338$, and $24^2$ on the outside layer of the hexagon, we have $22$ times the previous number. Therefore $338=23^2+22$.

We want to find the 6 neighbors, and 338 is directly above 2026, therefore using the previous knowledge of decrease by $n-1$, we perform the following operations:
\begin{align*} 336+(22 \cdot 2) &= 336 + 44\\ &= 380 \\ 380+45 &= 425 \\ 426+46 &= 472 \\ 472+47 &= 519 \\ 520+48 &= 568 \\ 568+49 &= 617 \\ \end{align*}

Adding all together, we have $2026+380+425+472+519+568+617 = \boxed{4007}$.

Notice that in the calculation of the neighbors, we decreased once, and increased for five times. The decreased one neighbor is in the inside layer of hexagon, while the five increased neighbors are all in the outside layer of hexagon. Use this pattern can help you to solve this type of problems more quickly.
