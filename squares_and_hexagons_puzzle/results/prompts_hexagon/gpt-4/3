If you look at the pattern in the hexagonal grid, you'll see that the six surrounding numbers for a given point in the spiral are 12 steps back, 6 steps back, 6 steps ahead, 12 steps ahead, 18 steps back and 18 steps ahead.

So the six neighbors for 2026 are 2026 - 18 = 2008, 2026 - 12 = 2014, 2026 - 6 = 2020, 2026 + 6 = 2032, 2026 + 12 = 2038 and 2026 + 18 = 2044.

Adding them all together gives 2008 + 2014 + 2020 + 2032 + 2038 + 2044 = 12,156.
