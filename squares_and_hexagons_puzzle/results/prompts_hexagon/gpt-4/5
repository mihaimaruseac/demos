The spiral is formed by hexagons. The number 1 is at the center of the first hexagon. The numbers 2 through 7 are at the vertices of the second hexagon, the numbers 8 through 19 are at the vertices of the third hexagon, and so on.

Let n be the side length of a hexagon. The first hexagon (n = 1) contains 1 number. The following hexagons each contain 6(n - 1) numbers. Hence we find the value of n for the number 2026 by solving the equation 

1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6(n - 1) = 2026 

This is an arithmetic series so the sum is 

(1/2) * n * [1 + 6(n - 1)] = 2026 

By simplifying this we find n = 36. 

Therefore, the numbers at the vertices of the 36th hexagon are 1807, 1808, ..., 2026, ..., 2533. It is clear that 2026 is halfway around the hexagon from 1807, hence its neighbors are 2025, 2026 + 36 = 2062, 2063, 2027, 2061, and 2024. 

The sum of these numbers is 2025 + 2062 + 2063 + 2027 + 2061 + 2024 = 12262.
