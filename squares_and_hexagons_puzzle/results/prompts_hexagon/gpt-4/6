The number spiral on a hexagonal grid creates sequences along each axis where each sequence increments by 6 from the previous one. To get to the number 2026, we can divide 2026 by 6, which is approximately 337.67. Rounding down gives 337, indicating that 337 full sequences of 6 have been completed before the number 2026.

If we multiply 337 by 6, we get 2022, which represents the end number for the 337th sequence. This means that 2026 is four numbers away in the sequence after 337. Therefore, the number 2026 is the fourth number in the 338th sequence.

Within each sequence, the neighbours can be determined by (n-1)*6, (n-1)*6+1, (n-1)*6+2, n*6+3, n*6+4 and n*6+1, where n is the sequence number.

For number 2026, the neighbours are therefore:
N1 = (338 - 1)*6 = 2022
N2 = (338 - 1)*6 + 1 = 2023
N3 = (338 - 1)*6 + 2 = 2024
N4 = 338*6 + 3 = 2029
N5 = 338*6 + 4 = 2030
N6 = 338*6 + 1 = 2027.

Therefore, the sum is N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 + N5 + N6 = 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2029 + 2030 + 2027 = 12185.
