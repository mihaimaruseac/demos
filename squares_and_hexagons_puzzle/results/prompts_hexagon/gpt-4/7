For each hexagonal ring in the spiral, it starts with a number that is a perfect square (specifically, n^2 for the nth ring), and ends with a number that is 1 less than a perfect square.

Therefore, we need to find the ring that contains the number 2026. We see that the following conditions are satisfied:

45^2 = 2025 < 2026 < 2026 < 46^2 = 2116

So 2026 is on the 46th ring with 2025, 2026, ..., 2116.

Now, follow the pattern of the first ring: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), the second ring with (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ..., 15), and so on, we can see that the 2026th number is the second number on the 46th ring.

So, its upper left number is the first number on the 46th ring, which is 45^2 = 2025; 

Its upper right number is the last number on the 45th ring, which is 44^2 = 1936;

Its right number is the third number of the 46th ring, which is 2027; 

Its lower right number is the fourth number of the 46th ring, which is 2028;

Its lower left number is the fifth number of the 46th ring, which is 2029;

Its left number is the sixth number of the 46th ring, which is 2030.

So the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 2025 + 1936 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 12075.
