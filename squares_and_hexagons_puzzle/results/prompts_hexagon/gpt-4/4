To solve this problem, you need to figure out certain patterns in the spiral. One important one is that hexagons corresponding to perfect squares have one of their corners at the current number. The closest such perfect square is $44^2 = 1936$. 

Thus, 2026 is positioned $2026 - 1936 = 90$ steps after 1936 on the spiral. We know, each layer has 6 corners and has $44 \times 6 = 264$ cells. So we end up at the fourth corner which is $3 \times 44 = 132$ steps away from 1936. 

From each corner of the hexagon, proceeding clockwise, you increase by $44 - 1$, $44$, and so on. Thus, your neighbors are $1936 + 132 - 43 - 2$, $1936 + 132 - 43 - 1$, $1936 + 132$, $1936 + 132 + 44 + 1$, $1936 + 132 + 44 + 2$, and $1936 + 132 + 44 + 3$. 

Adding these numbers gives a result $6 \times 2026 + (-43 - 2 - 1) + (44 + 1 + 2 + 3) = 12156 + 0 = \boxed{12156}.$
