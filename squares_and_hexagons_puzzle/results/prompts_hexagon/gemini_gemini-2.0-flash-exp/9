Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number $n$. We want to find $S(2026)$.

The numbers are laid out in a spiral starting from 1 in the center.
Let the number at the center be $a_0 = 1$.
The first layer consists of 6 numbers: $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.
The second layer consists of 12 numbers: $8, 9, \dots, 19$.
The $n$-th layer has $6n$ numbers. The last number in the $n$-th layer is
$$a_n = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1.$$
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \approx 2026$.
We have $3n^2 + 3n \approx 2025$, so $n^2 + n \approx 675$.
$n \approx \sqrt{675} \approx \sqrt{676} = 26$.
Let $n = 25$. Then $3(25^2) + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
Let $n = 26$. Then $3(26^2) + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 < 2107$, the number 2026 is in the 26th layer.
The 26th layer has $6 \times 26 = 156$ numbers. The first number in the 26th layer is $1952$. The last number is $2107$.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of the number $n$ is $6n$.
If $n$ is not on the innermost ring or on the outermost ring, then the sum of its neighbors is $6n$.
However, 2026 is on the 26th ring, which is the outermost ring that exists.
Therefore, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026) = 12156$.

In general, the sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $S(n) = 6n$.
We need to find the coordinates of 2026. Let the center be $(0,0)$.
$2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The 26th ring has 156 elements. The first element is 1952.
The numbers on the 26th ring are $1952, 1953, \dots, 2107$.
Then $2026 - 1951 = 75$. So 2026 is the 75th number on the 26th ring.

We have $S(n) = 6n$. Therefore $S(2026) = 6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
