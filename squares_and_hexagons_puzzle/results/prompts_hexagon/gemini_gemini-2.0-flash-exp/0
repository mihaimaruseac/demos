Let the hexagonal grid be arranged such that the number 1 is at the origin (0, 0). We need to find the coordinates of 2026 in the grid and then find the numbers at the 6 neighboring coordinates.

The numbers in the spiral increase as we move away from the center. The numbers are arranged in layers around the center. The first layer consists of the number 1. The second layer consists of the numbers 2 to 7. The third layer consists of the numbers 8 to 19. In general, the $n$-th layer consists of $6n$ numbers, except for the first layer, which has only one number. The largest number in the $n$-th layer is $1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k = 1 + 6\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)$.

To find the layer containing 2026, we need to find $n$ such that $1 + 3n(n+1) \ge 2026$.
$3n(n+1) \ge 2025$
$n(n+1) \ge 675$
Since $25^2 = 625$, we can try $n=25$:
$25(26) = 650$
Try $n=26$:
$26(27) = 702$
So 2026 is in the 26th layer.
The largest number in the 25th layer is $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 3(650) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
The numbers in the 26th layer start from 1952. The last number is $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3(702) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
So 2026 is in the 26th layer.
$2026 - 1951 = 75$. So 2026 is the 75th number in the 26th layer.
Each side of the hexagon has 26 numbers. $75 = 26 \times 2 + 23$.
So we are on the third side, and 23 numbers from the start of the side.
The coordinates are (25, 0). Rotate by 120 degrees:
Let $n = 26$.
(n, 0)
Side 1: (n, 0) to (n/2, n\sqrt{3}/2)
Side 2: (n/2, n\sqrt{3}/2) to (-n/2, n\sqrt{3}/2)
Side 3: (-n/2, n\sqrt{3}/2) to (-n, 0)
Side 4: (-n, 0) to (-n/2, -n\sqrt{3}/2)
Side 5: (-n/2, -n\sqrt{3}/2) to (n/2, -n\sqrt{3}/2)
Side 6: (n/2, -n\sqrt{3}/2) to (n, 0)

In our case, 2026 is the 75th number in the 26th layer. The first side has numbers 1952 to 1977. The second side has numbers 1978 to 2003. The third side has numbers 2004 to 2029.
The first number on side 3 is 2004. We have 2026 - 2004 + 1 = 23. So 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3.
Let the number 1 be at (0, 0). The neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The sum is 27.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032. We need to find which 6 numbers are neighbors of 2026.

Since 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3, the numbers around it are 2020, 2021, ..., 2031.
Consider a hexagonal grid. A number in the middle is surrounded by 6 numbers.
The sum of the neighbors of a number is typically around 6 times the number itself.
$6(2026) = 12156$.
$2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2027 + 2028 = 12141$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
