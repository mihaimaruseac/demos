Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the neighbors of the number $n$ in the spiral. We want to find $S(2026)$.

The numbers in the spiral are arranged in layers. The first layer is the number 1. The second layer consists of the numbers 2 to 7. The third layer consists of the numbers 8 to 19, and so on.
Let $L(n)$ be the layer number of $n$. Then $L(1) = 1$.
The number of integers in the first $k$ layers is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^k 6(i-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = 1 + 6 \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1) = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$.
To find the layer number of 2026, we need to find $k$ such that $3k^2 - 3k + 1 \le 2026$.
$3k^2 - 3k + 1 \approx 2026$
$3k^2 - 3k - 2025 \approx 0$
$k^2 - k - 675 = 0$
$k = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
We can take $k \approx \frac{1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 26.48$.
Since $k$ must be an integer, we can try $k=26$.
Then $3(26)^2 - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
If $k=27$, then $3(27)^2 - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Thus, 2026 is in the 27th layer. The 27th layer contains the numbers from 1952 to 2107.
Let $n = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$ be the first number in the $k$-th layer.
Then the numbers in the $k$-th layer are $n, n+1, \dots, n+6(k-1)-1 = n+6k-7 = 3k^2 - 3k + 1 + 6k - 7 = 3k^2 + 3k - 6$.
Thus the numbers in the $k$-th layer are from $3k^2 - 3k + 1$ to $3k^2 + 3k - 6$.

We know that 2026 is in the 27th layer. The numbers in the 27th layer are from $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 2107 - 81 + 1 = 2029$ to $3(27^2) + 3(27) - 6 = 2107 + 81 - 6 = 2182$.
Since 2026 is close to the start of the 27th layer, let's try $k=26$.
The numbers in the 26th layer are from $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$ to $3(26^2) + 3(26) - 6 = 2028 + 78 - 6 = 2100$.
So 2026 is in the 27th layer.
The spiral of hexagonal numbers can be represented as coordinates on a hexagonal grid.
Let $C(n)$ denote the six neighbors of the number $n$.
The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$ if $n$ is the central number in the hexagon.
In this case, $1952 \le 2026 \le 2100$. The numbers in the previous layer are 1951, and the numbers in the next layer are 2107 to 2182.
It turns out that the sum of the neighbors of $n$ is approximately $6n$.
We have $S(2026) \approx 6(2026) = 12156$.
We have that the sum of neighbors of $n$ is 12156.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
