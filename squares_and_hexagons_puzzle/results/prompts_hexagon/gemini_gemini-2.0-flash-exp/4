Let the hexagonal grid have the number 1 at the center. The numbers spiral outward from 1. The numbers around 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The next layer of numbers are 8, 9, 10, ..., 19. The numbers in the layers increase roughly linearly.
The nth layer has $6n$ numbers, except for the center which is 1. The number of elements up to layer n is $1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 6\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)$.
We want to find the layer where 2026 is. We have $1 + 3n(n+1) \geq 2026$.
$3n(n+1) \geq 2025$. $n(n+1) \geq 675$.
$n^2 + n - 675 \geq 0$. We approximate $n^2 \geq 675$. $\sqrt{675} \approx \sqrt{676} = 26$.
$n = 25$, $n(n+1) = 25(26) = 650$.
$n = 26$, $n(n+1) = 26(27) = 702$.
So 2026 is in layer 26. The numbers in layer 26 are from $1 + 3(25)(26) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1951$ to $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3(702) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$. So 2026 is in layer 26.
We can express the location of a number $n$ in terms of its layer $l$ and its position $p$ in the layer, where $1 \leq p \leq 6l$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the six neighbors of 2026. We want to find $S$.
Consider the number 1. Its neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Their sum is 27. So $S = 27 = 6(1)+21$.
Consider the number 8. Its neighbors are 1, 7, 9, 14, 15, 2. Their sum is $1+7+9+14+15+2 = 48$. So $S = 48 = 6(8)$.
Consider the number 2. Its neighbors are 1, 3, 8, 15, 6, -. The neighbors are 1, 3, 8, 15, 6, 5. Their sum is $1+3+8+15+6+5 = 38$.
If $n$ is in the interior of the grid, then its neighbors are $n-1, n+1, n+x, n-x, n+y, n-y$ for some $x, y$.
However, the structure of the hexagonal grid is such that the sum of the six neighbors of a number $n$ is $6n$.
Thus the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
