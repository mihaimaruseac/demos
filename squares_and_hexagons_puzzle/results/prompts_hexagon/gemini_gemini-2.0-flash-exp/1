Let the hexagonal grid be denoted by coordinates $(x, y)$.
The number 1 is at $(0, 0)$.
The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are at $(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1)$.
The numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are at $(0, -1), (1, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2)$.
The numbers 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 are at $(-1, 1), (-2, 1), (-2, 0), (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (0, -2)$.
The numbers 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 are at $(1, -2), (2, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)$.
The numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 are at $(-1, 2), (-2, 2), (-3, 1), (-3, 0), (-3, -1), (-2, -2)$.
The number $n$ is in the $k$-th ring if $3(k-1)k < n \le 3k(k+1)$.
We have $3(k-1)k < 2026 \le 3k(k+1)$, so $3k^2 - 3k < 2026 \le 3k^2 + 3k$.
We can approximate $3k^2 \approx 2026$, so $k^2 \approx \frac{2026}{3} \approx 675.33$. Thus $k \approx \sqrt{675.33} \approx 25.98$, so $k = 26$.
Then $3k(k+1) = 3(26)(27) = 2106$ and $3(k-1)k = 3(25)(26) = 1950$.
So $1950 < 2026 \le 2106$, meaning 2026 is in the 26th ring.
Consider the neighbors of the number $n$ in this hexagonal grid. If the numbers are in increasing order, the neighbors are $n-1, n+1, n-x, n+x, n-y, n+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are approximately $\sqrt{n}$.
The sum of the neighbors of a number $n$ in a hexagonal grid is typically $6n$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the neighbors of 2026. Since the numbers form a spiral, we can approximate the sum of the neighbors as $6n = 6(2026) = 12156$.
Let $n = 1 + 3k(k-1) + m$, where $0 \le m < 6k$. Then $n = 2026$ is in the 26th ring. $2026 = 1 + 3k(k-1) + m$ with $k = 26$. $2025 = 3(26)(25) + m = 1950 + m$, so $m = 2025 - 1950 = 75$.
If $n$ is in the $k$-th ring, the sum of the six neighbors is $6n$. However, this is just an approximation.

The sum of the numbers around the number 1 is $2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27 = 9 \cdot 3$.
The sum of the numbers around the number 2 is $1+3+7+8+9+4 = 32$.
The sum of the numbers around the number 3 is $2+4+8+10+1+5 = 30$.
The sum of the numbers around the number 4 is $3+5+10+11+1+6 = 36$.
The sum of the numbers around the number 5 is $4+6+11+12+1+2 = 36$.
The sum of the numbers around the number 6 is $5+7+12+13+1+3 = 41$.

We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let $f(n)$ be the sum of the neighbors of $n$. We can write $f(n) = a \cdot n + b$.
If we have an arithmetic spiral, the sum of the six neighbors is $6n$.

Let $S$ be the sum of the numbers around 2026. Then $S = 6 \cdot 2026 = 12156$.
Consider the neighbors of 1. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
The average of these numbers is $\frac{2+3+4+5+6+7}{6} = \frac{27}{6} = 4.5$.
However, $1 \cdot 6 = 6$, so $S = 6n$ is not correct.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
