Let the hexagonal grid be represented by coordinates $(x, y)$ such that the center is $(0, 0)$. We have the spiral starting with 1 at $(0, 0)$. The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The neighbors of 2 are 1, 3, 7, 16, 15.
We can think of the hexagonal spiral as having layers. The first layer is just the number 1. The second layer has numbers 2 through 7. The third layer has numbers 8 through 19. In general, the $n$-th layer has $6n$ numbers. The number of numbers in the first $n$ layers is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^n 6i = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
Let's find the layer number of 2026. We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \geq 2026$. So $3n^2 + 3n - 2025 \geq 0$. Dividing by 3, we have $n^2 + n - 675 \geq 0$. The roots of $n^2 + n - 675 = 0$ are $n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-675)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}$.
Since $n$ must be positive, $n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 25.48$. So 2026 is in the 26th layer.
The largest number in the 25th layer is $3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
So 2026 is $2026 - 1951 = 75$ numbers into the 26th layer.
In the $n$-th layer, the numbers are $3n^2 + 3n + 2, 3n^2 + 3n + 3, \dots, 3n^2 + 3n + 6n + 1 = 3n^2 + 9n + 1$.
The numbers in the 26th layer are $3(26^2) + 3(26) + 2, \dots, 3(26)^2 + 9(26) + 1 = 2028 + 1 = 2704$.
So the numbers in the 26th layer are $2028, \dots, 2703$.
The numbers go around the hexagon.
If we let $x$ be the number, the sum of the neighbors of $x$ is $6x$.
In our case, $x = 2026$. The sum of its 6 neighbors is $6x = 6(2026) = 12156$.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of the number $n$ is $6n$. In our case, $n=2026$. So the sum of the neighbors is $6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
