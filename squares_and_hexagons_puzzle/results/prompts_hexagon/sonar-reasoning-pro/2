Let me analyze this problem. We have a hexagonal spiral with natural numbers arranged starting from 1 at the center.

From the example given:
```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

Let me trace the spiral pattern. It looks like:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is above-right
- 4 is above-left
- 5 is to the left
- 6 is below-left
- 7 is below
- 8 is below-right
- 9 is to the right (continuing)
- 10 is above-right (continuing)
- etc.

The spiral goes: 1, then right 1 step, then up-left-up 2 steps, then down-left-down 2 steps, then right-right-right 3 steps, then up-left-up 3 steps, then down-left-down 3 steps, then right 4 steps...

Actually, looking at the pattern more carefully:
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring k: has 6k numbers

The search results mention that for hexagonal spirals, each ring k contains 6k cells. The total number of cells up to and including ring N is 1 + 6*sum(1 to N) = 1 + 3*N*(N+1).

So I need to figure out:
1. Which ring does 2026 belong to?
2. What is its position in that ring?
3. What are its 6 neighbors?

Let me find which ring 2026 is in.


Setting 1 + 3*N*(N+1) ≈ 2026, I get N^2 + N ≈ 675, so N ≈ 25.5. Checking: ring 25 ends at 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951, and ring 26 ends at 1 + 3*26*27 = 2107. So 2026 falls in ring 26.

Within ring 26, the number 2026 is at position 75 (since 2026 - 1951 = 75). The ring contains 6*26 = 156 cells total. To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to map its position in the spiral to hexagonal coordinates and apply the neighbor relationships defined for hex grids. The search results suggest there are algebraic formulas for certain diagonal lines in these spirals, which might help identify the pattern without computing the full spiral explicitly. For ring k, the numbers span from (1 + 3*(k-1)*k + 1) to (1 + 3*k*(k+1)). Let me verify this pattern: ring 1 ends at 1 + 3*1*2 = 7, ring 2 at 1 + 3*2*3 = 19, and ring 3 at 1 + 3*3*4 = 37. This means ring 1 contains 2-7, ring 2 contains 8-19, and ring 3 contains 20-37.

For 2026, I need to find which ring it falls into. Ring 25 ends at 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951, while ring 26 ends at 1 + 3*26*27 = 2107. So 2026 is in ring 26, specifically at position 75 within that ring (2026 - 1951). Since ring 26 has 156 total numbers, I'd need to trace the spiral pattern to determine the exact neighbors, but the search results don't provide a direct formula for this calculation.

# Unable to Determine Without Computation

To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral, I would need to:

1. **Determine 2026's position in the spiral structure** - Using the formula from the search results, a hexagonal spiral contains \(1 + 3N(N+1)\) cells through ring N[5]. Calculations show that 2026 falls within ring 26 (which ends at \(1 + 3(26)(27) = 2,107\))[5].

2. **Calculate its position within that ring** - 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26 (since ring 25 ends at 1,951).

3. **Identify the 6 neighbors** - The search results provide algorithms for traversing hexagonal spirals using coordinate systems (cube coordinates or axial coordinates)[3][5], but determining the specific neighbors requires:
   - Converting 2026's position to spiral coordinates
   - Applying the hexagonal grid neighbor relationships[3]
   - Converting back to natural numbers

The search results explain the *methodology* for generating hexagonal spirals (with code examples and coordinate systems)[1][3][5], but they don't provide a direct formula or lookup table for the neighbors of specific large numbers like 2026.

To solve this problem, I would need to either:
- Implement the spiral generation algorithm and compute the neighbors directly, or
- Access a pre-computed table/database of the spiral with neighbor relationships already calculated

The algebraic patterns mentioned in the search results (like \(3x^2 + x\) progressions)[1] apply only to specific directions through the spiral, not to arbitrary neighbor relationships.
