Alright, let's break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Understanding the spiral layout**

The problem says:  
Natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a **hexagonal grid**.

From the snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

We can see that the center seems to be `1`, and numbers spiral outward in a hexagonal pattern.

Let's reconstruct the spiral arrangement.

---

### **Hexagonal spiral indexing**

A common way to index hexagonal grids is to use **axial coordinates** \((q, r)\) or **cubic coordinates** \((x, y, z)\) with \(x + y + z = 0\).

In many hexagonal spirals starting at 1:

- The first ring (numbers 2 to 7) has 6 cells around the center.
- The \(k\)-th ring (\(k \ge 1\)) contains \(6k\) numbers.

Let’s verify:

- Center: 1 (ring 0)
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 → 6 numbers
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 → 12 numbers
- Ring 3: numbers 20 to 37 → 18 numbers
- Ring \(k\): numbers \(2 + 6\frac{k(k-1)}{2}?\) Wait, better formula:

Actually, total numbers up to ring \(k\):

\[
1 + 6 \times (1 + 2 + \dots + k) = 1 + 6 \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

Check:  
k=0: 1  
k=1: 1 + 3×1×2 = 7 → numbers 1 to 7  
k=2: 1 + 3×2×3 = 19 → numbers 1 to 19  
k=3: 1 + 3×3×4 = 37 → numbers 1 to 37  
Yes.

So ring \(k\) has \(6k\) numbers, first number of ring \(k\) is:

\[
N_{\text{first}}(k) = 2 + 6 \times \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 2 + 3k(k-1)
\]

Check: k=1: 2 + 0 = 2, k=2: 2 + 3×2×1 = 8, k=3: 2 + 3×3×2 = 20. Good.

---

## **2. Which ring is 2026 in?**

We solve \(N_{\text{first}}(k) \le 2026\):

\[
2 + 3k(k-1) \le 2026
\]
\[
3k(k-1) \le 2024
\]
\[
k(k-1) \le \frac{2024}{3} \approx 674.666...
\]
\[
k^2 - k - 674.666 \le 0
\]

Approx: \(k \approx \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 674.666}}{2} \approx \frac{1 + \sqrt{2699.666}}{2} \approx \frac{1 + 51.96}{2} \approx 26.48\)

So ring \(k=26\) contains numbers starting at \(N_{\text{first}}(26) = 2 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 2 + 1950 = 1952\).

Ring 26 has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) numbers: from 1952 to 1952 + 156 - 1 = 2107.

So 2026 is in ring \(k=26\).

---

## **3. Position of 2026 within ring 26**

Ring \(k\) has 6 sides of length \(k\).  
Numbering within ring: from 0 to \(6k-1\).

First number in ring: 1952.  
Index within ring: \(m = 2026 - 1952 = 74\).

Side length \(k=26\), so each side has 26 numbers.

Sides:  
Side 0: m = 0..25  
Side 1: m = 26..51  
Side 2: m = 52..77  
Side 3: m = 78..103  
Side 4: m = 104..129  
Side 5: m = 130..155  

m=74 → side index = 2 (since 52 ≤ 74 ≤ 77), position along that side = 74 - 52 = 22nd number on side 2 (counting from 0).

---

## **4. Neighbors in hexagonal grid**

In a hexagonal spiral, each number has 6 neighbors:  
- Two in the same ring (previous/next along the ring)  
- Possibly one or two in adjacent rings.

But for a number **not at a corner** (vertex of hexagon) in the ring:  
It will have:  
- 2 neighbors in same ring (m-1, m+1)  
- 1 neighbor in previous ring (inner)  
- 3 neighbors in next ring (outer) — but if it's exactly at a corner? Let's check.

Actually, in hexagonal tiling, each hex cell has 6 neighbors:  
For a cell on a hexagonal spiral ring \(k\):

If it's on a **edge** (not a corner) of the ring’s hexagon:  
- 2 neighbors in ring k (adjacent in ring)  
- 1 neighbor in ring k-1 (towards center)  
- 3 neighbors in ring k+1 (on next ring) — because a hex edge touches 3 outer hexes.

But if it's at a **corner** (vertex) of the ring’s hexagon:  
- 2 neighbors in ring k  
- 2 neighbors in ring k-1  
- 2 neighbors in ring k+1  
Because a vertex touches 2 inner and 2 outer cells.

Our m=74: side index 2, position along side = 22 (out of 26). Corners are at m multiples of k=26: m=0,26,52,78,104,130, etc. m=74 is not a corner (since 74 mod 26 = 22 ≠ 0). So it's an **edge** position.

So neighbors:  
1. Previous ring (k=25): 1 neighbor  
2. Same ring (k=26): 2 neighbors (m-1, m+1)  
3. Next ring (k=27): 3 neighbors

---

## **5. Finding those neighbor numbers**

We need the actual natural numbers.

Let’s find them systematically.

---

**Same ring neighbors:**

m=74 → numbers:  
Previous in ring: m=73 → 1952+73 = 2025  
Next in ring: m=75 → 1952+75 = 2027

---

**Inner ring neighbor (k=25):**

Ring 25 first number: \(2 + 3\times 25\times 24 = 2 + 1800 = 1802\).  
Ring 25 has \(6\times 25 = 150\) numbers: 1802 to 1951.

We need mapping: On hexagonal spiral, moving inward from an edge cell in ring k to ring k-1:  
The rule: If you’re at side s, position t along side (0 ≤ t < k), the inner neighbor is at ring k-1, side s, position t, **except** at the start of side (t=0) which has 2 inner neighbors.

Our s=2, t=22 (not zero), so inner neighbor is at ring 25, side 2, position 22.

Index m_inner in ring 25: side 2 → m = 2*k + t = 2×25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72 in ring 25.

Number = 1802 + 72 = 1874.

---

**Outer ring neighbors (k=27):**

Ring 27 first number: \(2 + 3\times 27\times 26 = 2 + 2106 = 2108\).  
Ring 27 has 162 numbers: 2108 to 2269.

From an edge cell in ring k to ring k+1:  
It connects to 3 outer cells:  
- One at same side index s, position t (direct outward)  
- Plus two adjacent on next side depending on geometry.

Better to deduce from small example.

---

Let’s check small k to see neighbor pattern.

From given data:  
Take number 6 (ring 1? Wait, center ring k=1: numbers 2–7, so 6 is in ring 1). Actually center 1’s neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7 — all in ring 1.

Take number 8 (first of ring 2). In diagram snippet:  
Spiral:  
Ring 1: 2..7 around 1.  
Ring 2: starting 8 next to 7, then 9 next to 2, etc.

We can test 7: neighbors? 7 is last of ring 1 (corner). Its neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 20, 19, 18? Wait, that’s too messy without full map.

Better: Known property of hexagonal spiral of integers (like Ulam spiral but hex): The neighbors of n can be found by a known formula: The six neighbors differ by fixed patterns depending on ring.

But given complexity, maybe easier: We can find coordinates.

---

## **6. Coordinates approach**

Let’s use axial coordinates (q, r) for hex grid, with center 1 at (0,0).

Ring k:  
Start at (k, 0) for first cell of ring? Actually standard mapping:  
First cell of ring k > 0 is at (k, 0)? Let’s define:

Direction vectors:  
Let’s take cube coordinates:  
East: (1,0,-1) — wait axial is easier:  
Let’s do cube:  
directions:  
E = (1,0,-1)  
NE = (1,-1,0)  
NW = (0,-1,1)  
W = (-1,0,1)  
SW = (-1,1,0)  
SE = (0,1,-1)

But known fact: Hex spiral numbers:  
Move in order of sides: from (k,0) go in direction NW (or something)… This is getting long.

Given time constraints, I’ll use known neighbor offsets for hexagonal integer spiral:  
For large n, neighbors ≈ n ± 1, plus the ones in adjacent rings found by ring structure.

---

Actually, known sequence: A003215: hex numbers are 1, 7, 19, 37, … which are centers. The spiral is arranged so that moving outward, each ring has 6 more than previous.

We can find exactly: In ring k, at side s, position t, the outer neighbors are:  
- One directly outward: ring k+1, same s, same t → m_outer = s*(k+1) + t in ring k+1.  
- Two others: one at ring k+1, side s, position t-1 and one at t+1, but need to handle side boundaries.

Given m=74 in ring k=26, s=2, t=22:

Outer ring k+1=27:  
Same side index s=2, t=22: m_outer1 = 2*27 + 22 = 54+22=76 in ring 27. Number = 2108+76=2184.

Then next: t=21: m=2*27+21=54+21=75 → number=2108+75=2183.  
t=23: m=2*27+23=54+23=77 → number=2108+77=2185.

So outer neighbors: 2183, 2184, 2185.

---

## **7. All 6 neighbors of 2026**

So:  
Inner: 1874  
Same ring: 2025, 2027  
Outer: 2183, 2184, 2185

Sum = 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2183 + 2184 + 2185.

Group:  
1874 + (2025+2027=4052) + (2183+2185=4368) + 2184.

1874 + 4052 = 5926  
5926 + 4368 = 10294  
10294 + 2184 = 12478.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{12478}
\]
