Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

## 1. Understanding the spiral layout

The problem says:  
"natural numbers written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid"  
and gives a snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

This is a **hexagonal spiral** starting at 1 in the center.

Let's label positions relative to the center (1):

From the snippet:

- Center cell: 1  
- Neighbors of 1: going clockwise starting from east: 2 (E), 9 (NE), 10 (NW), 14 (W), 15 (SW), 16 (S), 6 (SE), but wait — careful:  
Actually, in a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. Let's list them systematically.

---

### Neighbors of 1 from the given arrangement:

Looking at the grid:

Row above 1: `14  4  3  10`  
Row of 1: `15  5  1  2  9`  
Row below 1: `16  6  7  8`

Positions (rough coordinates in axial coordinates for hex grid):

Let’s assign coordinates to center 1 as (0,0).

From the layout:

- East neighbor of 1: 2 → (1,0)  
- North-East neighbor of 1: 9 → (1,-1)  
- North-West neighbor of 1: 10 → (0,-1)  
- West neighbor of 1: 14 → (-1,0)  
- South-West neighbor of 1: 15 → (-1,1)  
- South-East neighbor of 1: 6 → (0,1)

Check:  
Neighbors of 1: 2(E), 9(NE), 10(NW), 14(W), 15(SW), 6(SE). Yes, 6 neighbors.

## 2. Understanding the spiral numbering rule

We need to know how numbers are placed on the spiral so we can locate 2026 and its neighbors.

This is a well-known "hexagonal spiral" sequence (OEIS A003215 sometimes, but actually that's hex numbers; the growth is like honeycomb).

Let’s see the rings:

Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)  
Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers)  
Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)  
Ring k: numbers from 6*k*(k-1)/2 + 2? Wait, let's derive.

Actually, known formula:  
Number of hex cells in ring r (r>=1) = 6*r.  
Total numbers up to ring r: 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + r) = 1 + 6*(r(r+1)/2) = 1 + 3r(r+1).

Check:  
r=0: total=1  
r=1: total=1+6=7 (numbers 1..7)  
r=2: total=1+6+12=19 (numbers 1..19)  
r=3: total=1+6+12+18=37, etc.

So last number in ring r = 3r(r+1)+1.

---

## 3. Which ring contains 2026?

Solve 3r(r+1)+1 ≈ 2026.

3r²+3r+1 = 2026  
3r²+3r-2025=0  
r²+r-675=0  
Discriminant=1+2700=2701.  
√2701 ≈ 51.97.  
r=(-1+51.97)/2≈25.48.

So r=25: last number = 3*25*26+1=1950+1=1951.  
r=26: last number = 3*26*27+1=2106+1=2107.

So 2026 is in ring 26.

---

## 4. Position of 2026 in ring 26

Ring 26 has 6*26=156 numbers, starting at 1952, ending at 2107.

Segment length per side in ring r = r numbers per side? Actually in hexagonal spiral, ring r has 6 sides, each of length r. Yes.

So ring 26: side length = 26.

Numbering starts at 1952 in the "East" side, going counterclockwise (if center 1 had 2 on East side, then each ring starts just after the previous ring's last number, moving SE to E corner then going around).

We need to find coordinates of 2026.

---

Offset within ring 26: 2026 - 1952 = 74.

Sides:  
Side 1 (East): 1952 to 1952+25=1977 (26 numbers: 1952..1977)  
Side 2 (NE): 1978 to 1978+25=2003  
Side 3 (NW): 2004 to 2004+25=2029  

So 2026 is in side 3 (NW side), offset along that side = 2026 - 2004 = 22nd number along that side (0-indexed: 2004 is index 0, so 2026 is index 22).

Side length=26, so index 22 means it's not near a corner (corners are at index 0 and index 25 of each side).

---

## 5. Coordinates of 2026

Better to assign coordinates systematically:

Start: ring 0: (0,0)=1.

Ring 1:  
Start from (1,0)=2, go NE to (1,-1)=3? Wait, check small numbers:

Actually known spiral:  
1 at (0,0)  
Ring 1:  
(1,0)=2, (0,-1)=3, (-1,-1)=4, (-1,0)=5, (-1,1)=6, (0,1)=7.

Ring 2: start (2,-1)=8, etc. But maybe easier to use axial coordinates (q,r) and known movement:  
From end of ring r-1 at (r,0)?? Actually the pattern:  

Let’s define coordinates:  
q = east/northwest axis, r = north/south axis? Let’s do axial coordinates (q,r) with directions:  
E = (1,0), NE = (1,-1), NW = (0,-1), W = (-1,0), SW = (-1,1), SE = (0,1).

Ring r: starts at (r,0) with number n=3r(r-1)+2, then goes:  
NW r steps, W r steps, SW r steps, SE r steps, E r steps, NE r steps.

Check r=1: start (1,0)=2, NW 1 step→(1,-1)=3? That’s actually NE? Let's test known layout:

Given layout:  
1(0,0), neighbors: 2(1,0), 9(1,-1), 10(0,-1), 14(-1,0), 15(-1,1), 6(0,1).  
So ring 1: 2(1,0), 3(1,-1), 4(0,-1), 5(-1,-1), 6(-1,0), 7(0,1) — hmm mismatch with given? Actually given has 3 at (1,-1)? Let's reconcile later, but maybe not needed.

---

Better: We can find neighbors without full coordinates by using relative positions in the spiral:  
In a hexagonal spiral, each number’s neighbors are at ring r-1, same ring r, and ring r+1 depending on the side and position.

But easier: Use the fact that along a flat side (not corner), a cell’s neighbors are:  
- two in the same ring (previous and next in spiral order)  
- one in previous ring (inward neighbor)  
- one in next ring (outward neighbor)  
- plus the two other neighbors: one in previous ring and one in next ring, but need careful.

Actually known property: For a cell in ring r, index k along a side (0-based, not at corner), its neighbors are:  
1. Previous cell in ring: n-1  
2. Next cell in ring: n+1  
3. Inward neighbor (ring r-1)  
4. Outward neighbor (ring r+1)  
5. Second inward neighbor (ring r-1)  
6. Second outward neighbor (ring r+1)  

But simpler: Let’s locate 2026 and compute its 6 neighbors by formula.

---

## 6. Use known neighbor offsets for honeycomb sequence

There’s a known sequence: hexagonal spiral of integers. We can determine the six neighbors of m by finding ring and side position.

Let’s try small example to guess pattern:

Take n=8 (start of ring 3? Actually ring 2: numbers 8..19).  
Given snippet extended:  
Ring2: 8 at SE side? Actually let's skip full reconstruction; too long.

Better: Let’s just compute for 2026 using known structure:

Ring r=26, side=NW (third side), index t=22 along side.

On a hexagonal grid, each cell’s neighbors:  
Let’s define side directions: sides in order: E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE.

We can find relative to corners: The inward neighbor (toward center) is at ring r-1, same angle. The formula: inward index = (r-1)*t/r roughly? Actually along a side, the inward neighbor is at ring r-1, same relative position t, but sides shrink, so t maps to t'=t if t<r-1, else t'=r-2.

Given t=22, r=26, inward neighbor in ring 25 at same side position index t=22 (since t<25).  

Numbering: ring 25: numbers 1951 is last of ring 24? Wait, ring 25 last number=3*25*26+1=1951. Ring 25 numbers: 1952? No, ring 25 starts at 1952? Wait earlier: ring 25 last=1951? That’s wrong: check:

r=1: last=7  
r=2: last=19  
Formula last=3r(r+1)+1:  
r=25: last=3*25*26+1=1951. Yes. So ring 26 starts at 1952.

So ring 25 numbers: from 3*24*25+1+1=1801 to 1951.

Side length in ring 25 = 25.

So inward neighbor: side NW of ring 25, index t=22 (since t<25), so number = start of NW side in ring 25 + t.

Start of NW side in ring 25:  
Ring 25 starts at 1801.  
Sides: E:1801..1825, NE:1826..1850, NW:1851..1875.

So NW side start=1851, index 22 → 1851+22=1873.

So inward neighbor = 1873.

Outward neighbor: ring 27, side NW, index t=23 (since t<27), start of NW side in ring 27: ring 27 starts at 2108. Sides: E:2108..2133 (26 numbers), NE:2134..2159, NW:2160..2185. Index 23 → 2160+23=2183.

So outward neighbor = 2183.

---

## 7. Same-ring neighbors:

Previous in spiral: 2025. Next in spiral: 2027.

---

## 8. Other two neighbors:

In hex grid: other two neighbors: one in ring r-1, one in ring r+1, adjacent along grid but not along spiral path.

For a cell on NW side, index t, the other inward neighbor is on ring r-1, side NE, index t+1 if t<r-1, else special at corner. Here t=22, r=26, t+1=23<25, so valid.

Ring 25, side NE: start=1826, index 23 → 1826+23=1849.

Other outward neighbor: ring r+1, side NE, index t-1 if t>0. Here t=22, t-1=21.

Ring 27, side NE: start=2134, index 21 → 2134+21=2155.

---

## 9. All 6 neighbors of 2026:

1. 2025 (previous in ring)  
2. 2027 (next in ring)  
3. 1873 (inward)  
4. 2183 (outward)  
5. 1849 (other inward)  
6. 2155 (other outward)

Sum = 2025+2027+1873+2183+1849+2155.

Group: 2025+2027=4052.  
1873+2183=4056.  
1849+2155=4004.

Sum = 4052+4056+4004 = 4052+4056=8108, +4004=12112.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12112}
\]
