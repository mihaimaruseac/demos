The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center is layer 0: 1.

Layer 1 (hexagon around center): 2 (east), 3 (northeast), 4 (northwest), 5 (west), 6 (southwest), 7 (southeast), 8 (back to east, completing the layer).

Higher layers follow similarly, with the last number of layer \(k\) being \(3k(k+1)\).

Solve \(3k(k+1) \geq 2026\): \(k = 25\), since \(3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1950 < 2026\) and \(3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 2106 > 2026\).

Thus, 2026 is in layer 25, position \(2026 - 1950 = 76\) along the layer (which has 156 positions).

Layer 25 has 6 sides of 26 numbers each. Position 76 is on side 3 (northwest), 6 steps inward from the corner.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous in layer)
- 2027 (next in layer)
- 1951 (end of layer 24)
- 2020 (25 steps back in layer 25)
- 1949 (from layer 24)
- 1952 (from layer 24)

Sum: \(2025 + 2027 + 1951 + 2020 + 1949 + 1952 = 11924\).
