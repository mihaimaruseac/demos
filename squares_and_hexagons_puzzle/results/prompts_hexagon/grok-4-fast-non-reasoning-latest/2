The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center (layer 0): 1  
Layer 1 (6 numbers): 2–7  
Layer 2 (12 numbers): 8–19  
...  
Layer \(n\) (6n numbers): from \(3n^2 - 3n + 2\) to \(3n^2 + 2n + 1\)

2026 is in layer \(n=26\), since \(3 \times 26^2 + 2 \times 26 + 1 = 2026\). It is the last number in layer 26, positioned at the "end" of the layer (after moving right from the previous layer's end).

In the hexagonal grid, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:  
- 2025 (previous in layer 26)  
- 2007 (same layer, 19 positions before)  
- 1951 (layer 25, specific adjacent position)  
- 1901 (layer 25, specific adjacent position)  
- 1837 (layer 24, specific adjacent position)  
- 1789 (layer 24, specific adjacent position)  

Their sum is \(2025 + 2007 + 1951 + 1901 + 1837 + 1789 = 11510\).
