The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding 6 more numbers. The number 2026 is in layer \( n = 26 \), where the side length is 26 and the layer contains numbers from 1277 to 2026.

The position of 2026 is at the end of the layer, specifically at coordinate \( (26, 0) \) in axial coordinates (q, r), where q is the column and r is the row in the hexagonal grid.

The six neighbors in the hexagonal grid are at positions:
- \( (25, 0) \)
- \( (26, -1) \)
- \( (25, -1) \)
- \( (26, 1) \)
- \( (27, 0) \)
- \( (27, -1) \)

These positions contain the numbers 1969, 1970, 1971, 2025, 2027, and 2028, respectively.

Their sum is \( 1969 + 1970 + 1971 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 = 11990 \).
