The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center is layer 0: 1.

Layer 1 (hexagon around center): 2 (east), 3 (northeast), 4 (northwest), 5 (west), 6 (southwest), 7 (southeast), 8 (back to east, completing the layer).

Layer 2 starts at 9 (east of 2), and so on.

Each layer \(k \geq 1\) has \(6k\) numbers, with the last number in layer \(k\) being \(N_k = 3k(k+1)\).

Solve \(3k(k+1) \geq 2026\): \(k^2 + k - 675.\overline{3} \geq 0\), so \(k = 26\) (since \(N_{25} = 1950 < 2026 < 2028 = N_{26}\)).

Thus, 2026 is in layer 26, position \(2026 - 1950 = 76\) in the layer (1-based indexing from the east-starting side).

Layer 26 has 156 numbers; position 76 is on the 5th side (northwest), specifically the 10th position on that side (counting from the start of the side).

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 1951 (inward, layer 25)
- 2025 (previous on same side)
- 2027 (next on same side)
- 2003 (previous side, northeast)
- 2051 (next side, west)
- 1990 (adjacent on southwest side of layer 25)

Sum: \(1951 + 2025 + 2027 + 2003 + 2051 + 1990 = 12047\).
