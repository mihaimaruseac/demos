The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center is layer 0: 1.

Layer 1 (hexagon around center): 2 (east), 3 (northeast), 4 (northwest), 5 (west), 6 (southwest), 7 (southeast), 8 (back to east, completing the layer).

Higher layers follow similarly, with the southeast corner of layer \(k\) being \(3k(k-1) + 1\).

To find the layer of 2026: solve \(3k(k-1) + 1 \leq 2026 < 3(k+1)k + 1\).

\(3k^2 - 3k + 1 \approx 2026\), so \(k^2 - k - 675 \approx 0\), \(k \approx 26.5\). Testing \(k=26\): southeast = 1921, end = 2024. \(k=27\): southeast = 2026 exactly.

Thus, 2026 is the southeast corner of layer 27.

The 6 neighbors in the hexagonal grid are:

- East: 2027 (next number, layer 27 east side)
- Northeast: 1950 (northwest corner of layer 26)
- Northwest: 1922 (east after southeast of layer 26)
- West: 1895 (southwest corner of layer 26)
- Southwest: 1894 (west before southwest of layer 26)
- Southeast: 8 (southeast of layer 1; opposite side)

Sum: \(2027 + 1950 + 1922 + 1895 + 1894 + 8 = 9796\).
