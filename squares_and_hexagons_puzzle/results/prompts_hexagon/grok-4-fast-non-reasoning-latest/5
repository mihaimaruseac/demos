The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The number 2026 is in layer \( n = 26 \), where the side length is 26 and the largest number in the layer is \( 3n^2 = 2028 \). Specifically, 2026 is the second number from the end in the bottom-right direction of layer 26.

Its six neighbors are:
- 2025 (previous in layer)
- 2027 (next in layer)
- 1903 (previous layer, bottom-right)
- 1950 (previous layer, right)
- 1997 (previous layer, top-right)
- 2149 (next layer, bottom-right)

The sum is \( 2025 + 2027 + 1903 + 1950 + 1997 + 2149 = 12051 \).
