The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The number 2026 is in layer \( n = 26 \), where the side length is 26 and the layer contains 156 numbers (from 1871 to 2026). Specifically, 2026 is the last number in the layer, positioned at the end of the bottom-right side.

Its six neighbors are:
- 2025 (previous in layer)
- 1870 (end of previous layer)
- 1703 (start of previous layer)
- 1704
- 1871
- 2020 (10 positions before in the layer)

Their sum is \( 2025 + 1870 + 1703 + 1704 + 1871 + 2020 = 11{,}193 \).

## Explanation

The hexagonal spiral is structured with 1 at the center, and each subsequent layer forms a hexagonal ring around the previous ones, increasing the side length by 1 per layer. The total numbers up to layer \( n \) follow the formula \( 3n(n-1) + 1 \), so solving \( 3n(n-1) + 1 \leq 2026 < 3(n+1)n + 1 \) yields \( n = 26 \), as layer 25 ends at 1870 and layer 26 runs from 1871 to 2026.

Within layer 26, which has 156 numbers, 2026 is the final number, located at the end of the bottom-right side of the hexagon. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors: the adjacent cell in the layer (2025), the cell before it in the layer (2020, 10 positions prior due to the spiral path), and four cells from the previous layer (layer 25).

The previous layer (25) ends at 1870 and starts at 1704, with 1703 being the last of layer 24. These positions connect to 2026 based on the spiral's counterclockwise path around the hexagon. Thus, the neighbors are 2025, 2020, 1871 (start of layer 26), 1870 (end of layer 25), 1704 (start of layer 25), and 1703 (end of layer 24).

Summing these values: \( 2025 + 2020 + 1871 + 1870 + 1704 + 1703 = 11{,}193 \).
