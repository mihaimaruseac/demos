The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center. Each layer k (starting from k=0 for the center) adds 6k numbers, with the largest number in layer k being the triangular number T_k = k(k+1)/2. For 2026, solve k(k+1)/2 ≥ 2026 to find k=63 (since T_63=2016 and T_64=2080), so 2026 is in layer 63 at local position 2026-2016=10 (0-indexed from the southeast ring position).

The 6 neighbors are the adjacent cells in the 6 directions: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast. Their local positions relative to 2026 are -64, -63, 1, 37, 38, 64. Adjusting for layer boundaries, the global numbers are 1963, 1964, 2027, 2053, 2054, 2090. Their sum is 26.
