The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center is layer 0: 1.

Layer 1 (hexagon around center): 2 (east), 3 (northeast), 4 (northwest), 5 (west), 6 (southwest), 7 (southeast), 8 (back to east, completing the layer).

Layer 2 starts at 9 (east of 2), and so on.

Each layer \(k \geq 1\) has \(6k\) numbers, with the last number of layer \(k\) being \(N_k = 3k(k+1)\).

Solve \(3k(k+1) \geq 2026\) for the smallest such \(k\): \(k=25\), since \(N_{25} = 1950\) and \(N_{26} = 2028\).

Thus, 2026 is in layer 26, position \(2026 - 1950 = 76\) (1-based index in the layer).

Layer 26 has 156 numbers, directions cycled as: east (1-26), northeast (27-52), northwest (53-78), west (79-104), southwest (105-130), southeast (131-156).

Position 76 is in northwest, offset \(76 - 52 = 24\) (1-based, so 23 steps from start of northwest).

The starting cell of northwest in layer 26 is the same as the ending cell of northwest in layer 25, which is number 1877 (calculated via layer formulas).

From there, move 23 steps along the northwest direction (northwestward).

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous in layer)
- 2027 (next in layer)
- 1950 (inward, layer 25)
- 2028 (outward, layer 27 start)
- Two side neighbors in layer 26: 2002 and 2051.

Their sum is \(2025 + 2027 + 1950 + 2028 + 2002 + 2051 = 12063\).
