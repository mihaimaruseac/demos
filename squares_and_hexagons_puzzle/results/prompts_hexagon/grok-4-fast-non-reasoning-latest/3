The hexagonal spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward counterclockwise, with each layer adding numbers in a specific order around the hexagon.

The center is layer 0: 1.

Layer 1 (hexagon around center): 2 (east), 3 (northeast), 4 (northwest), 5 (west), 6 (southwest), 7 (southeast), 8 (east of 7, completing the layer).

Layer 2 starts at 9 (east of 8), and so on.

Each layer \(k \geq 1\) has \(6k\) numbers, with the last number in layer \(k\) being \(N_k = 3k(k+1)\).

Solve \(3k(k+1) \geq 2026\) for the smallest such \(k\): \(k=25\), since \(N_{25} = 1950\) and \(N_{26} = 2028 > 2026\).

Thus, 2026 is in layer 26, position \(2026 - 1950 = 76\) (1-based index in the layer).

Layer 26 has 156 numbers. The directions cycle as: east (1), northeast (26), northwest (26), west (26), southwest (26), southeast (31, but only up to 76 total).

- East: 1 number (1951)
- NE: 26 numbers (1952–1977)
- NW: 26 numbers (1978–2003)
- West: 26 numbers (2004–2029, but layer ends at 2028)

Position 76 falls in the west arm: positions 52–77 (west start: 2004 at pos 52, 2005 at 53, ..., 2026 at 76, 2027 at 77, 2028 at 78).

The west arm runs westward (left along the south side of the layer-25 hexagon).

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- North: 2020 (layer 25)
- Northeast: 1977 (layer 26, end of NE arm)
- Northwest: 2003 (layer 26, end of NW arm)
- South: 1951 (layer 25, start of layer 26 east)
- Southwest: 1950 (layer 25, end)
- Southeast: 2027 (layer 26, next in west arm)

Sum: \(2020 + 1977 + 2003 + 1951 + 1950 + 2027 = 11928\).
