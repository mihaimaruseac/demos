The number 2026 is on layer 27 of the hexagonal grid. Its six neighbors consist of the previous and next numbers in the spiral, which are 2025 and 2027, and four numbers on layer 26.

The four numbers on layer 26 are assumed to be 2026 - 27, 2026 - 26, 2026 - 25, and 2026 - 24, which are 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.

The sum of the neighbors is:  
2025 + 2027 + 1999 + 2000 + 2001 + 2002

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052  
Then, 1999 + 2000 + 2001 + 2002 = 8002  
Finally, 4052 + 8002 = 12054

\[
\boxed{00012054}
\]
