I need to find the 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. On a hexagonal grid, numbers spiral outward from the center in rings[4]. Each ring k has a circumference of 6k hexagons[4]. The total number of hexagons up to and including ring N is \(1 + 3N(N+1)\)[4].

To find which ring 2026 is in, I need to solve: \(1 + 3N(N+1) \geq 2026\)

This gives approximately \(3N^2 + 3N + 1 \geq 2026\), so \(3N^2 + 3N \geq 2025\), yielding \(N^2 + N \geq 675\). Testing: \(N = 25\) gives \(625 + 25 = 650\) (too small), and \(N = 26\) gives \(676 + 26 = 702\) (sufficient).

Ring 25 contains numbers from \(1 + 3(25)(26) = 1951\) through \(1 + 3(26)(27) = 2107\). Since \(1951 < 2026 < 2107\), the number 2026 is in ring 26.

Within ring 26, the position is \(2026 - 1950 = 76\). Ring 26 has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) cells, so position 76 is in the second half of the ring.

On a hexagonal grid, each interior cell has exactly 6 neighbors. When a number is on the spiral, its neighbors are the cells immediately adjacent in the hexagonal grid. These neighbors include:
- The number immediately before it on the spiral (moving backward along the spiral)
- The number immediately after it on the spiral (moving forward along the spiral)  
- Four other neighbors in the hexagonal grid

Based on the spiral structure[2], for a number at position p in ring r, the neighbors can be determined by the hexagonal geometry. The six neighbors of 2026 would be:
- 2025 and 2027 (consecutive on the spiral)
- Four neighbors from adjacent positions in the ring and adjacent rings

For a hexagonal spiral where numbers increase outward[4], the six neighbors of 2026 would be the numbers at positions corresponding to the six adjacent hexagons. By the symmetry of hexagonal grids and spiral construction, if 2026 is at some position in ring 26, its neighbors include:
- 2025 and 2027 from the spiral sequence
- Approximately 2000, 2001, 2051, 2052 (rough estimates from adjacent ring positions)

However, without the exact geometric position within the ring or access to the complete spiral coordinates, I cannot determine the precise neighbors. The search results discuss hexagonal coordinate systems[3] and spiral algorithms[4][6], but don't provide a formula for directly computing neighbors at a given spiral position.

To answer this definitively, I would need either: (1) the explicit mapping of positions to coordinates on the hexagonal grid, or (2) a formula relating a number's position on the spiral to its six neighbors' positions. The search results describe *how* to construct such spirals but not how to query specific neighbor relationships for arbitrary large numbers like 2026.
