I need to find the six neighbors of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. The numbers start at 1 in the center and spiral outward on a hexagonal grid. Based on the search results, the spiral expands in concentric rings, with each ring containing \(6k\) hexagons for the \(k\)-th ring[5].

**Identifying which ring contains 2026:**

The total number of hexagons through ring \(N\) is \(1 + 3N(N+1)\)[5].

For ring 25: \(1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951\)
For ring 26: \(1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107\)

Since 1951 < 2026 < 2107, the number 2026 is in ring 26.

**Finding the position within ring 26:**

Ring 26 contains numbers from 1952 to 2107 (156 numbers total, since \(6 \times 26 = 156\)).

Position within ring 26: \(2026 - 1951 = 75\)

So 2026 is the 75th number in the 26th ring.

**Determining neighbors in a hexagonal spiral:**

On a hexagonal grid, each cell has exactly 6 neighbors[1][5]. In the spiral pattern described in the search results, as we traverse each ring, the neighbors of a number include:
- The two adjacent numbers in the same ring (positions 74 and 76)
- Four numbers in the surrounding rings

For a number at position 75 in ring 26:
- Previous in ring: \(2026 - 1 = 2025\)
- Next in ring: \(2026 + 1 = 2027\)

The other four neighbors are in rings 25 and 27. Based on the spiral geometry where each ring is traversed systematically, the neighbors from the inner ring (ring 25) and outer ring (ring 27) correspond to positions that maintain the hexagonal structure.

**Calculating neighbor positions:**

For position 75 in ring 26 (where the ring has 156 positions):
- Same ring neighbors: 2025, 2027
- Ring 25 neighbors: These are at the corresponding positions in ring 25. Position 75 in ring 26 maps to approximately position \(\frac{75 \times 150}{156} \approx 72.1\), giving neighbors around positions 72-73 in ring 25, which are 1951 - 150 + 72 = 1873 and 1874
- Ring 27 neighbors: Position 75 in ring 26 maps forward to ring 27 at approximately position \(\frac{75 \times 162}{156} \approx 77.9\), giving neighbors around positions 77-78 in ring 27, which are 2107 + 77 = 2184 and 2185

More precisely, using the hexagonal spiral geometry[5], the six neighbors of position 75 in ring 26 are:
- 2025, 2027 (adjacent in same ring)
- Approximately: 1873, 1874 (from ring 25)
- Approximately: 2184, 2185 (from ring 27)

**Sum of neighbors:**

\(2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168\)

However, without access to explicit coordinate mappings or computational verification from the search results, this calculation relies on geometric interpolation. The search results provide the general framework for hexagonal spiral generation but don't include the specific neighbor calculation algorithm needed for precise verification at position 2026.

**The sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is approximately 12168**, though exact verification would require implementing the full spiral coordinate system described in the search results.
