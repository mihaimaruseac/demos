Looking at the hexagonal spiral where natural numbers are laid out starting from 1 at the center, I need to determine the positions of the neighbors of 2026 and calculate their sum.

## Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral Structure

In a hexagonal grid spiral, numbers expand outward in concentric rings. Each ring *k* (where k=0 is the center) contains 6*k* cells, with ring boundaries at 1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, etc.[1] These follow the pattern 3n² + 3n + 1 for ring boundaries.

To find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 25: 3(625) + 3(25) + 1 = 1951
- Ring 26: 3(676) + 3(26) + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26 (which contains positions 1952-2107, a total of 156 cells).

## Finding the Position Within the Ring

Position within ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Each of the 6 sides of ring 26 has 26 cells. The position 75 falls on the 3rd side (cells 53-78), specifically at position 23 of that side.

## Key Mathematical Pattern

On a hexagonal grid spiral, consecutive numbers along the **straight line progressions** (the six main directions through the center) follow quadratic relationships[1]. Specifically, one of these lines contains numbers satisfying: 3x² + x + 1

This line contains: 1, 5, 15, 31, 53, 81, 115, 155, 201, 253, ...

The neighbors of any number include its adjacent cells in the spiral plus the radial neighbors along related quadratic sequences.

## The Six Neighbors of 2026

For a number on the spiral at ring 26, position 75, the six neighbors are:
- **2025** (previous in spiral sequence)
- **2027** (next in spiral sequence)
- **1975** (position 75 in ring 25, one ring inward)
- **1949** (position 74 in ring 25, one ring inward)
- **2051** (position 76 in ring 27, one ring outward)
- **2077** (position 102 in ring 27, one ring outward)

## Calculating the Sum

2025 + 2027 + 1975 + 1949 + 2051 + 2077 = **12,104**
