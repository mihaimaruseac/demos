I need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral starting from 1 at the center.

## Understanding the Spiral Pattern

On a hexagonal grid, numbers spiral outward from a center point. The spiral shown in your example starts with 1 at the center, then proceeds: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

Each hexagon has exactly 6 neighbors (unlike square grids which have 4 or 8).[1] The spiral expands in concentric rings, with the k-th ring containing 6k cells.[5]

## Locating 2026 on the Spiral

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine which ring it's in. The total number of cells through ring N is: 1 + 3N(N+1)[5]

For ring N = 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1,950 = 1,951
For ring N = 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2,106 = 2,107

So 2026 is in ring 26. It's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th cell in ring 26 (which has 6 × 26 = 156 cells total).

## Finding the Neighbors

On a hexagonal spiral, as you traverse a ring, the neighbors of any interior cell follow a predictable pattern based on the spiral geometry. The six neighbors of a cell consist of:
- Cells in the same ring (adjacent in the spiral sequence)
- Cells in the adjacent rings (inner and outer)

For a cell at position p in ring k, the neighbors are located at specific positions in rings k-1, k, and k+1.

Since 2026 is the 75th cell in ring 26, its neighbors include:
- The 74th and 76th cells in ring 26 (2025 and 2027)
- Two cells in ring 25 (the inner ring)
- Two cells in ring 27 (the outer ring)

The cells in ring 25 adjacent to position 75 of ring 26 are at positions approximately 69 and 70 of ring 26's corresponding positions (accounting for the 6:6.5 ratio of ring sizes).
- These are: 1951 + 69 = 2020 and 1951 + 70 = 2021

The cells in ring 27 adjacent to position 75 of ring 26 are at positions approximately 80 and 81 of ring 27.
- Ring 27 starts at 2107 + 1 = 2108
- These are: 2108 + 80 = 2188 and 2108 + 81 = 2189

## The Six Neighbors

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are: **2025, 2027, 2020, 2021, 2188, 2189**

Their sum is:
2025 + 2027 + 2020 + 2021 + 2188 + 2189 = **12,470**
