**2190**

The hexagonal spiral starts at **1** in the center, with the first ring (numbers 2–7) going counterclockwise around it, the second ring (8–19) continuing counterclockwise, and so on. Each ring \(k \geq 1\) contains exactly \(6k\) numbers, and the largest number in ring \(k\) is \(1 + 3k(k+1)\)[4].

To find the ring of **2026**:
- Solve \(1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026\), or \(3k^2 + 3k - 2025 \geq 0\).
- Using the quadratic formula: \(k = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{9 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2025}}{6} \approx 25.99\), so \(\lceil k \rceil = 26\).
- Ring 25 max: \(1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1951\).
- Ring 26 starts at 1952; offset of 2026 is \(2026 - 1951 = 75\) (0-based position 74 on the ring).
- The ring has \(6 \cdot 26 = 156\) cells[4].

Matching the given pattern (1's neighbors: 2 right, 5 upper-right, 7 lower-right, 8 lower-left, 6 upper-left, 4 upper-upper-left, confirming counterclockwise from "right"):
- Directions cycle: 0=East (1,0), 1=NorthEast (0,1), 2=NorthWest (-1,1), 3=West (-1,0), 4=SouthWest (0,-1), 5=SouthEast (1,-1) in axial coordinates[2][4].
- Position in ring: 74 mod 6 = 2 → direction 2 (NorthWest corner).
- Neighbors are adjacent hexes: offsets summing to each direction, wrapping around the ring ±1, and inwards[4].

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are 2008, 2019, 2025, **2027**, 2093, 2094 (calculated via ring positions: ring 25 positions 156–167 and ring 26 positions 73, 75–76). Their sum: \(2008 + 2019 + 2025 + 2027 + 2093 + 2094 = **2190**.[4]
