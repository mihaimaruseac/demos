To solve this problem, we need to find the neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid and then calculate the sum of their values.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.

To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral.

The spiral starts with the number 1 in the center, and the subsequent numbers are arranged in a clockwise direction, with each new layer adding 6 numbers.

The sequence of the numbers in the spiral is:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...

To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to locate the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify the six surrounding numbers.

Step 1: Determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.
The numbers in the spiral increase by 1 in each subsequent position.
The position of 2026 can be calculated as 2026 - 1 = 2025.
Since the spiral adds 6 numbers in each layer, the position of 2026 is in the 338th layer (2025 / 6 = 337.5, rounded up to 338).

Step 2: Identify the six neighbors of 2026.
The six neighbors of 2026 are the numbers surrounding it in the 338th layer of the spiral.
The six neighbors are:
2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 2028, 2029

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the six neighbors.
Sum of the six neighbors = 2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12156.
