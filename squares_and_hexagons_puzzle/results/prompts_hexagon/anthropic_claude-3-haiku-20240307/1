To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the numbers on the hexagonal grid.

The natural numbers are arranged in a spiral, with the first number in the center and the subsequent numbers forming a spiral pattern.

The numbers on the hexagonal grid are arranged as follows:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

The number 2026 is not directly given in the problem statement, but we can determine its position on the grid by following the spiral pattern.

The spiral pattern goes like this:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, ...

So, the number 2026 would be the 2026th number in the spiral.

To find the 6 neighbors of 2026, we need to look at the 6 adjacent positions on the hexagonal grid.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
1. 2025
2. 2024
3. 2027
4. 2028
5. 2029
6. 2030

The sum of these 6 neighbors is:
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 12163.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12163.
