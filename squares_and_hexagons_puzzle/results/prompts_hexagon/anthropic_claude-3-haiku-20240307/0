To solve this problem, we need to find the location of the number 2026 on the spiral and then identify its 6 neighboring numbers.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- The pattern of the spiral is: ... 14 4 3 10 ..., .. 15 5 1 2 9 ..., ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Step 1: Identify the location of the number 2026 on the spiral.
The numbers on the spiral are increasing in a clockwise direction, and the spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid.
By observing the pattern, we can see that the number 2026 would be located on the 169th position on the spiral.

Step 2: Identify the 6 neighboring numbers of 2026.
The 6 neighboring numbers of 2026 are the numbers immediately adjacent to it on the hexagonal grid.
The 6 neighboring numbers of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighboring numbers.
Sum of the 6 neighboring numbers = 2025 + 2027 + 2018 + 2019 + 2020 + 2021 = 12,130

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12,130.
