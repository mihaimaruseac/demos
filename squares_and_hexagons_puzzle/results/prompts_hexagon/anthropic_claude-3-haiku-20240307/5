To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a hexagonal grid.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- We need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

The spiral pattern can be observed as follows:
- The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal spiral, starting from the center with the number 1.
- The numbers are placed in a counterclockwise direction, with each subsequent ring containing the next set of natural numbers.
- The numbers in each ring follow a specific pattern: the first number in the ring is the previous ring's last number plus 1, and the subsequent numbers in the ring increase by 1.

To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to locate the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its neighboring numbers.

Step 1: Determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.
The numbers in the spiral can be grouped into concentric rings, with the first ring containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The second ring contains the numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
The third ring contains the numbers 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, and so on.

To find the position of 2026, we can count the number of rings until we reach the ring that contains 2026.
The number 2026 is in the 34th ring of the spiral.

Step 2: Identify the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
The 6 neighbors of the number 2026 are the 6 numbers that are adjacent to it in the spiral.
The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighbors.
Sum of the 6 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 = 12156.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12156.
