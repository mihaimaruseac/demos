To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the natural numbers on the hexagonal grid. The spiral starts at the center with the number 1, and the numbers increase in a clockwise direction, with each new layer having six more numbers than the previous layer.

The number 2026 is located in the 71st layer of the spiral. To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026, we need to identify the positions of the 6 neighboring numbers.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
1. The number to the left of 2026: 2025
2. The number to the upper-left of 2026: 2027
3. The number to the upper-right of 2026: 2028
4. The number to the right of 2026: 2029
5. The number to the lower-right of 2026: 2030
6. The number to the lower-left of 2026: 2031

Now, we can calculate the sum of these 6 numbers:

2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 = 12,170

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12,170.
