To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of the natural numbers on the hexagonal grid.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- We need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

The spiral arrangement follows a specific pattern:
- The numbers are arranged in a clockwise direction, starting from the center.
- The numbers increase by 1 in each step, following the spiral pattern.

To find the 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to locate the position of 2026 on the hexagonal grid and identify its immediate neighbors.

The neighbors of a number on the hexagonal grid are the 6 numbers that are adjacent to it, forming a hexagon.

To find the 6 neighbors of 2026, we can follow these steps:
1. Locate the position of 2026 on the hexagonal grid.
2. Identify the 6 numbers that are adjacent to 2026, forming a hexagon.
3. Add up the values of these 6 numbers.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031

The sum of these 6 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 = 12,170

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12,170.
