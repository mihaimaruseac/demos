To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the natural numbers arranged on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.

The given arrangement shows that the natural numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, with the numbers increasing in a clockwise direction.

The neighbors of a given number in this arrangement are the 6 adjacent numbers surrounding it.

To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to first locate the position of 2026 on the grid and then identify its 6 neighbors.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- The number we are interested in is 2026.

Step 1: Locate the position of 2026 on the grid.
The grid is arranged in a spiral pattern, so we can find the position of 2026 by counting the number of spirals from the center (starting from 1) until we reach the spiral containing 2026.

Step 2: Identify the 6 neighbors of 2026.
The 6 neighbors of a number on a hexagonal grid are the 6 adjacent numbers surrounding it.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighbors.
Once we have identified the 6 neighbors of 2026, we can simply add up their values to get the desired sum.

The final answer is the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
