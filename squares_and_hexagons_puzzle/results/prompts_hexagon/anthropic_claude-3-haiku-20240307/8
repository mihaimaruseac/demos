To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of the natural numbers on a hexagonal grid.

The spiral arrangement can be observed as follows:
- The numbers are arranged in a spiral, with each layer of the spiral containing 6 numbers.
- The numbers in each layer increase by 6, starting from the center (1, 7, 13, 19, ...).
- The numbers in each layer are arranged in a specific order: left, top-left, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom-left.

Now, let's find the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

The number 2026 is the 338th number in the spiral arrangement.

To find the 6 neighbors, we need to look at the numbers in the layer immediately before and after the layer containing 2026.

The layer before 2026 contains the numbers: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.
The layer after 2026 contains the numbers: 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
2020, 2021, 2022, 2027, 2028, 2029

The sum of these 6 neighbors is:
2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 12147.
