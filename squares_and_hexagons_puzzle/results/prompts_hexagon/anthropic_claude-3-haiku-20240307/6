To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of the natural numbers on a hexagonal grid.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- We need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement.
The spiral follows a specific pattern, where the numbers increase by 1 as you move clockwise around the hexagon.
For example, the sequence of numbers on the spiral is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and so on.

Step 2: Locate the position of the number 2026 on the spiral.
To find the position of 2026 on the spiral, we can count the number of hexagons from the center until we reach the number 2026.
The number 2026 is located on the 50th hexagon from the center.

Step 3: Identify the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
The 6 neighbors of the number 2026 are the numbers located on the adjacent hexagons:
- Top left: 2025
- Top right: 2027
- Right: 2028
- Bottom right: 2027
- Bottom left: 2025
- Left: 2024

Step 4: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighbors.
Sum of the 6 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2027 + 2025 + 2024 = 12156.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12156.
