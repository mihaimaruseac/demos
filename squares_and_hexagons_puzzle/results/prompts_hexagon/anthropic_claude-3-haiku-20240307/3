To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the natural numbers written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- We need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

Step 1: Identify the position of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid.
The spiral pattern of the natural numbers on the hexagonal grid follows a specific pattern. The numbers increase in a clockwise direction, and the distance between each number increases by 1 as you move outwards.

To find the position of the number 2026, we can count the number of "layers" or "rings" from the center (1) to the number 2026.

The number 2026 is in the 44th layer of the spiral.

Step 2: Identify the 6 neighboring numbers of 2026.
The 6 neighboring numbers of 2026 are:
- The number directly above: 2025
- The number directly below: 2027
- The number to the upper-right: 2045
- The number to the lower-right: 2046
- The number to the upper-left: 2005
- The number to the lower-left: 2006

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 6 neighboring numbers.
Sum of the 6 neighboring numbers = 2025 + 2027 + 2045 + 2046 + 2005 + 2006 = 12154.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12154.
