To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the grid. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has up to 6 neighbors, one in each direction: up, down, and the four diagonal directions.

The pattern of the natural numbers on this hexagonal spiral is as follows:

1. The first cell is cell 1.
2. From there, the numbers increase in a spiral pattern. The direction of the spiral alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise at each complete loop around the center.

To find the position of 2026, we can visualize the spiral expanding outward and count the cells until we reach 2026. However, this is not practical for such a large number, so we need a more systematic approach.

Let's consider the loops of the spiral:
- The 1st loop contains 1 cell (cell 1).
- The 2nd loop contains 6 cells (cells 2 through 7).
- The 3rd loop contains 12 cells (cells 8 through 19).
- ...

We can see that each new loop contains 6 more cells than the previous loop. This is because there are 6 additional cells required to make one complete loop around the center.

Let's find out which loop 2026 is in. We can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to approximate the loop number:

Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n + 1) / 2

We want to find n such that:

n(n + 1) / 2 ≤ 2026 < (n + 1)((n + 1) + 1) / 2

Solving for n gives us an approximation of the loop number. We can then fine-tune this approximation by adding the correct number of loops until we reach just under 2026, and then count the remaining cells.

Let's start with an approximation:

2026 ≈ n^2 / 2
n^2 ≈ 2 * 2026
n ≈ √(2 * 2026)
n ≈ √4052
n ≈ 63.65

Since n must be an integer, we take n = 63. This means 2026 is in the 63rd loop or later. We can calculate the exact number of cells up to the 63rd loop:

Total cells up to the 63rd loop = Sum of the first 63 natural numbers + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + 62)
= 63 * 64 / 2 + 6 * (62 * 63 / 2)
= 63 * 64 / 2 + 6 * 31 * 63
= 63 * (64 / 2 + 6 * 31)
= 63 * (32 + 186)
= 63 * 218
= 13794

Now we need to find how many cells are in the 63rd loop:

Cells in the 63rd loop = 6 * 63 = 378

So, the first cell of the 64th loop is cell 13794 + 378 = 14172. This means 2026 is within the 64th loop.

To find the exact position of 2026, we subtract the number of cells up to the 63rd loop from 2026:

Position in the 64th loop = 2026 - 13794 - 378 = 2026 - 14172 = 64

So, 2026 is the 64th cell in the 64th loop.

Now, we need to determine the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is on the outermost loop, its neighbors will be the cells immediately preceding and following it in the spiral. These will be the last six cells of the 64th loop.

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- The cell immediately before 2026, which is 2025.
- The cell immediately after 2026, which is 2027.
- The four cells that are one step diagonally away, which are 2019, 2031, 2033, and 2015.

To find the exact neighbors, we need to consider the direction of the spiral. Since the 64th loop is even, the spiral direction at this point is counterclockwise. The cells are filled in the following order in the counterclockwise direction: left, up-left, up, up-right, right, down-right.

So the neighbors of 2026 are:
- One cell to the left: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- One cell up-left: 2026 - 7 = 2019 (since we move one cell diagonally and then one cell left)
- One cell up: 2026 - 6 = 2020 (since we move one cell up each loop)
- One cell up-right: 2026 + 5 = 2031 (since we move one cell up-right)
- One cell to the right: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- One cell down-right: 2026 + 7 = 2033 (since we move one cell right and then one cell diagonally)

Now, we can sum the neighbors of 2026:

Sum = 2025 + 2019 + 2020 + 2031 + 2027 + 2033

However, we've made a mistake in the up and down movements. Since we're on an even loop, the movement up and down should be straight, not diagonal. So we need to correct the up and down-right movements:

- One cell up: 2026 - 6 = 2020 (correct)
- One cell down-right: 2026 + 6 = 2032 (since we move one cell right and then one cell down)

Now, let's recalculate the sum with the corrected neighbors:

Sum = 2025 + 2019 + 2020 + 2031 + 2027 + 2032
Sum = 12181

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid is 12181.
