To find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the grid. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, which are directly adjacent to it, one in each of the six directions: up, upper-right, lower-right, down, lower-left, and upper-left.

To visualize this, let's consider a smaller number first, such as 10, and locate it on the grid. The numbers increase as we move to the right, and each new row starts with a number that is one more than the last number in the previous row. When we hit the end of a row, we wrap around to the beginning of the next row. On the hexagonal grid, this means moving down and to the left to start the next row.

Here's a small part of the grid to illustrate the pattern:

```
... 14 4  3 10 ...
.. 15 5  1  2  9 ...
... 16 6  7  8 ...
```

If we were to place 2026 in this grid, we would continue this pattern. Since the grid is infinite, we can't physically place 2026 on it, but we can use the properties of the grid to determine its neighbors.

The key to finding the neighbors of 2026 is to determine its position in the grid. We can do this by calculating its distance from the start of a row. This distance is the remainder when 2026 is divided by the width of the grid. Since the grid's width increases by 1 with each new row, we need to find the row in which 2026 is located and then calculate the remainder.

Let's assume that the width of the row where 2026 is located is `n`. We can find `n` by solving the following inequality:

```
1 + 2 + ... + n > 2026
```

The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula:

```
sum = n(n + 1) / 2
```

We want to find the smallest `n` such that the sum is greater than 2026. We can solve this using a simple loop or by using the quadratic formula. However, since 2026 is a large number, we can approximate the value of `n` by using the quadratic formula:

```
n^2 + n - 4052 > 0
```

Solving this inequality, we find that `n` is approximately 64 (since 64^2 + 64 = 4096, which is just over 2026).

Now, we can calculate the position of 2026 within its row:

```
position_in_row = 2026 mod n
position_in_row = 2026 mod 64
```

Calculating this gives us:

```
position_in_row = 2026 % 64
position_in_row = 46
```

Now, knowing the position of 2026 in its row, we can find its neighbors by adding and subtracting from its position:

- Upper-left neighbor: 2026 - 64 - 1 = 1961
- Left neighbor: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- Lower-left neighbor: 2026 + 64 - 1 = 2091
- Lower-right neighbor: 2026 + 64 = 2090
- Right neighbor: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- Upper-right neighbor: 2026 - 64 + 1 = 1963

Finally, we sum these neighbors:

```
1961 + 2025 + 2091 + 2090 + 2027 + 1963 = 12157
```

So, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 12157.
