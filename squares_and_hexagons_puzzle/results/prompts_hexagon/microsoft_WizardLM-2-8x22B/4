To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to visualize the grid and determine the position of 2026. The hexagonal grid can be thought of as a combination of interleaved triangular grids, one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.

The sequence for the even numbers on the hexagonal grid is as follows:

Even sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...

The sequence for the odd numbers is:

Odd sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...

To find the position of 2026, we first need to determine whether it is even or odd. Since 2026 is even, we will focus on the even sequence.

The even sequence can be divided into segments of 6 numbers, where each segment forms a hexagon around a central number. The sum of the numbers in each hexagon is constant for all hexagons, and it is equal to the central number times 6. This is because each number in the hexagon is exactly 1 less or 1 more than the central number.

For example, the first hexagon around the number 6 (the first central number in the even sequence) contains the numbers 1 to 12, and the sum of these numbers is 6 * 6 = 36.

To find the central number for the hexagon in which 2026 lies, we can divide 2026 by 6 and find the quotient. This quotient will give us the sequence number of the central hexagon number that 2026 is part of.

2026 / 6 = 337 with a remainder (since 2026 is not a multiple of 6).

The central number for the hexagon that contains 2026 is therefore 6 * 337 = 2022.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 relative to this central number. Since 2026 - 2022 = 4, we know that 2026 is 4 steps away from the central number 2022. The numbers that are 4 steps away from the central number on a hexagonal grid form a smaller concentric hexagon.

The six neighbors of the central number that are also part of this smaller hexagon are:

- The central number itself (2022)
- Two numbers that are 1 less than the central number (2021 and 2023)
- Two numbers that are 1 more than the central number (2027 and 2029)
- One number that is 2 less than the central number (2020)
- One number that is 2 more than the central number (2030)

Now, we sum these six neighbors:

2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2027 + 2029 + 2030

This simplifies to:

2 * (2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023) + (2027 + 2029)

We can factor out the common terms:

2 * (2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023) + 2 * 2028

Now, since 2028 is the average of 2027 and 2029, we can rewrite the sum as:

2 * (2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029) / 5

This is simply twice the average of the 10 numbers from 2020 to 2029, which is the same as the sum of these 10 numbers divided by 5.

The sum of these 10 numbers is:

2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 2026 * 10 / 2 = 10130

Now, we divide by 5 to get the sum of the 6 neighbors:

10130 / 5 = 2026

So, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 2026.
