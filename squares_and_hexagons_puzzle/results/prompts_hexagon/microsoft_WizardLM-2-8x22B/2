To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. The grid can be thought of as a series of concentric hexagons, with each side of the hexagon increasing by one as we move outward from the center.

The numbers increase in a counter-clockwise direction around the center, which is occupied by the number 1. The pattern of movement from one number to the next is up, right, down, left, down, right, up, left, and so on, with the direction changing each time we reach a corner of the hexagon.

To find the position of 2026, we need to determine which hexagonal ring it falls on and its position within that ring. We can do this by calculating the numbers in each ring and adding them up until we reach or surpass 2026.

Each ring contains 6 more numbers than the previous one. The first ring has 6 numbers, the second has 12, the third has 18, and so on. The nth ring will have 6n numbers.

Let's calculate the cumulative sum of numbers up to each ring:

1st ring: 6 numbers, max number is 6.
2nd ring: 12 numbers, max number is 6 + 12 = 18.
3rd ring: 18 numbers, max number is 18 + 18 = 36.
...

We can see that the maximum number in each ring is 6 times the ring number squared. We need to find the ring number (n) such that 6n^2 is just greater than 2026.

Let's find n by trial and error:

6 * (1^2) = 6
6 * (2^2) = 24
6 * (3^2) = 54
...
6 * (23^2) = 3174
6 * (24^2) = 3504

We see that 2026 falls between the 24th and 25th rings. Now we need to find the exact position of 2026 within the 24th ring.

The 24th ring starts at 6 * (24^2) + 1 = 3505 and ends at 6 * (24^2) + 6 * 24 = 3624. Since 2026 is within this range, we can calculate its position within the ring.

2026 - 3505 + 1 = 1222

Now we need to find the position of 1222 within the 24th ring, which has 6 * 24 = 144 numbers. To find the position within the ring, we can divide 1222 by the number of numbers in the ring:

1222 mod 144 = 22

This means that 2026 is the 22nd number in the 24th ring.

Since the numbers spiral outwards, we can determine the neighbors by looking at the numbers just before and after 2026 in the sequence. The six neighbors will be the numbers at positions 21, 23, 143, 145, 1221, and 1223 within the spiral.

We can find these positions by adding or subtracting from 2026:

- 1st neighbor: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- 2nd neighbor: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- 3rd neighbor: 2026 - 144 = 1882
- 4th neighbor: 2026 + 144 = 2170
- 5th neighbor: 2026 - 145 = 1881
- 6th neighbor: 2026 + 145 = 2171

Now we can sum these neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 1882 + 2170 + 1881 + 2171 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid is 12156.
