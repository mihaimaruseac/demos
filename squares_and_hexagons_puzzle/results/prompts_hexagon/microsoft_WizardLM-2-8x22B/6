To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral. The hexagonal grid can be thought of as a combination of overlapping upward and downward triangles, where each number is the sum of the three numbers above it (in the case of a downward triangle) or below it (in the case of an upward triangle).

The natural numbers are written in a spiral starting from 1 at the center and moving outward in a counterclockwise direction. The pattern of movement is: right, up, left, down, left, up, right, down, and then it repeats. Each move takes us to an adjacent cell on the hexagonal grid.

To find the position of 2026, we need to determine how many full cycles of the spiral pattern have been completed before reaching 2026 and then figure out where 2026 falls within the current cycle.

The first step is to calculate the number of complete cycles. Each cycle consists of 6 moves (right, up, left, down, left, up), and the sequence of numbers within each cycle is an arithmetic progression starting from 1. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:

Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

We need to find the largest n such that the sum is less than or equal to 2026. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for n:

n^2 + n - 2 * 2026 <= 0

Solving this inequality, we find the largest integer n that satisfies it. Once we have n, we subtract the sum of the first n natural numbers from 2026 to find the position of 2026 within its cycle.

Let's calculate n:

n^2 + n - 4052 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

n = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 + 4 * 4052)) / 2
n = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 + 16208)) / 2
n = (-1 +/- sqrt(16209)) / 2
n = (-1 + 127.3) / 2
n = 126.3 / 2
n ≈ 63.15

Since n must be an integer, we take n = 63. This means that 2026 is in the 64th cycle (since we start counting from 0).

Now we calculate the sum of the first 63 natural numbers:

Sum = 63 * (63 + 1) / 2
Sum = 63 * 64 / 2
Sum = 2016

So, 2026 is the 10th number in the 64th cycle, as 2026 - 2016 = 10.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are the numbers immediately before and after it in the spiral. Since the spiral is moving counterclockwise, the neighbors are:

- The number to the right of 2026 (2026 + 1)
- The number above and to the right of 2026 (2026 + 7) because we move up 6 positions in the spiral (since each side of the hexagon has 6 numbers in this cycle)
- The number above and to the left of 2026 (2026 + 12) because we move up 6 and then left 6 positions
- The number to the left of 2026 (2026 + 13) because we move left 6 positions and then up 1 position (since we are moving up the spiral)
- The number below and to the left of 2026 (2026 - 5) because we move left 6 and then down 1 position
- The number below and to the right of 2026 (2026 - 11) because we move down 6 positions and then right 6 positions (since each side of the hexagon has 6 numbers in this cycle)

Now we can calculate the sum of the neighbors:

Neighbor sum = (2026 + 1) + (2026 + 7) + (2026 + 12) + (2026 + 13) + (2026 - 5) + (2026 - 11)
Neighbor sum = 6 * 2026 + 1 + 7 + 12 + 13 - 5 - 11
Neighbor sum = 12156 + 27
Neighbor sum = 12183

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 12183.
