To find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the grid. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, one in each of the six directions: up, upper-right, lower-right, down, lower-left, and upper-left.

The hexagonal grid can be thought of as a series of interleaved vertical and horizontal lines, with the vertical lines containing numbers in sequence going upwards, and the horizontal lines containing numbers in sequence going from left to right.

To find the position of 2026, we can imagine laying out the numbers in a spiral starting from 1 at the center and moving outwards in a counterclockwise direction. The first few numbers would look like this:

```
    6--11--10-- 5
    |   |   |   |
    7--12--17--16-- 4
    |   |   |   |
    8--13--18--19--14
    |   |   |   |
    9--14--15-- 3
    |   |   |   |
    1-- 2--15--14-- 4
    |   |   |   |
   20--21--22-- ...
```

The pattern repeats every six numbers in a hexagonal shape. Since 2026 is much larger than 6, we can find its position by taking the remainder of 2026 divided by 6 to determine its position within the hexagonal pattern.

2026 % 6 = 2

This means that 2026 is in the second position of the hexagonal pattern. Since the pattern starts with 1 at the center, the second position is directly to the right of the center. This is the top-right corner of the central hexagon.

Now, let's find the numbers that are direct neighbors to 2026:

1. Directly below 2026: 2026 - 6 = 2020
2. Directly above 2026: 2026 + 6 = 2032
3. To the left of 2026: 2026 - 1 = 2025
4. To the right of 2026: 2026 + 1 = 2027
5. Below and to the left: 2020 - 1 = 2019
6. Above and to the right: 2032 + 1 = 2033

Now we sum these six numbers to find the answer:

2020 + 2032 + 2025 + 2027 + 2019 + 2033 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 12156.
