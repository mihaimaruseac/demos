To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the grid. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has up to six neighbors: one above, one below, two to the sides, and two on the diagonals (which are also adjacent due to the hexagonal nature of the grid).

The pattern of numbers on the hexagonal grid can be visualized by starting from the center and spiraling outwards in an increasingly large hexagonal pattern. The key to finding the neighbors of a given number is to determine its position in the spiral and then identify the numbers that are directly adjacent to it.

Let's first determine the position of 2026 in the spiral. We can do this by counting outwards from the center, adding one layer of the spiral at a time. The center is number 1, and each new layer consists of a hexagon with an increasing number of sides. The numbers increase by 1 as we move around the spiral.

To find the layer in which 2026 lies, we can simulate the process of filling out the spiral until we reach that number. We know that the first layer has 1 number, the second layer has 6 numbers, the third layer has 12 numbers, and so on. The number of cells added with each new layer is 6 times the layer number (since there are 6 sides to the hexagon).

Let's calculate the layer that contains 2026:

1st layer: 1 cell (1)
2nd layer: 6 cells (2 to 7)
3rd layer: 12 cells (8 to 19)
...
nth layer: 6 * (n - 1) cells

We need to find n such that:

1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6 * (n - 1) < 2026 <= 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6 * n

This is the sum of an arithmetic series, and the sum of the first n-1 terms is:

S = n * (n - 1) / 2

So we have:

n * (n - 1) / 2 < 2026 <= n * (n + 1) / 2

We can solve for n by trial and error or by using a formula for solving quadratic inequalities. Let's use trial and error for simplicity:

For n = 23, we have:
23 * 22 / 2 = 253 < 2026

For n = 24, we have:
24 * 23 / 2 = 276 > 2026

So 2026 is in the 23rd layer. Now we need to find its position within that layer. The 23rd layer has 23 * 6 = 138 cells. Since 2026 is less than 253 (the first number of the 24th layer), it must be one of the numbers in the 23rd layer.

To find the exact position of 2026 within the 23rd layer, we subtract the sum of the first 22 layers from 2026:

2026 - (1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 138) = 2026 - (23 * 22) / 2 = 2026 - 253 = 1773

So 2026 is the 1773rd number in the spiral. However, we made a mistake in our calculation. We should have subtracted the sum of the numbers in the 22nd layer from 2026 directly:

2026 - 138 = 1888

Now we need to determine the position of 1888 within the 23rd layer. The 23rd layer is a hexagon with sides of length 23. The numbers increase by 1 as we move around the spiral, so we can find the position of 1888 by imagining the path of the spiral:

- The top side of the hexagon will have numbers 139 to 160 (23 numbers).
- The top-right side will have numbers 161 to 182 (23 numbers).
- The bottom-right side will have numbers 183 to 204 (23 numbers).
- The bottom side will have numbers 205 to 226 (23 numbers).
- The bottom-left side will have numbers 227 to 248 (23 numbers).
- The top-left side will have numbers 249 to 270 (23 numbers).

Since 1888 is greater than 182 and less than 204, it is on the bottom-right side of the hexagon. To find its exact spot, we subtract 182 from 1888:

1888 - 182 = 66

This means 1888 is 66 numbers away from the start of the bottom-right side. Since the bottom-right side has 23 numbers, 1888 is the 66th number, which is 43 numbers away from the corner of the hexagon (since 23 - 66 = -43).

The neighbors of 1888 (and thus 2026, which is the same position within its layer) are:
- The number directly above: 1888 - 23 = 1865
- The number directly below: 1888 + 23 = 1911
- The numbers to the left and right: 1888 - 1 = 1887 and 1888 + 1 = 1889
- The numbers on the diagonals: 1888 - 24 = 1864 and 1888 + 24 = 1912

Now we can sum the neighbors:

1865 + 1911 + 1887 + 1889 + 1864 + 1912 = 11447

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 11447.
