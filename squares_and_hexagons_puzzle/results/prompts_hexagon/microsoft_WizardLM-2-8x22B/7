To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to visualize how the numbers are laid out. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has up to six neighbors, one in each of the six cardinal directions: north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and northwest.

To find the position of 2026, we first need to determine how the numbers are spiraling. The grid starts at the center with 1, and each new layer of the spiral adds more numbers in a hexagonal pattern. The first layer has 1 (the center), the second layer has 6 numbers (2 through 7), the third layer has 12 numbers (8 through 19), and so on.

To find the layer that 2026 is on, we can calculate the number of layers by finding the largest hexagonal number less than or equal to 2026. A hexagonal number for layer n is given by the formula:

H(n) = n * (2n - 1)

We want to find the largest n such that H(n) ≤ 2026. We can solve this by trial and error or by using an equation solver.

Let's use trial and error:
- H(1) = 1 * (2 * 1 - 1) = 1
- H(2) = 2 * (2 * 2 - 1) = 6
- H(3) = 3 * (2 * 3 - 1) = 18
- ...
- H(19) = 19 * (2 * 19 - 1) = 722
- H(20) = 20 * (2 * 20 - 1) = 861

We see that 2026 is between H(19) and H(20). This means 2026 is on the 20th layer of the hexagonal grid.

Now, we need to find where on this layer 2026 falls. The 20th layer starts at H(19) + 1 = 723 and ends at H(20) = 861. There are 861 - 723 + 1 = 139 numbers on the 20th layer.

The numbers on the 20th layer form a hexagon with six sides. Each side of the hexagon has 20 numbers, but we need to account for the corners, which are shared by two sides. There are 6 corners, so we have:

Total numbers on one side = 20
Total numbers on all six sides = 6 * 20 = 120
Numbers on corners = 6 (shared by two sides each)
Numbers on the middles of the sides = 120 - 6 = 114

Each side of the hexagon has 20 - 1 = 19 numbers that are not corners. Since there are 6 sides, we have 19 * 6 = 114 middle numbers. The 2026th number will be one of these middle numbers because the corners and the first and last numbers on each side are not middle numbers.

To find the exact position of 2026 on its side of the hexagon, we calculate its position within the 20th layer:

Position of 2026 within the layer = 2026 - (H(19) + 1) = 2026 - 723 = 1303

Since there are 114 middle numbers and they are symmetrically distributed on the six sides, each side will have 114 / 6 ≈ 19 middle numbers. To find which side 2026 is on, we divide its position within the layer by the number of middle numbers per side:

Side number = 1303 % 19 = 14 (since 1303 / 19 = 68 with a remainder of 14)

This means 2026 is on the 15th position of the 16th side (since we start counting from 0). The sides are numbered starting from the top side and moving clockwise. The top side corresponds to the north direction in the hexagonal grid.

Now we can find the neighbors:

- North neighbor: 2026 - 20
- Northeast neighbor: 2026 - 20 + 1
- Southeast neighbor: 2026 + 1
- South neighbor: 2026 + 20
- Southwest neighbor: 2026 + 20 - 1
- Northwest neighbor: 2026 - 1

Let's calculate these:

- North neighbor: 2026 - 20 = 2006
- Northeast neighbor: 2026 - 20 + 1 = 2007
- Southeast neighbor: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- South neighbor: 2026 + 20 = 2046
- Southwest neighbor: 2026 + 20 - 1 = 2045
- Northwest neighbor: 2026 - 1 = 2025

Now we sum these numbers:

2006 + 2007 + 2027 + 2046 + 2045 + 2025 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid is 12156.
