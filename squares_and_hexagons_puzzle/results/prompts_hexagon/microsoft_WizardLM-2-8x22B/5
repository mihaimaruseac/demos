To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to understand the pattern of the grid. In a hexagonal grid, each cell (except for those on the edges) has six neighbors: one above, one below, two to the sides, and two diagonally adjacent (one in the direction of the spiral and one against it).

The spiral pattern is as follows: it starts at the center with 1, and each shell of the spiral contains consecutive natural numbers. The first shell is just the number 1, the second shell contains 2 and 3, the third shell contains 4 to 9, and so on. Each new shell contains six more numbers than the previous one.

To find which shell the number 2026 is in, we can calculate the number of cells in each complete shell (including the center) and then determine how many full shells there are up to 2026. A complete shell contains 6 times the number of sides of the hexagon, which is 6. So, the nth shell contains 6n cells.

Let's find the shell number for 2026:

1 + 6(1) = 7 cells for the first shell
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) = 19 cells for the second shell
...

We can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n + 1)/2, to find the total number of cells up to the nth shell:

Total cells up to nth shell = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 + ... + n)
                             = 1 + 6 * n(n + 1)/2

We want to find the smallest n such that 2026 is less than or equal to the total number of cells up to the nth shell:

2026 ≤ 1 + 6 * n(n + 1)/2

Solving for n, we get:

2025 ≤ 3 * n(n + 1)

We can solve this quadratic inequality by expressing it as:

n^2 + n - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4 * 1 * (-675))]/(2 * 1)
n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)]/2
n = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

Since n must be positive, we take the positive root:

n ≈ [-1 + 52]/2
n ≈ 25.5

Since n must be an integer, we take the next smallest integer, which is 25. This means that 2026 is in the 26th shell.

Now, within its shell, 2026 is the last number, so its neighbors are the last six numbers before it. In a hexagonal grid, these neighbors are directly above, to the left, to the right, and the three adjacent numbers along the diagonal directions.

The six neighbors of 2026 are:

- Directly above: 2026 - (number of sides of the hexagon) = 2026 - 6 = 2020
- Directly to the right: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- Directly to the left: 2026 - 2 = 2024 (since moving to the left is equivalent to decreasing by 2 in this pattern)
- Diagonally up and to the right: 2026 - 1 - (number of sides of the hexagon - 1) = 2026 - 6 = 2020
- Diagonally up and to the left: 2026 - 2 - (number of sides of the hexagon - 2) = 2026 - 6 = 2020
- Diagonally down and to the left: 2026 - (number of sides of the hexagon) - 2 = 2026 - 8 = 2018

Now we sum these neighbors:

2020 + 2025 + 2024 + 2020 + 2020 + 2018 = 12097

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12097.
