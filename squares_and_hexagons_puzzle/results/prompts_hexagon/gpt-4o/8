To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, we first need to determine where 2026 is located within the grid.

The hexagonal grid is composed of concentric hexagons. The center has the number 1. The numbers following 1 grow outward in layers. The number of numbers on each layer forms a hexagonal pattern.

The numbers at the corners of each hexagonal layer k are given by these formulas:
- Bottom-right: \(3k^2 - 3k + 2\)
- Bottom: \(3k^2 - 2k + 2\)
- Bottom-left: \(3k^2 - k + 2\)
- Top-left: \(3k^2 + 1\)
- Top: \(3k^2 + k + 1\)
- Top-right: \(3k^2 + 2k + 1\)

Hence, the last number in a hexagon layer k is: \(n = 1 + 3k(k - 1)\).

First, identify the corresponding hexagonal layer of 2026.
- For k=0 (center), it’s [1]
- For k=1, total is 1 + 3(1)(0) = 4
   - 1, [2-4] (Count is 4 numbers)
- For k=2, total is 1 + 3(2)(1) = 10
   - 1, [2-4], [5-10] (Count is 10)
- For k=3, total is 1 + 3(3)(2) = 19
   - 1, [2-4], [5-10], [11-19] (Counts are 19 numbers)
- For k=4, total is 1 + 3(4)(3) = 37
   - 1, [2-4], [5-10], [11-19], [20-37] (Counts are 37 numbers)
.
.
- For k = 26, total is 1 + 3(26)(25) = 1951
- For k = 27, total is 1 + 3(27)(26) = 2107 

Therefore, 2026 is on layer 27, as it is more than 1951 but less than 2108.

We then calculate the location of 2026. The numbers start on the bottom-right corner step-wise counter-clockwise for each layer after the first one. Each side of the hexagon has 27 numbers in layer 27. The position on layer:
- First number, start with \(1952 = 3 \times 26^2 + 1 + 1\)
- Address number 2026: 2026 - 1952 = 74 away from the corner

The count 74 exceeds the length of one edge (27), which means we need to find the exact positional edge. 
- For all of first edge (BR - B) is within \(1953 + 26 = 1979\)
- For all of second edge (B - BL) is within \(1980 + 26 = 2006\)
- For partway third edge (BL - TL):
   - \(2007, 2008 ...\) while counting 20 in \(2006 + 7 = 2013\)
   - Correctly into the third edge, at positional number \(2026 - (2006)= 20\)

Neighbors roll over:
- Before: \(2026-1: 2025\) (leftwards)
- Skip back to Next Corner = TL: look at two-layer full next(hexagonal math - BL corner) also 
- Add raw current TW , then preceding hexagonal start @move
- Subsequent skip shell circle CW:
   - 2026's next two numbers [1951] then return in hexagon [2013] and main sequence
 
By identified sequence and numbered layers, it concludes across:
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
& & 1951 & 2025 & \\
& 2013 & 2026 & 2006 & 2010 \\
1950 & 1954 & 1973 & & 
\end{array}
\]

They're irregular spiral line, final match neighbors of 2026:
 - Top-right, Top, Top-left, Bottom-left, Bottom, Bottom-right

Thus numbers by above 2024-ex (extra noting, hex spiral alter_neighbor pattern) repeated in total possess:
\[2025, 2048, 2013, 1951, 1954, 2010\]

The total for these neighbors is: \( 2025 + 1951 + 2013 + 1954 + 2010 + 2048 = 12,001\).
