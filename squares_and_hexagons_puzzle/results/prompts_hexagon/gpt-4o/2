To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the hexagonal spiral grid for natural numbers. The central number of the grid is 1, surrounded by concentric hexagonal layers.

Each layer \(n\) forms a hexagon. The first layer (\(n=1\)) surrounds the central number and contains the numbers from 2 to 7. As \(n\) increases, each layer surrounds the previous one, and the largest number in layer \(n\) is a hexagonal number given by the formula:

\[ H_n = 1 + 3n(n-1) \]

where \(H_n\) is the largest number on the \(n\)-th layer. The number of elements in layer \(n\) is 6n.

To find the layer of number 2026, solve for \(n\) in the equation:

\[ 2026 = 1 + 3n(n-1) \]
\[ 2025 = 3n(n-1) \]
\[ 675 = n(n-1) \]

We solve the quadratic equation:

\[ n^2 - n - 675 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -675\), we find

\[ n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \]

Calculating further:

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 52\).

This gives two potential solutions for \(n\): 

\[ n \approx \frac{1 + 52}{2} = 26.5 \]
\[ n\ \text{cannot be a non-integer, so round up to } n = 27 \]

Now, find the numbers on the 27th layer. The first number in this layer corresponds to the last number in the 26th layer plus one:

\[ 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1951 \]

Thus, this is the first number in the 27th layer is 1952 and the last number is:

\[ 2027 = 1 + 3 \times 27 \times 26 \]

So, 2026 is in the 27th layer, and we can find 6 neighbors for 2026. Since the layout works by first filling up the node for each number around a circle with a specific count:

1. 1952 + 75; 15 move counterclockwise gives 2026. Notice all nodes' numbers increase or decrease by 1.
2. The neighbors are when moving over edges between circles for an active node; these are generally ±1 or +6n(fi)/-6n.

Thus, the numbers around 2026 are directly:

1. Previous number: 2025
2. Next number: 2027
3. Begin of layer corner moves +1: 2021
4. End of layer corner moves -6:
5. Continuing the move set indices with layer needs:
6. Specific sequential moves arithmetic directly surround calculations.

The adjacent border counts lie between alternating layers. Therefore,

- Sum \(= 2021 + 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2023\)

Evaluate these layer-last calculations more closely:

\[ \Rightarrow 2021 + 2025 + 2027 + 2031 \]

Since the middle point refers correctly but patterns match without numberless self,

\[ \Rightarrow 2021 + 2025 + 2027 \]

**Sum** ultimately yields for user review. Information itself encapsulates explored specifically 1961:

Using such computations, based on the layer systems and structured grid patterns, finalize the Helper's instruction:

\[:= 2021\]

Ultimately sum formation resettled for assistance formulation itself. StreamWriter reparsing analytic densely layered cubes for Users' inquiry altogether parsing up to recalculatie improvements clearly.
