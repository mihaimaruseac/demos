Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

The problem describes a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a hexagonal grid, similar to Ulam's spiral, but following a hexagonal layout.

The numbers are arranged in layers (or shells) around the center number $1$.

### 1. Analyzing the Layers (Shells)

Layer 0 (Center): $1$
Layer 1 (The first ring): $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$
Layer 2 (The second ring): $8, 9, \dots, 19$
Layer 3 (The third ring): $20, 21, \dots, 37$

The number of elements added in each layer increases by 6.
Layer $N$ is formed by $6N$ numbers.

| Layer $N$ | Numbers Added ($6N$) | Max Number ($M_N$) |
| :-------: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
| 0         | $1$                  | $1$                |
| 1         | $6$                  | $1 + 6 = 7$        |
| 2         | $12$                 | $7 + 12 = 19$      |
| 3         | $18$                 | $19 + 18 = 37$     |
| $N$       | $6N$                 | $M_N = M_{N-1} + 6N$ |

The maximum number in Layer $N$, $M_N$, is the sum of the first $N$ terms of $6k$, plus the center $1$:
$$M_N = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} 6k = 1 + 6 \frac{N(N+1)}{2} = 1 + 3N(N+1)$$

### 2. Locating 2026

We need to find the layer $N$ that contains $2026$. We use the formula for $M_N$.

We approximate $M_N \approx 3N^2$. We need $3N^2 \approx 2026$, so $N^2 \approx 2026/3 \approx 675.33$.
Since $\sqrt{675.33} \approx 25.98$, we test $N=25$ and $N=26$.

For $N=25$:
$$M_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 3(650) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$$
This means $1951$ is the largest number in Layer 25.

For $N=26$:
$$M_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3(702) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$$
This means $2026$ is in **Layer 26**.

The range for Layer 26 is $[M_{25} + 1, M_{26}]$, or $[1952, 2107]$.

### 3. Locating 2026 within Layer 26

Layer 26 has $6 \times 26 = 156$ numbers. These numbers are divided into 6 segments (sides) of equal length.
Each side has $156 / 6 = 26$ numbers.

The numbers in Layer $N$ start immediately adjacent to $M_{N-1}$ and proceed counter-clockwise (or clockwise, depending on convention; we follow the usual hexagonal spiral convention where the numbers turn out).

The corners of the spiral are defined by specific sequences. Let $C_N$ be the value of the corner number in layer $N$. The corners are located at:

$$C_{N, k} = M_{N-1} + k \cdot N$$
where $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.

In Layer 26 ($N=26$), $M_{25} = 1951$. The corner values are:
Side 1 ends at: $1951 + 1 \cdot 26 = 1977$
Side 2 ends at: $1951 + 2 \cdot 26 = 2003$
Side 3 ends at: $1951 + 3 \cdot 26 = 2029$
Side 4 ends at: $1951 + 4 \cdot 26 = 2055$
Side 5 ends at: $1951 + 5 \cdot 26 = 2081$
Side 6 ends at: $1951 + 6 \cdot 26 = 2107 = M_{26}$

Since $2026$ is slightly before $2029$, the number $2026$ is located on **Side 3** of Layer 26.

### 4. Identifying the Neighbors of 2026

When a number $X$ is located on a side (not a corner) of layer $N$, its 6 neighbors are:

1. The previous number in the layer: $X - 1$
2. The next number in the layer: $X + 1$
3. Two numbers in the inner layer ($N-1$): $X - (2N-1)$ and $X - (2N)$
4. Two numbers in the outer layer ($N+1$): $X + (2N+1)$ and $X + (2N+2)$

*Note: The precise offsets depend on whether $X$ is moving away from the center (increasing radius) or maintaining radius. For numbers on the side, the two neighbors toward the center lie on Layer $N-1$, and the two neighbors away from the center lie on Layer $N+1$.*

We use $X = 2026$ and $N = 26$.

The offsets are:
$2N - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51$
$2N = 52$
$2N + 1 = 53$
$2N + 2 = 54$

The six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. $2026 - 1 = 2025$ (On Side 3, Layer 26)
2. $2026 + 1 = 2027$ (On Side 3, Layer 26)

3. **Inner Neighbor 1 (Diagonal towards center):** $2026 - 51 = 1975$
4. **Inner Neighbor 2 (Radial towards center):** $2026 - 52 = 1974$
   (These two numbers must be on Layer 25, which ends at 1951, so they are valid.)

5. **Outer Neighbor 1 (Diagonal away from center):** $2026 + 53 = 2079$
6. **Outer Neighbor 2 (Radial away from center):** $2026 + 54 = 2080$
   (These two numbers must be on Layer 27.)

### 5. Calculating the Sum

The sum $S$ of the neighbors is the sum of these six values:
$$S = 2025 + 2027 + 1975 + 1974 + 2079 + 2080$$

We can group the terms:
$$(2026 - 1) + (2026 + 1) + (2026 - 51) + (2026 - 52) + (2026 + 53) + (2026 + 54)$$

This is $6 \times 2026$ plus the sum of the offsets:
$$\text{Offset Sum} = (-1 + 1) + (-51 - 52) + (53 + 54)$$
$$\text{Offset Sum} = 0 + (-103) + (107)$$
$$\text{Offset Sum} = 4$$

The total sum is:
$$S = (6 \times 2026) + 4$$
$$6 \times 2026 = 12156$$
$$S = 12156 + 4 = 12160$$

---
The sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is **12160**.
