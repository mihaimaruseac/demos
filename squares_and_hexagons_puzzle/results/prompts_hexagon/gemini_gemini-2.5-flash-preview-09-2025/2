The problem asks for the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number $N=2026$ in a hexagonal spiral grid.

### 1. Finding the Ring (Radius $k$)

The numbers in a hexagonal spiral are arranged in rings $R_k$, starting with $R_1$ (numbers 2 to 7). The number of cells in ring $R_k$ is $6k$.
Let $N_k$ be the starting number of ring $R_k$.
$N_k = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1)$.

We estimate $k$ such that $3k(k-1) \approx 2026$. $k^2 \approx 675$. $k \approx 26$.
For $k=26$:
$N_{26} = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
The ring $R_{26}$ starts at 1951.
$N_{27} = N_{26} + 6 \cdot 26 = 1951 + 156 = 2107$.
Since $1951 \le 2026 < 2107$, $N=2026$ lies in Ring $R_{26}$. $k=26$.

### 2. Finding the Position within the Ring

$R_{26}$ has $6k = 156$ steps, divided into 6 segments of length $k=26$ steps each (27 numbers per segment, counting the vertices shared between segments).
The offset $M$ from the start of the ring is $M = N - N_k = 2026 - 1951 = 75$.

The segments S1, S2, ..., S6 correspond to $M$ ranges:
S1: $M=0$ to 26 (27 numbers).
S2: $M=26$ to 52.
S3: $M=52$ to 78.

Since $52 \le M=75 \le 78$, the number 2026 lies in Segment 3 (S3).
$m=2$ (index 0, 1, 2 for S1, S2, S3).
$j = M - 52 = 75 - 52 = 23$.

Since $0 < j=23 < k=26$, 2026 is an internal point within Segment 3 (S3) and not a corner vertex.

### 3. Identifying the Neighbors

An internal point $N$ in ring $R_k$ has 6 neighbors:
1. $N-1$ and $N+1$ (on the same ring $R_k$).
2. Two neighbors in the inner ring $R_{k-1}$ (here $R_{25}$).
3. Two neighbors in the outer ring $R_{k+1}$ (here $R_{27}$).

$N=2026$.
Neighbors on $R_{26}$: $N_{Rk, 1} = 2025$, $N_{Rk, 2} = 2027$.
Sum: $2025 + 2027 = 4052$.

We use the established relationships for neighbors of internal points in hexagonal spirals. If $N$ is located $j$ steps into segment $m$:
$N_{in, 1} = N - (6(k-1) + \Delta_1)$
$N_{in, 2} = N - (6(k-1) + \Delta_2)$
$N_{out, 1} = N + (6k + \Delta_3)$
$N_{out, 2} = N + (6k + \Delta_4)$

For $k=26$: $6(k-1) = 6(25) = 150$. $6k = 156$.

When $N$ is on a segment (not a vertex), the differences $\{\Delta_1, \Delta_2\}$ usually result in $6(k-1) + 2$ and $6(k-1) + 3$, and $\{\Delta_3, \Delta_4\}$ result in $6k + 2$ and $6k + 3$. The precise assignment depends on the side index $m$.

We previously determined the specific neighbors for $N=2026$ ($k=26, m=2, j=23$):

Neighbors on $R_{25}$ ($k'=25$):
$N_{25} = 1801$. $N_{in, 1} = 1873$. $N_{in, 2} = 1874$.
Differences: $2026 - 1873 = 153$. $2026 - 1874 = 152$.
$153 = 150 + 3$. $152 = 150 + 2$.
Sum: $1873 + 1874 = 3747$.

Neighbors on $R_{27}$ ($k''=27$):
$N_{27} = 2107$. $N_{out, 1} = 2185$. $N_{out, 2} = 2184$.
Differences: $2185 - 2026 = 159$. $2184 - 2026 = 158$.
$159 = 156 + 3$. $158 = 156 + 2$.
Sum: $2185 + 2184 = 4369$.

### 4. Calculating the Total Sum

The sum of all 6 neighbors is:
$$S = (2025 + 2027) + (1873 + 1874) + (2185 + 2184)$$
$$S = 4052 + 3747 + 4369$$
$$S = 7799 + 4369 = 12168$$

Alternatively, using the general formula for internal points $N$:
$S = 6N + 2(6) = 6N + 12$.
$S = 6(2026) + 12 = 12156 + 12 = 12168$.
