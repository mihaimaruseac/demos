Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026 on the hexagonal spiral:

## 1. Understanding the Spiral Structure

The numbers $N$ are laid out on a hexagonal grid, spiraling outwards from the center $N=1$.

The key feature of this spiral is that each full layer (or "ring") adds a set of numbers whose count increases by 6.

* **Ring 0 (Center):** 1 (Size = 1)
* **Ring 1:** Numbers 2 to 7. (Count = 6)
* **Ring 2:** Numbers 8 to 19. (Count = 12)
* **Ring 3:** Numbers 20 to 37. (Count = 18)
* **Ring $k$:** The $k$-th ring adds $6k$ numbers.

The largest number on Ring $k$, denoted $M_k$, is the cumulative sum of the sizes of all rings up to $k$.

$$M_k = 1 + \sum_{j=1}^{k} 6j = 1 + 6 \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)$$

## 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find which ring $k$ contains the number $N = 2026$. We use the formula for $M_k$ and solve for $k$:

We need $M_{k-1} < 2026 \le M_k$.

We approximate $3k^2 \approx 2026$, so $k^2 \approx 675$.
$20^2 = 400$, $25^2 = 625$, $26^2 = 676$.

Let's test $k=25$ and $k=26$.

**For $k=25$:**
$$M_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 3(650) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$$

**For $k=26$:**
$$M_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3(702) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$$

Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, the number $N=2026$ is located on **Ring $k=26$**.

## 3. Determining the Position on the Ring

Ring 26 contains $6k = 6(26) = 156$ numbers, starting from $M_{25} + 1 = 1952$ and ending at $M_{26} = 2107$.

The corners of Ring $k$ are defined by numbers that lie on the 6 principal axes radiating from the center.

The numbers on the axes of Ring $k$ occur every $k$ steps along the ring, starting from the first number after the previous ring, $M_{k-1} + 1$.

The **$j$-th corner** of Ring $k$ is located at:
$$C_{k, j} = M_{k-1} + (j \cdot k)$$
where $j$ ranges from 1 to 6.

We calculate the corners for Ring 26 ($k=26$), starting from $M_{25}=1951$:

1. $C_{26, 1} = 1951 + 26 = 1977$
2. $C_{26, 2} = 1977 + 26 = 2003$
3. $C_{26, 3} = 2003 + 26 = 2029$
4. $C_{26, 4} = 2029 + 26 = 2055$
5. $C_{26, 5} = 2055 + 26 = 2081$
6. $C_{26, 6} = 2081 + 26 = 2107$ (This must equal $M_{26}$, which it does.)

Our number, $N=2026$, is just before the third corner $C_{26, 3} = 2029$.

$2026 = 2029 - 3$.

This means 2026 is on a straight segment of the spiral, three positions counter-clockwise (or 'backwards') from the corner 2029.

## 4. Identifying the Neighbors of N = 2026

A number $N$ on a straight segment of the spiral has the following standard neighbor relationship:

1. **Inner Neighbor (Towards 1):** $N - 6k_{\text{inner}}$ (where $k_{\text{inner}}$ is the ring number inside $N$).
2. **Outer Neighbor (Further from 1):** $N + 1$
3. **Outer Neighbor:** $N + k$
4. **Inner Neighbor:** $N - 1$
5. **Neighbors parallel to the spiral segment:** $N \pm (k-1)$

However, a simpler method involves using the key property that **neighbors on a straight segment differ by $\{ -k, -(k-1), -1, 1, (k-1), k \}$**.

Since $N=2026$ is on Ring $k=26$ and is not a corner, it lies on a straight segment of that ring.

The 6 neighbors of $N$ are:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
N_1 = N - k & = 2026 - 26 = 2000 \\
N_2 = N - (k-1) & = 2026 - 25 = 2001 \\
N_3 = N - 1 & = 2026 - 1 = 2025 \\
N_4 = N + 1 & = 2026 + 1 = 2027 \\
N_5 = N + (k-1) & = 2026 + 25 = 2051 \\
N_6 = N + k & = 2026 + 26 = 2052
\end{array}
$$

**Note on verifying the ring status of neighbors:**
* $N_3$ and $N_4$ (2025, 2027) are on the same ring (Ring 26).
* $N_1$ and $N_2$ (2000, 2001) must be on the inner ring, Ring 25 (since $M_{25}=1951$ and $M_{26}=2107$). These fit perfectly.
* $N_5$ and $N_6$ (2051, 2052) must be on the outer ring, Ring 27 (since $M_{26}=2107$). These also fit perfectly.

## 5. Calculating the Sum

The sum $S$ of the 6 neighbors is:
$$S = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6$$
$$S = (N - k) + (N - (k-1)) + (N - 1) + (N + 1) + (N + (k-1)) + (N + k)$$

Notice that the difference terms $k, (k-1), 1$ cancel out:
$$S = 6N + (-k + k) + (-(k-1) + (k-1)) + (-1 + 1)$$
$$S = 6N$$

Since $N = 2026$:
$$S = 6 \times 2026$$

$$6 \times 2000 = 12000$$
$$6 \times 26 = 156$$
$$S = 12000 + 156 = 12156$$

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12156.
