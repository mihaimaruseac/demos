The natural number $N=2026$ lies on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid. We first need to determine the ring $R$ to which 2026 belongs.

The total number of cells up to Ring $R$ is $S_R = 1 + 3R(R+1)$.
We find that $S_{25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
$S_{26} = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, $N=2026$ belongs to Ring $R=26$.

Ring 26 has $6R = 6(26) = 156$ cells, running from 1952 to 2107. The ring is divided into 6 sides, each of length $L=R=26$.
The corners $V_R(j)$ (where the direction of the spiral turns) occur at $S_{R-1} + jR$.
$R=26$.
$V_{26}(1) = 1951 + 26 = 1977$.
$V_{26}(2) = 1977 + 26 = 2003$.
$V_{26}(3) = 2003 + 26 = 2029$.
$V_{26}(4) = 2055$.
...

$N=2026$ is located on Side 3, which runs from $V_{26}(2) + 1 = 2004$ to $V_{26}(3) = 2029$.
$2029 - 2026 = 3$. 2026 is 3 steps before the corner $V_{26}(3)$.

We use cube coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where $x+y+z=0$ to locate $N$. The distance from the center is $R = \max(|x|, |y|, |z|)$.
The six corner directions are $D_E, D_{NE}, D_N, D_W, D_{SW}, D_S$.
We established that $V_R(3)$ corresponds to the North axis corner, $C(V_R(3)) = (0, R, -R)$.
$C(2029) = (0, 26, -26)$.

Side 3 runs in the West direction $D_W = (-1, 1, 0)$.
The position of $N=2026$ is 3 steps back from $C(2029)$:
$C(2026) = C(2029) - 3 D_W = (0, 26, -26) - 3(-1, 1, 0) = (3, 23, -26)$.

The 6 neighbors $N$ of $C=(3, 23, -26)$ are found by adding the 6 unit direction vectors $D$.

1. Neighbors in Ring 26 (along the spiral path, $D_W$ direction):
   $N_{prev} = 2025$. $C(2025) = C + D_E = (4, 22, -26)$. (3, 23, -26) is W of (4, 22, -26).
   $N_{next} = 2027$. $C(2027) = C + D_W = (2, 24, -26)$. (3, 23, -26) is E of (2, 24, -26).

2. Neighbors in Ring 27 ($R+1=27$):
   $N_{R+1}$ cells lie in the directions $D_{NE}$ and $D_N$, as $C(2026)$ is near the N corner.
   $C_{N} = C + D_N = (3, 24, -27)$. $d=27$.
   $C_{NE} = C + D_{NE} = (4, 23, -27)$. $d=27$.

   $V_{27}(3) = (0, 27, -27)$. $N_{N}$ is 3 steps W from $V_{27}(3)$.
   $N_{N} = V_{27}(3) - 3 = 2188 - 3 = 2185$.
   $N_{NE}$ is 4 steps W from $V_{27}(3)$.
   $N_{NE} = V_{27}(3) - 4 = 2188 - 4 = 2184$.

3. Neighbors in Ring 25 ($R-1=25$):
   $N_{R-1}$ cells lie in the directions $D_{SW}$ and $D_S$.
   $C_S = C + D_S = (3, 22, -25)$. $d=25$.
   $C_{SW} = C + D_{SW} = (2, 23, -25)$. $d=25$.

   $V_{25}(3) = (0, 25, -25)$. $V_{25}(3) = S_{24} + 3(25) = 1651 + 75 = 1726$.
   $N_S$: $C_S$ is 3 steps W from $V_{25}(3)$.
   $N_S = 1726 - 3 = 1723$.
   $N_{SW}$: $C_{SW}$ is 2 steps W from $V_{25}(3)$.
   $N_{SW} = 1726 - 2 = 1724$.

The 6 neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2185, 2184, 1723, 1724.

Sum $S = 2025 + 2027 + 2185 + 2184 + 1723 + 1724$
$S = 4052 + 4369 + 3447 = 11868$.

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 11,868.
