The number $N=2026$ is written on a hexagonal spiral grid. We first need to determine the layer $K$ to which 2026 belongs.

The total number of natural numbers up to layer $K$ is $N_{max}(K) = 1 + 3K(K+1)$.

We calculate $N_{max}(K)$ for $K$ around $\sqrt{2026/3} \approx 26$:
$N_{max}(25) = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
$N_{max}(26) = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, $N=2026$ is in Layer $K=26$.

Layer 26 starts at $N_{start}(26) = 1952$. The length of this layer is $6K = 6(26) = 156$ numbers.
$N=2026$ is the $m$-th number in Layer 26, where $m = 2026 - 1952 = 74$. (Using 0-based indexing for the layer count).

Layer $K=26$ consists of 6 sides, each having $L=26$ points (corresponding to 25 steps between vertices).
Side 1: $m=0$ to $25$. (26 numbers)
Side 2: $m=26$ to $51$.
Side 3: $m=52$ to $77$.
Since $52 \le 74 \le 77$, the number 2026 is located on Side 3 ($S_3$).

We define the relative index $m_{S3} = 74 - 52 = 22$.

On the spiral path, numbers are generally surrounded by two neighbors within the same layer ($n_1, n_4$), two neighbors in the inner layer ($K-1=25$, $n_5, n_6$), and two neighbors in the outer layer ($K+1=27$, $n_2, n_3$).

1. Neighbors in Layer 26 ($N_{26}=2026$).
Since 2026 is an internal point along Side 3, its immediate neighbors along the spiral path are $n_1 = 2025$ and $n_4 = 2027$.

2. Neighbors in Layer 25 ($K=25$). $N_{max}(25)=1951$.
$N_{start}(25) = 1802$. Layer 25 has $6(25) = 150$ points.
$S_1(25)$: 1802 to 1826 (25 points, 25 segments).
$S_2(25)$: 1827 to 1851.
$S_3(25)$: 1852 to 1876.

For a point $N$ on $S_3(K)$ at relative position $m$, its Layer $K-1$ neighbors are generally located on $S_3(K-1)$.
$N=2026$ is at $m_{S3}=22$. We use coordinates analysis to confirm: $C(2026)=(3, 23, -26)$.
The Layer 25 neighbors $n_5, n_6$ are adjacent to $C(2026)$ and have coordinates distance 25. They lie on $S_3(25)$.
$S_3(25)$ runs from 1852 to 1876. These 25 numbers are $P'_0, \dots, P'_{24}$. $P'_{22}$ and $P'_{23}$ are neighbors of 2026.
$P'_{22} = 1852 + 22 = 1874$.
$P'_{23} = 1852 + 23 = 1875$.
So, $n_6 = 1874$ and $n_5 = 1875$.

3. Neighbors in Layer 27 ($K=27$). $N_{start}(27)=2108$.
Layer 27 has $6(27) = 162$ points.
$S_1(27)$: $m=0$ to $26$ (27 points). $C(2108)$ to $C(2134)$.
$S_2(27)$: $C(2135)$ to $C(2161)$.
$S_3(27)$: $C(2162)$ to $C(2188)$.

The Layer 27 neighbors $n_2, n_3$ must lie on $S_3(27)$.
$S_3(27)$ runs $P'''_0$ to $P'''_{26}$. $P'''_0 = 2162$.
$C(2026)$ is near position $m=22$ on $S_3(26)$. The neighboring cells $n_2, n_3$ in $L_{27}$ are generally at the same relative positions on $S_3(27)$.
$P'''_{22} = 2162 + 22 = 2184$.
$P'''_{23} = 2162 + 23 = 2185$.
So, $n_2 = 2184$ and $n_3 = 2185$.

The six neighbors are $\{2025, 2027, 1874, 1875, 2184, 2185\}$.

The sum $S$ is:
$S = (2025 + 2027) + (1874 + 1875) + (2184 + 2185)$
$S = 4052 + 3749 + 4369$
$S = 12170$.
