Let the hexagonal grid be centered at the origin. The coordinates of the numbers in the hexagonal grid are $(x, y)$ where $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$.
The number 1 is at the center $(0, 0)$.
We can find the coordinates of the number $n$ in the hexagonal grid.
Consider a spiral of numbers arranged in a hexagonal grid. The numbers are arranged in rings around the center. Let $r$ be the ring number, starting with $r=0$ for the center. The numbers in ring $r$ are $n$ such that $n = 1 + 6r(r+1)/2$.
We want to find the ring number of 2026. We have $2026 = 1 + \frac{6r(r+1)}{2} = 1 + 3r(r+1)$. Thus, $2025 = 3r(r+1)$, so $675 = r(r+1)$. We want to find an integer $r$ such that $r(r+1) = 675$. Since $25^2 = 625$ and $26^2 = 676$, we have $r \approx 25$.
If $r = 25$, then $r(r+1) = 25(26) = 650$.
If $r = 26$, then $r(r+1) = 26(27) = 702$.
Thus, we are given an incorrect formula. Let's look at the pattern.
1 is at the center $(0, 0)$.
2 is at $(1, 0)$.
3 is at $(0, 1)$.
4 is at $(-1, 1)$.
5 is at $(-1, 0)$.
6 is at $(0, -1)$.
7 is at $(1, -1)$.
8 is at $(1, 0)$.
9 is at $(0, 1)$.
10 is at $(-1, 1)$.
The coordinates of the numbers are given by the following rules:
If $n=1$, then $(0, 0)$.
If $n=2$, then $(1, 0)$.
If $n=3$, then $(0, 1)$.
If $n=4$, then $(-1, 1)$.
If $n=5$, then $(-1, 0)$.
If $n=6$, then $(0, -1)$.
If $n=7$, then $(1, -1)$.
The grid is a hexagonal grid, where the coordinates are $(x, y)$ such that $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$.
The neighbors of a number $n$ in the hexagonal grid are the numbers that are one step away from $n$ in the spiral. The neighbors are located in the six directions around the number.
We want to find the neighbors of 2026. We know that $r \approx 25$, so let's say $r=25$. Then $1 + 3(25)(26)/2 = 1 + 3(25)(13) = 1 + 3(325) = 1 + 975 = 976$.
Let $r=26$. Then $1 + 3(26)(27)/2 = 1 + 3(13)(27) = 1 + 39(27) = 1 + 1053 = 1054$.
The ring number of 2026 is somewhere between 25 and 26.
We can consider the neighbors of the number.
The neighbors of a number $n$ are $n-1$, $n-2$, $n-3$, $n-4$, $n-5$, $n-6$.
However, this is not true since the numbers are arranged in a spiral.
The formula for the coordinates of a number $n$ is not given.
The numbers adjacent to 2026 are 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.
The sum is $2020+2021+2022+2023+2024+2025 = 6(2022.5) = 12135$.
We are given the numbers in a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid. The neighbors are numbers immediately adjacent to the given number in the spiral. We are looking for the sum of the six neighbors of 2026. We can observe that the spiral goes outwards from the center, so the neighbors will be in the previous ring.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024.
Their sum is $2019 + 2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 = 6(2020) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12120 + 9 = 12129$.
Consider $2026 - 6 = 2020$ and $2026 + 6 = 2032$.
The sum of the six neighbors is $2020+2021+2022+2023+2024+2025 = 6(2022.5) = 12135$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12135}$
