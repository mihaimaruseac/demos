Let the hexagonal grid be denoted by coordinates $(x, y)$.
The spiral starts with 1 in the center. The number 1 is at the center of the hexagon. The numbers increase in a spiral pattern.
The numbers are arranged such that the central number is 1, the next layer is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the next layer is 7, 8, ..., 12, and so on.

The distance from the center is the number of layers.
Let $n$ be the layer we are on, so $n=0$ is the center, $n=1$ is the first layer, $n=2$ is the second layer, etc.
The number of elements in each layer is $6n$ for $n > 0$.
The maximum number in layer $n$ is $1 + 6n$.
The numbers in layer $n$ are $1+6(n-1), 1+6(n-1)+1, ..., 1+6(n-1)+6$.
The sum of the numbers in layer $n$ is $\sum_{k=1}^{6n} (1+(k-1)) = 6n + \frac{6n(6n-1)}{2} = 6n + 3n(6n-1) = 6n + 18n^2 - 3n = 18n^2 + 3n$.

Let $N=2026$. We want to find the layer $n$ containing $N$.
We have $18n^2 + 3n \approx N = 2026$.
$18n^2 + 3n - 2026 = 0$
$n = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(18)(-2026)}}{2(18)} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 145872}}{36} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{145881}}{36} \approx \frac{-3 \pm 381.98}{36}$
$n \approx \frac{378.98}{36} \approx 10.527$, so we can try $n=10$ and $n=11$.

For $n=10$, the sum is $18(10)^2 + 3(10) = 1800 + 30 = 1830$.
The largest number in layer 10 is $1 + 6(10) = 61$.
The first number in layer 11 is $61 + 1 = 62$, and the largest number is $61 + 6 = 67$.
The smallest number in layer 11 is 62.

Let's see if 2026 is in layer 10 or layer 11.
Since $1830 < 2026$, we know that 2026 is in layer 11.
The numbers in layer 11 are from 62 to 67. But $2026 > 67$.

The numbers in the spiral form layers of 6 numbers each.
Let $n$ be the layer. Then $n=1$ is layer 1.
The first number in the $k$-th layer is $1 + 6(k-1)$.
In the 11th layer, the numbers are $1 + 6(10) = 61$ to $1 + 6(10) + 5 = 66$.
The numbers in the 12th layer are $67$ to $67 + 5 = 72$.
So the numbers in the 11th layer are $61, 62, ..., 66$. The numbers in the 12th layer are $67, 68, ..., 72$.

We need to find the layer that contains 2026.
The sum of numbers in the layers up to layer $n$ is $\sum_{k=1}^n (18k^2 + 3k) = 18 \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 + 3 \sum_{k=1}^n k = 18 \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + 3 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3n(n+1)(2n+1) + \frac{3}{2} n(n+1) = n(n+1) (3(2n+1) + \frac{3}{2}) = n(n+1) (6n+3 + \frac{3}{2}) = n(n+1) (6n+\frac{9}{2})$.
Let $S(n) = n(n+1)(6n+\frac{9}{2})$.
$S(10) = 10(11)(60+\frac{9}{2}) = 110(60+4.5) = 110(64.5) = 7100-55 = 7095$.
$S(11) = 11(12)(66+\frac{9}{2}) = 132(66+4.5) = 132(70.5) = 132(70) + 132(0.5) = 9240 + 66 = 9306$.

Since the hexagonal grid has 6 neighbors, let $N$ be the number.
We have $N=2026$. We want to find the 6 neighbors of $N$.
We cannot determine the 6 neighbors.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{4052}$
