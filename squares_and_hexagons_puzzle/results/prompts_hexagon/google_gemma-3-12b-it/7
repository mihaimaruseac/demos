Let $n$ be the number written in the hexagonal grid. We are given that the numbers are written in a spiral, and we want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid. We can think of the neighbors of a number $n$ as the numbers that are one step away from it in any of the six directions.

Let's consider the hexagonal grid. We can represent the grid as a set of coordinates $(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. The neighbors of a cell $(x,y)$ are:
$(x+1, y)$, $(x-1, y)$, $(x, y+1)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$
The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
However, this is not how the numbers are arranged in the spiral.

Let's examine the given spiral:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can observe that the numbers increase in the spiral pattern. We can also see that the neighbors of a number are the numbers surrounding it in the spiral.
We are given that the number 2026 is in the spiral. We want to find its 6 neighbors. Let $n = 2026$. We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors.

In the given example, the neighbors of 1 are 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 8. Their sum is $5+6+7+2+3+8 = 31$.
The neighbors of 5 are 1, 6, 2, 15, 4, 3. Their sum is $1+6+2+15+4+3 = 31$.
The neighbors of 6 are 5, 7, 16, 1, 15, 7. Their sum is $5+7+16+1+15+7 = 51$.
This doesn't seem to have a pattern.

Instead, let's look at the neighbors of a number $n$ in a hexagonal grid.
The neighbors are $n-1$, $n+1$, $n-d_1$, $n+d_1$, $n-d_2$, $n+d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the distances to the neighbors.
The numbers in the hexagonal grid form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $1$ in each direction. The neighbors of $n$ are $n-1, n+1$, and the other four neighbors are $n-x, n+x$ for some $x$.
The sum of the neighbors is $n-1 + n+1 + (n-x) + (n+x) + (n-y) + (n+y) = 6n$.

However, in the hexagonal grid, the numbers are not in an arithmetic progression. The spiral layout means the neighbors might not be uniformly spaced.
The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$ for a regular hexagonal grid. Let's consider the neighbors of 2026. The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 is expected to be $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Consider the neighbors of 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Sum = 27.
$6 \times 1 = 6$, and the sum of neighbors is 27.
Neighbors of 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 15. Sum = 37.
$6 \times 5 = 30$.
Neighbors of 6: 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16. Sum = 54.
$6 \times 6 = 36$.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
