Let the hexagonal grid be arranged such that the numbers are written in a spiral starting from the center. We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

Let $(x, y)$ be the coordinates of a number in the hexagonal grid, with the origin being the center. The coordinates are determined by the hexagonal grid. Let $n$ be the number in the grid. Then the neighbors of $n$ are $n-1$, $n-6$, $n-7$, $n+1$, $n+6$, $n+7$ (in some order). The neighbors of a number $n$ are $n-r$, $n-s$, $n-t$, $n+r$, $n+s$, $n+t$, where $r, s, t$ are the differences in the coordinates.
We are given the number 2026, and we want to find the sum of its 6 neighbors. Let the 6 neighbors be $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_6$. Then we want to find $n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_6$.

In the given hexagonal spiral, the neighbors are $n-1, n+1, n-6, n+6, n-7, n+7$. However, this does not work in all cases.

The neighbors of a number $n$ are the six numbers surrounding it in the hexagonal grid. In the hexagonal grid, we can represent the neighbors of a number $n$ by adding or subtracting vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6$, where $v_i$ are vectors representing the directions of the neighbors.
However, in the spiral arrangement, we can't simply use these vectors.

In the spiral, the numbers are arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The number 1 is in the center. The number 2 is one of the six neighbors of 1. The number 3 is another neighbor of 1, and so on.
The neighbors of $n$ are the numbers adjacent to $n$ in the hexagonal grid. In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. The sum of the neighbors of a number is usually related to the number itself.
Let $n$ be the given number. Then the sum of the six neighbors is typically $6n$. However, this is not necessarily true in a spiral.

Let $n$ be the number in the center of the hexagon. Then the six neighbors are $n-1, n+1, n-2, n+2, n-3, n+3$. Then the sum of the neighbors is $6n$.
We want to find the sum of the six neighbors of 2026.
The neighbors of $n$ are $n-1$, $n+1$, $n-6$, $n+6$, $n-7$, $n+7$.
So the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $(2026-1) + (2026+1) + (2026-6) + (2026+6) + (2026-7) + (2026+7) = 2025 + 2027 + 2020 + 2032 + 2019 + 2033$.
The sum is $2025+2027+2020+2032+2019+2033 = 12156$.
However, the hexagonal grid has six neighbors, not just the numbers above and below.
In general, the sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$. However, this doesn't hold for the beginning of the spiral.
The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27 = 6(1) + 21$.
The neighbors of 2 are 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. The sum is $1+3+5+6+7+8 = 30 = 6(2) + 18$.

The numbers in the hexagonal grid are arranged in a spiral pattern. The neighbors of $n$ are the six numbers adjacent to $n$ in the grid. Let the six neighbors of $n$ be $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_6$. The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_6$.

The neighbors of 2026 are $2025, 2027, 2020, 2032, 2019, 2033$. The sum is $12156$.
However, $12156/6 = 2026$, so the sum is $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
