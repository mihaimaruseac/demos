Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern. The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal spiral, starting from 1 in the center and moving outwards.

2) We can see that the numbers along the same "spoke" of the spiral form an arithmetic sequence. For example, 1, 2, 9, 10... form one spoke.

3) The common difference of each spoke is the number of "shell" it belongs to. The first shell is just 1, the second shell has 6 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), the third shell has 12 numbers, and so on. Each shell has 6 more numbers than the previous one.

4) So, we can find the shell number of 2026 by solving the inequality:

   1 + 6 + 12 +... + 6n ≥ 2026

   This is an arithmetic series with first term 6 and common difference 6. We can find its sum:

   S = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)
     = 3n(n+1)
     ≥ 2025
     = 45 * 45

   Solving for positive integer values, we get n = 18.

5) Now, we can find the first number in the 18th shell:

   1 + 6 + 12 +... + 6(17) = 3 * 17 * 18 = 918

6) The last number in the 18th shell is:

   918 + 6 * 17 = 1080

7) The number 2026 is in the 19th shell. The first number in this shell is 1081 and the last number is 1081 + 6 * 18 = 1245.

8) In each shell, the neighbors are always 1 shell number away. So, the neighbors of 2026 are 6 numbers away from it in the same shell.

9) The neighbors are: 2026 ± 6, 2026 ± 12, 2026 ± 18

   2020, 2032, 2014, 2038, 2008, 2044

10) The sum of the neighbors is:

    2020 + 2032 + 2014 + 2038 + 2008 + 2044 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12156.
