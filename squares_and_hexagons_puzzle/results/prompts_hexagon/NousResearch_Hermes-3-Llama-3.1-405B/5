Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern. The numbers are arranged in a spiral, starting from 1 and moving outwards. Each complete "ring" of the spiral contains 6 more numbers than the previous ring.

2) The first ring (immediately surrounding 1) contains numbers 2-7, which is 6 numbers. The second ring (numbers 8-19) contains 12 numbers. In general, the nth ring contains 6n numbers.

3) Now, let's find out in which ring 2026 lies. We can do this by summing up the number of numbers in each ring until we pass 2026:

   1 (for the central 1)
   + 6 (first ring)
   + 12 (second ring)
   + 18 (third ring)
   +...

   We can keep adding until the sum exceeds 2026, keep track of the sum and the ring number:

   Ring 1: 1 + 6 = 7
   Ring 2: 7 + 12 = 19
   Ring 3: 19 + 18 = 37
  ...
   Ring 22: 2207

   At the 22nd ring, the sum exceeds 2026, so 2026 lies in the 22nd ring.

4) In the 22nd ring, the numbers are from 1987 to 2206. The sum of the neighbors for each number in the ring will be the same (since the difference between adjacent numbers is constant).

5) So, let's calculate the sum for the first number in the ring (1987):

   1987 + 1988 + 1989 + 1990 + 1991 + 1992 = 11937

6) Therefore, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is also 11937.

So, the answer is 11937.
