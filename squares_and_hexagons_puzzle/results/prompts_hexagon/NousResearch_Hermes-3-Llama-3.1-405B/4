To find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

The spiral is formed by laying out numbers in a hexagonal pattern, starting from the center (1) and moving out in layers. Each layer is a hexagonal ring around the previous one. The number of numbers in each layer increases by 6 for each layer we move outwards because each layer adds one number to each of the six sides of the hexagon.

Let's call the layer number n, where n starts at 0 for the center (1). The number of numbers in each layer is 6n. The total number of numbers up to and including layer n is the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total numbers up to layer n = 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 +... + 6n
= 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 +... + n)
= 1 + 6 * (n(n+1)/2)
= 1 + 3n(n+1)

To find the layer in which 2026 falls, we solve for n in the equation:

1 + 3n(n+1) >= 2026

Let's solve for n:

3n^2 + 3n + 1 >= 2026
3n^2 + 3n >= 2025
n^2 + n >= 675
n^2 + n - 675 >= 0

We need to find the smallest integer n such that the inequality holds. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the corresponding equation:

n = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

For our equation, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -675. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us:

n = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*675)) / 2
n = (-1 ± sqrt(2701)) / 2
n = (-1 ± 51) / 2

We have two potential solutions for n: n = (51 - 1) / 2 = 25 and n = (-1 - 51) / 2 (which is negative and not relevant for our purposes). So, n = 25 is the layer in which 2026 falls.

Now, we need to find the exact position of 2026 within the 25th layer. We know that by the end of the 24th layer, we have:

Total numbers up to layer 24 = 1 + 3*24*25
= 1 + 1800
= 1801

So, 2026 is the (2026 - 1801) = 225th number in the 25th layer.

Each side of the hexagonal layer has 25 numbers, so 2026 will be on the 225 // 25 = 9th side (since we start counting from zero), which is actually the third side (since we wrap around after the sixth side).

Now, let's find the neighbors:

- The first and sixth neighbors are always one less and one more than the number itself, so they are 2025 and 2027.
- The second and fifth neighbors are the numbers that are 25 less and 25 more than the number itself, so they are 2001 and 2051.
- The third and fourth neighbors are the numbers that are 24 less and 24 more than the number itself, so they are 2002 and 2050.

The sum of the six neighbors is:

2025 + 2027 + 2001 + 2051 + 2002 + 2050 = 12156

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is 12156.
