To solve this problem, we need to understand how the numbers are arranged in the hexagonal spiral. The numbers are placed in rings around the center (which is 1). Each ring is formed by a hexagonal shape that surrounds the previous ring.

Let's start by identifying the rings and their corresponding numbers:

- Ring 0: 1
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- And so on...

The number of numbers in each ring increases by 6 for each subsequent ring. The first number of each ring can be found by the formula:

First number of ring n = 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 +... + (n-1))
First number of ring n = 1 + 3n(n-1)

To find the ring in which 2026 lies, we need to find the largest ring number n such that the first number of ring n is less than or equal to 2026.

Let's do the calculation:

1 + 3n(n-1) <= 2026
3n^2 - 3n + 1 <= 2026
n^2 - n + 1/3 <= 675.333...

Now, we solve for n:

n^2 - n - 674.666... >= 0

Using the quadratic formula, we find the positive root, which gives us the ring number. However, we don't need the exact ring number; we just need to find the first number of the ring that contains 2026. We can do this by trial and error or by using a more sophisticated method. Let's try finding the ring by incrementing n:

For n = 1, the first number is 2.
For n = 2, the first number is 8.
...
We keep incrementing until we find the ring.

After trying different values of n, we find that for n = 18, the first number is 1 + 3*18*17 = 1939, and for n = 19, the first number is 1 + 3*19*18 = 2053. Therefore, 2026 is in the 18th ring.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 18th ring:

2026 - 1939 = 87

The 18th ring has 6 * 18 = 108 numbers. Since 87 is more than half of 108, we know that 2026 is in the second half of the 18th ring.

The second half of the ring has positions that are adjacent to the next ring (the 19th ring), which starts with 2053. Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 will include the number 2053 + 87 = 2140.

The sum of the neighbors will be:

2025 (the number before 2026) +
2027 (the number after 2026) +
2 * (2026 - 18) (two numbers from the inner ring, which is 18 numbers away) +
2 * (2140) (two numbers from the outer ring)

Let's calculate the sum:

2025 + 2027 + 2 * (2008) + 2 * (2140) =
2025 + 2027 + 4016 + 4280 =
12348

So, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12348.
