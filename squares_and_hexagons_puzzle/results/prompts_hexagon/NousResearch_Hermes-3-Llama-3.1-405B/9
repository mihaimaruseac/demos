To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid. The spiral starts at 1 and goes around in a clockwise direction, with each complete "hexagon" layer adding a new "side" to the spiral.

Let's break down the spiral into layers:

- Layer 0: just the number 1.
- Layer 1: the numbers 2 through 7 form the first hexagon around 1.
- Layer 2: the numbers 8 through 19 form the second hexagon.
- And so on.

Each layer starts with the next number after the last number of the previous layer. The number of numbers in each layer increases by 6 each time because each new hexagon adds one more number to each of its six sides.

Let's find out which layer the number 2026 belongs to and where it is located within that layer.

First, we need to find the cumulative sum of numbers in each layer until we reach or exceed 2026:

- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
-...

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the cumulative sum for each layer: Sum = n/2 * (first number + last number), where n is the count of numbers in the layer.

We can also calculate the last number of each layer using the formula: Last number = First number + (Side length * 6 - 1), where Side length is the number of numbers on one side of the hexagon (which is equal to the layer number + 1).

Let's calculate the last number of each layer until we find the layer that contains 2026.

Layer 1: Last number = 2 + (1 * 6 - 1) = 7
Layer 2: Last number = 8 + (2 * 6 - 1) = 19
Layer 3: Last number = 20 + (3 * 6 - 1) = 37
Layer 4: Last number = 38 + (4 * 6 - 1) = 61
Layer 5: Last number = 62 + (5 * 6 - 1) = 91
Layer 6: Last number = 92 + (6 * 6 - 1) = 127
Layer 7: Last number = 128 + (7 * 6 - 1) = 169
Layer 8: Last number = 170 + (8 * 6 - 1) = 217
Layer 9: Last number = 218 + (9 * 6 - 1) = 271
...
We continue this process until we find the layer that contains 2026.

Once we find the layer, we need to determine the position of 2026 within that layer to identify its six neighbors. The six neighbors will be the numbers immediately before and after 2026 in the spiral order, as well as the four numbers that are adjacent to it on the hexagonal grid.

Let's assume we have found the layer and position of 2026. The six neighbors can be identified as follows:

- The number before and after 2026 in the spiral order.
- The numbers that are on the same "side" of the hexagon as 2026 but one step towards the center and one step towards the edge of the hexagon.
- The numbers that are on the adjacent "sides" of the hexagon, which are the numbers that are diagonally adjacent to 2026 on the hexagonal grid.

Once we have identified these six numbers, we can add them together to get the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

However, this process is quite complex and would require further calculation to determine the exact numbers. If you're looking for a specific answer, we would need to continue the calculations as described above.
