To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are laid out on the hexagonal grid. The spiral starts at 1 and goes around in a clockwise direction, with each new "layer" of the spiral starting after the square of an odd number.

Let's break it down:

1. The first "layer" is just the number 1.
2. The second "layer" starts after 1^2 = 1 and ends at 3^2 = 9. It contains the numbers 2 to 9.
3. The third "layer" starts after 3^2 = 9 and ends at 5^2 = 25. It contains the numbers 10 to 25.
4. And so on...

The number 2026 lies between the squares of which two odd numbers? Let's find out:

45^2 = 2025
47^2 = 2209

So, 2026 is in the "layer" that starts after 45^2 = 2025 and ends at 47^2 = 2209.

Now, let's find the position of 2026 in this layer. Since 2026 is the second number in this layer, it is directly to the right of 2025.

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (to the right)
- 2024 and 2023 (the two numbers below)
- 2046 and 2047 (the two numbers above)

Let's calculate these numbers:

2025 is given.
2027 is 2026 + 1.
2024 and 2023 are 2026 - 1 and 2026 - 2.
2046 and 2047 are a bit trickier. We know that 2026 is at the bottom of the layer, so we need to go up one layer to find these numbers. The difference between the squares of the two consecutive odd numbers (45 and 47) is 2209 - 2025 = 184. Half of this difference is 92, which is the length of the side of this hexagonal layer. So, 2046 is 2026 - 45 (the side length of the previous layer), and 2047 is 2046 + 1.

Now we can add up all these neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2046 + 2047 = 12172

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12172.
