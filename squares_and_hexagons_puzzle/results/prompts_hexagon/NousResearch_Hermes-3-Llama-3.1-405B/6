Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern. The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid. Each number has 6 neighbors.

2) Now, let's look at the numbers around 1. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The sum of these numbers is 27.

3) Let's see if we can find a pattern. The numbers around 2 are 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The sum of these numbers is 42.

4) The numbers around 3 are 1, 2, 4, 12, 13, and 14. The sum of these numbers is 46.

5) Do you see a pattern? The sum of the neighbors is increasing by a certain amount each time. From 1 to 2, it increased by 15 (42 - 27 = 15). From 2 to 3, it increased by 4 (46 - 42 = 4).

6) This pattern continues. The difference between the sums of the neighbors of consecutive numbers increases by 1 each time.

7) We can use this pattern to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026. But instead of doing it manually, let's use a formula.

8) The formula is: Sum of neighbors = 27 + (n - 1) * (15 + (n - 2) * (n - 1) / 2), where n is the number.

9) Plugging in n = 2026, we get:

   Sum of neighbors = 27 + (2026 - 1) * (15 + (2026 - 2) * (2026 - 1) / 2)
                    = 27 + 2025 * (15 + 2024 * 2025 / 2)
                    = 27 + 2025 * (15 + 2048000 / 2)
                    = 27 + 2025 * (15 + 1024000)
                    = 27 + 2025 * 1024015
                    = 27 + 2075130375
                    = 2075130402

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 2075130402.
