To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. The number 1 is at the center.
2. The numbers 2 to 7 form a hexagon around 1.
3. The numbers 8 to 19 form a larger hexagon around the previous one.
4. This pattern continues, with each layer adding a larger hexagon.

Let's call the layer number L. The center is L=0, the first hexagon is L=1, the second hexagon is L=2, and so on. We can see that each layer L contains 6L numbers.

The largest number in each layer is the sum of all numbers in all previous layers plus the numbers in the current layer. So, the largest number in layer L is:

1 + (6 * 1) + (6 * 2) +... + (6 * L)
= 1 + 6 * (1 + 2 +... + L)
= 1 + 6 * (L * (L+1) / 2)
= 1 + 3 * L * (L+1)

We need to find the layer L in which 2026 lies. We can do this by solving the inequality:

1 + 3 * L * (L+1) >= 2026

Let's solve for L:

1 + 3 * L^2 + 3 * L >= 2026
3 * L^2 + 3 * L >= 2025
L^2 + L >= 675
L^2 + L - 675 >= 0

We can solve this quadratic inequality to find the smallest integer L that satisfies it. We can use the quadratic formula, where a=1, b=1, and c=-675:

L = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
L = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * 675)) / 2
L = (-1 ± sqrt(2701)) / 2
L = (-1 ± 52) / 2

The positive solution is L = (52 - 1) / 2 = 25.5. Since L must be an integer, we round up to the next integer, which is L = 26.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 in the 26th layer. The largest number in the 25th layer is:

1 + 3 * 25 * (25+1) = 1 + 3 * 25 * 26 = 1951

So, 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in the 26th layer.

Each side of the hexagon in the 26th layer contains 26 numbers, so the 75th number is on the 75 // 26 = 2nd side (since 75 // 26 = 2 with remainder 23, it's the 23rd number on the 2nd side).

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- The previous number on the same side: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- The next number on the same side: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- The three numbers on the previous side: 2026 - 26 = 2000, 2000 - 1 = 1999, and 2000 + 1 = 2001
- The three numbers on the next side: 2026 + 26 = 2052, 2052 - 1 = 2051, and 2052 + 1 = 2053

The sum of all 6 neighbors is:

2025 + 2027 + 1999 + 2000 + 2001 + 2051 + 2052 + 2053 = 12108
