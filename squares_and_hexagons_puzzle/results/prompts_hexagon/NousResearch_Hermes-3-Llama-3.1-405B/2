Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern. The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal spiral, starting from the center (1), and then going clockwise (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,...).

2) The six neighbors of a number are the numbers that are directly adjacent to it in the hexagonal grid.

3) To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine its position in the spiral. We can do this by finding the "ring" it belongs to. The rings are the concentric hexagons that make up the spiral.

4) The first ring is just the number 1. The second ring consists of the numbers 2 through 7. The third ring is 8 through 19, and so on. Each ring starts with a square number (1, 4, 9, 16,...).

5) To find the ring of 2026, we need to find the largest square number less than 2026. This is 44^2 = 1936. So 2026 is in the 45th ring.

6) Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 45th ring. The 45th ring starts at 1980 (1936 + 44 = 1980). So 2026 is the 46th number in the 45th ring (2026 - 1980 = 46).

7) The 45th ring has 6 * 44 = 264 numbers. The 46th number is in the first side of the ring (46 < 44), so its neighbors are the 45th number in the 45th ring (2025), the 47th number in the 45th ring (2027), the 2nd number in the 44th ring (1981), the 44th number in the 46th ring (2071), the 45th number in the 46th ring (2072), and the 46th number in the 46th ring (2073).

8) Therefore, the sum of the neighbors is 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2071 + 2072 + 2073 = 12126.

So the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is 12126.
