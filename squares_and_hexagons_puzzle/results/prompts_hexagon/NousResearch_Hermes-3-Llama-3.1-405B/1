Let's solve this step by step:

1) The numbers are arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. This means that each number has 6 neighbors, except for the first and last numbers in each "ring" of the spiral.

2) To find the sum of the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine the numbers that surround 2026 in the spiral.

3) Let's look at the pattern of the spiral:

   - 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
   - 2 is surrounded by 1, 3, 8, 9, and 10
   - 3 is surrounded by 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, and 14
   - and so on

4) The spiral can be divided into "rings". The first ring is just the number 1. The second ring consists of the numbers 2 through 7. The third ring is 8 through 19, and so on.

5) To find the ring containing 2026, let's count the number of numbers in each ring:

   - Ring 1: 1 number (1)
   - Ring 2: 6 numbers (2-7)
   - Ring 3: 12 numbers (8-19)
   - Ring 4: 18 numbers (20-37)
   - and so on

   The number of numbers in each ring increases by 6 each time.

6) We can calculate the number of numbers in each ring until the total exceeds 2026:

   - Ring 1: 1
   - Ring 2: 1 + 6 = 7
   - Ring 3: 7 + 12 = 19
   - Ring 4: 19 + 18 = 37
   - and so on

   After the 18th ring, the total is 1993. After the 19th ring, the total is 2145. Therefore, 2026 is in the 19th ring.

7) The numbers in the 19th ring are 1994 to 2145. The neighbors of 2026 in this ring are 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.

8) The sum of these neighbors is: 2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 = 12115

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12115.
