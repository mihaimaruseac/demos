Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on this hexagonal spiral. Hmm, let me start by understanding how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid. 

First, I remember that in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. The example given starts with 1 in the center. Then, I need to figure out the pattern of how numbers are added around the center. In square spirals, there's a certain pattern that emerges with layers or rings, maybe something similar applies here?

Looking at the example provided:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, 1 is in the center. Then moving clockwise around it are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Wait, let me check. The first example seems to have numbers spiraling out. Let me try to visualize the spiral.

Starting from 1 in the center. Moving right, then up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right, etc.? Maybe. Let me try to reconstruct the spiral step by step.

First, layer 0: just the center number 1.

Layer 1: Numbers surrounding 1. How many numbers are in each layer? In square spirals, each layer adds a certain number of numbers. But for hexagonal, I think each layer is a hexagon. The formula for the number of numbers in each hexagonal layer is 6*n, where n is the layer number. So layer 1 (the first ring around the center) has 6*1 = 6 numbers. Then layer 2 would have 12 numbers, layer 3 18 numbers, etc. Let me check if the example supports that.

Looking at the example given, numbers 2 to 7 are in the first ring (since 1 is center). Let's count: from the example, numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16... Hmm, maybe the numbers increase as you go around. Wait, maybe the first ring (around 1) is numbers 2-7 (6 numbers), then the next ring (layer 2) is numbers 8-... Let me check. 

In the second layer, numbers would start at 8? Let's see. If 1 is center, then layer 1: numbers 2-7. Then layer 2: numbers 8 to 8 + 12 - 1 = 19. Then layer 3: 20 to 20 + 18 -1 = 37, and so on. Let me check if that matches the example given. For instance, numbers at the start of layer 2 would be 8, which is listed in the example. Then numbers 8, 9, 10, 11,... up to 19. In the example, we have numbers like 8, 9, 10, but also 14, 15, 16 that seem to be in layer 2. 

So maybe the formula is correct: each layer n (starting from layer 0 at center) has 6n numbers. Then total numbers up to layer n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). Let me confirm with n=1: 1 + 3*1*2 = 7 numbers total. Which would be 1 (center) + 6 numbers in layer 1. So numbers 1 to 7. Then layer 2 would take numbers from 8 to 8 + 12 = 20? Wait, 1 + 3*2*(2+1) = 1 + 3*2*3 = 1 + 18 = 19. So numbers up to layer 2 is 19. Therefore, layer 2 has 12 numbers (from 8 to 19). So layer n has 6n numbers. So layer 1: n=1, 6 numbers. Layer 2: n=2, 12 numbers. So that seems correct.

So, given that, the first step is to figure out which layer 2026 is in. So, we need to find n such that 1 + 3n(n+1) is just greater than or equal to 2026. Let me write down the formula:

Total numbers up to and including layer m is T(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1). So we need to solve for m where T(m-1) < 2026 ≤ T(m). Let's compute T(m):

Let me rearrange the equation 1 + 3m(m+1) ≥ 2026 => 3m(m+1) ≥ 2025 => m(m+1) ≥ 675.

We can approximate m^2 ≈ 675 => m ≈ sqrt(675) ≈ 25.98. So let's check m=25: 25*26 = 650 < 675. m=26: 26*27 = 702 ≥ 675. So m=26. Therefore, 2026 is in layer m=26. Wait, but m here is the layer number? Wait, the formula says T(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1). But if m=26, then T(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107. So total numbers up to layer 26 is 2107. Then total numbers up to layer 25 is T(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951. Therefore, numbers in layer 26 are from 1952 to 2107. So 2026 is in layer 26. Let me check: 2026 - 1951 = 75. Therefore, 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26. Since layer 26 has 6*26 = 156 numbers. So position within the layer is 75. Wait, but 2107 - 1951 = 156 numbers. Correct, 6*26=156. So 2026 is 1951 + 75 = 2026. So within layer 26, it's the 75th number. 

Now, the next step is to figure out where exactly in the spiral 2026 is located, so that I can find its neighbors. For that, I need to know the structure of each layer. In a hexagonal spiral, each layer can be thought of as six "arms" or "sides", each of length n (for layer n). Wait, for layer m, each side is m numbers long? Let me think. 

For example, layer 1: 6 numbers, each side has 1 number. So total of 6*1=6. For layer 2: 12 numbers, so each side has 2 numbers. So each of the six sides has m numbers. Therefore, in general, each layer m has six arms, each with m numbers. Therefore, in layer m, each side has m numbers. Therefore, the total numbers in the layer is 6m. Therefore, for layer m, we can divide the numbers into six "sides", each of length m. 

Therefore, for layer 26, each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, each side is 26 numbers long. Therefore, the 75th number in layer 26 is located on which side? Let's divide 75 by 26. 26*2 = 52, 26*3=78. So 75 is 2 full sides (each with 26 numbers) and 75-2*26=75-52=23rd number on the 3rd side. Therefore, 75 = 2*26 + 23. Therefore, it's in the third side of layer 26. 

Now, the question is: how does this translate to position? To determine the position, we need to know which direction each side is going. In a hexagonal grid, moving around the spiral. Let me try to imagine the directions.

Assuming the spiral is constructed in a similar fashion to the square spiral, but with six directions. Let me think. Let me try to think of how the spiral is constructed. 

Starting at the center (1), moving to the right (2), then turning 60 degrees clockwise, then up-right (3), then turning again, etc. Wait, but how exactly is the spiral constructed? Maybe each layer is built by moving in a straight line of m numbers, then turning 60 degrees, repeating six times. 

Alternatively, in order to model coordinates, maybe we can use axial coordinates for hexagonal grids. But perhaps I need to figure out a way to map the numbers to coordinates. However, since I don't have the exact coordinate system, maybe I need another approach. 

Alternatively, for each number in the spiral, we can determine its distance from the center (layer number) and its position within the layer (side and offset). Then, based on that, figure out the neighbors. 

But perhaps there's a pattern for the neighbors. For example, in square spirals, each number has neighbors which can be determined by the layer and position. Maybe similar here. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the hexagonal spiral as similar to the square spiral but with an extra direction. Let me try to think of how numbers are arranged in the spiral. 

Looking back at the example given:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, if you start at 1, moving to the right (2), then up-right (3), then up-left (4), then left (5), then down-left (6), then down-right (7), then right again to start layer 2 (8). Wait, after 7, moving to the right? To get to 8? But how? Wait:

Looking at the example, after 7, the next number is 8, then 9, 10, etc. So perhaps after completing a full loop around the center, the spiral moves outward. 

Hmm. Alternatively, each new layer is formed by moving in a straight line, then turning, similar to a square spiral, but with six turns. 

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers increase as you spiral outward, and each layer adds a ring. Let me think of the coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the neighbors. Let me think of the coordinates of numbers in the hexagonal spiral.

But since I don't have a coordinate system, maybe another approach is to note that in a hexagonal spiral, each layer is a ring around the center. Each number in the ring can be represented by a distance from center and an angular coordinate. But perhaps it's complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe we can figure out the coordinates of 2026 relative to the center, then find its neighbors. For that, I need to know how numbers are placed in the spiral. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the spiral as moving in six directions, each direction being a step. In hexagonal grids, directions can be represented with axial coordinates (q, r, s), but maybe that's too complex. 

Alternatively, let's think of the numbers on each side of the layer. 

In each layer m, the six sides can be considered as follows:

Let me think for layer 1 (m=1). Starting at the first number after center, which is 2, the first side is from the end of the previous layer (which is 1) moving in some direction. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to reconstruct the spiral step by step.

Starting with 1 at the center. Then, going right to 2, then up-right to 3, up-left to 4, left to 5, down-left to 6, down-right to 7, then right to 8? Wait, but how does the movement work? 

Alternatively, in hexagonal spirals, the movement goes out along a direction, turns 60 degrees, goes along that direction, and so on. Let me consider directions as follows: suppose we have six primary directions from a hexagon: let's say, for example, directions E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE. Then the spiral moves along each direction for m steps for layer m. 

For example, starting at the center (1). To build layer 1 (radius 1), we move in direction 1: E (right) to 2, then turn 60 degrees clockwise to NE (direction 2) to 3, then another 60 degrees to NW (direction 3) to 4, then another 60 to W (direction 4) to 5, then another 60 to SW (direction 5) to 6, then another 60 to SE (direction 6) to 7, then back to the start of layer 1. 

Then for layer 2, to go around it, we need to move in each direction 2 steps. So starting from 7, moving in direction SE? Wait, perhaps after completing layer 1, the next layer starts. Wait, perhaps the direction after finishing layer 1 is direction E again? 

Alternatively, perhaps after constructing each side of the layer, you turn 60 degrees. Let me try to reconstruct the numbers. 

Starting with 1. Then moving East:

Layer 1, side 1: move E (east) to place numbers 2.

Then turn 60 degrees towards NE (next direction). Move NE to place 3.

Then turn 60 degrees towards NW. Move NW to place 4.

Then turn 60 degrees towards W. Move W to place 5.

Then turn 60 degrees towards SW. Move SW to place 6.

Then turn 60 degrees towards SE. Move SE to place 7.

Now to start layer 2, we need to turn another 60 degrees? Or turn back? Wait, after placing 7, which completes layer 1, to go back, perhaps you turn 60 degrees again? But that would bring you to direction E again? Wait, no. If you turned 60 degrees each time, then after placing layer 1, you are facing the starting direction again. Wait, each turn is 60 degrees, but total number of sides is 6, so full circle is 6*60=360 degrees. So starting direction (east), after placing the 6 sides of layer 1, you end up facing east again. Therefore, to start layer 2, you turn another 60 degrees and go in the same way. 

Therefore, after 7, to start layer 2, moving in direction E again? Wait no, because after completing the last step of layer 1 (which was moving in SE direction to place 7), you have turned 6*60=360 degrees. So facing the original direction again. Therefore, to start layer 2, you need to turn another 60 degrees and start moving again? Or perhaps to continue the spiral, after completing a full loop, you turn left or right? Hmm, maybe I need a better approach. 

Alternatively, let's look at the example numbers in the spiral:

Looking at numbers 8, 9, 10, etc. For example, after 7, the next number is 8. According to the given grid, in the example, after 7 is 8, then 9, 10, etc. If I imagine that after placing 7, the next movement is to go east again to place 8? But in the example, number 8 is adjacent to 7 and 9. Let me check the grid:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, 7 is adjacent to 8 and 6. So, if 7 is connected to 8, then direction from 7 to 8 is east? Because in the grid, moving from 7 to 8 is to the right in the bottom row. So if 6,7,8 are on a straight line, then moving from 6 to 7 to 8 is east direction? Then after 7, you continue east to place 8. Then, after placing 8, turn 60 degrees clockwise (which would be northeast) and start placing numbers? Then 9 would be placed in that direction. Then next 60 degrees, etc. 

So, layer 2 would start with moving east from 7 to 8, then turning to northeast (next direction) and placing 9, then north-west? Wait, let me check the example. The number after 8 is 9. In the example grid, 8 is followed by ...? The given grid shows a part where 8 is at the end of the bottom row. Let me see:

In the given grid, looking at the second layer (layer 2), which starts at 8. The numbers in the second layer likely go from 8 to 19. The given grid shows numbers 8, 9 in that layer. According to the example, 9 is next to 8 and 2. Looking at the grid:

The line with 9 is "... 2 9 ...". So 2 is adjacent to 9, which is adjacent to 8. So 9 is northeast of 8? If 8 is at the bottom right, then 9 is northeast of 8. So from 8, turning northeast direction. So yes, after moving east from 7 to 8, turn 60 degrees clockwise (which would be northeast) and move in that direction for the next side of layer 2. That would be two steps because layer 2 has m=2, so each side has 2 numbers. 

Wait, layer 2 has m=2, so each side has 2 numbers. Therefore, starting from 8, moving east for one step (but wait, already placed 8 by moving east from 7, so maybe the first side of layer 2 is movement in that direction for m=2 numbers? Wait, earlier example: layer 1 has m=1, each side has 1 number. Starting from 2 (east), moving east 1 number, then turning... So for layer m, starting at the end of the previous layer, you move in direction for m numbers? 

Wait, let me think again. For layer m, each side has m numbers. So layer 1: each side has 1 number. So starting from the center, moving east to 2 (1 number). Then moving northeast to 3 (1 number). Then northwest to 4, etc. For layer 2: each side has 2 numbers. So after completing layer 1, which ends at 7, we start layer 2 by moving in the same direction as the last move of layer 1, which was SE (to get from 6 to 7)? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to figure out the order.

Alternatively, perhaps each layer starts with a new direction. Maybe after completing a full loop of the previous layer, you turn left or something. This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I need a formulaic way to figure out where a number is located on the spiral.

Alternatively, since we know the layer m=26 and the position within the layer (75th number, which is 23rd on the third side), maybe we can figure out the coordinates relative to the center and then compute neighbors. 

Assuming that the direction of the sides is consistent. Let's assume that the six sides are going in directions which can be represented as vectors in coordinate system. For example, in axial coordinates for hexagons, there are three axes, but perhaps we can use offset coordinates or something similar. Alternatively, assign directions as steps in a coordinate system.

For example, in one system, you can use x, y coordinates where each hexagon can be addressed. In axial coordinates, there are three coordinates (q, r, s) with q + r + s = 0. But maybe in this case, it's easier to use "offset coordinates" for axial, where q and r are offset based on even or odd rows. 

Alternatively, perhaps use cube coordinates for hexagons. In cubic coordinates, each hexagon is represented by (x, y, z) where x + y + z = 0. Moving in six directions corresponds to adding one of the six standard vectors: (-1, 1, 0), (0, 1, -1), (1, 0, -1), (1, -1, 0), (0, -1, 1), (-1, 0, 1). 

But perhaps this is getting too complex. Alternatively, since I need to find neighbors of 2026, maybe I can figure out the coordinates of 2026, then add the neighbor vectors and find the numbers at those positions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern for the neighbors based on the layer and position on the layer. 

Let me try to think about the coordinates. Let me try to find the position of a number in layer m, on side k (from 0 to 5), at position p along that side (from 0 to m-1). 

First, the center is 1 at position (0, 0, 0). Let me assume cube coordinates. 

But how to determine the coordinates based on layer and position. 

Alternatively, each side of the layer is a straight line. The first side is, for example, the east side. The numbers on that side can be considered as moving from one corner to the next. 

But without knowing the exact starting point, this is challenging. Maybe I need to find a formula for the numbers on each side. 

Alternatively, think of the spiral as follows: 

Each layer m has numbers from T(m-1) + 1 to T(m), where T(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1). 

Each side of the layer has m numbers. 

For layer m, starting from the end of layer m-1 (which is T(m-1)), then moving in direction 1 for m numbers (side 1), then direction 2 for m numbers (side 2), etc. 

If I can figure out what the directions are, then for each number in a side, its coordinates can be determined by starting from the starting point of the side and moving in that direction for the offset. 

Therefore, first, I need to figure out the starting coordinate of each side. 

But since I don't have the exact coordinate system, maybe I need another approach. 

Alternatively, since the neighbors of a number in the spiral are adjacent to it, either in the same layer or in neighboring layers. For example, if 2026 is on side 3 of layer 26, then some of its neighbors might be on the same side or adjacent sides of layer 26, or on adjacent layers. 

But how to determine the numbers there?

Alternatively, maybe I can find the six neighbors by knowing the previous and next numbers on the same side, numbers at the corners, and numbers on adjacent layers. 

Let me think. 

In a hexagonal spiral, each number (except the center) has neighbors that include:

- The number before and after it on the same side of the layer.

- The numbers at the corners between sides.

- And numbers from adjacent layers.

But perhaps for a number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), its neighbors are:

- The previous number on the side.

- The next number on the side.

- The number from the preceding side (at the same position from the corner).

- The number from the following side (at the same position from the corner).

- And two numbers from neighboring layers (one from inner layer, one from outer layer? Or depending on the position).

Wait, perhaps it's complex. Let me try to look for a pattern with smaller numbers.

Take the number 2, which is on layer 1, side 1 (east direction). Its neighbors are 1 (center), 3 (on same layer, side 2), 4 (on same layer?), 9 (layer 2?),  something else. Wait from the example grid:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

The number 2 is at the end of the top row, adjacent to 1, 3, and 9. Looking at the neighbors, from the grid:

Looking at 2, which is in the second row: neighbors above are 3, to the right is 9, to the left is 1, and below is maybe something else? Wait, in the grid provided:

The line above the middle line is ".. 15 5 1 2 9 ...", so 2 is between 1 and 9. The upper line is "... 14 4 3 10 ...", so the number above 2 might be 3? Wait, but according to the grid:

The second row is .. 15 5 1 2 9 ... 

The first row above is ... 14 4 3 10 ... 

So between 2 and 3 is there? Maybe the grid is a hexagonal grid, not a square grid, so each row is offset. So the neighbors of 2 would be 1 (center), 3 (upper right?), 9 (right), maybe 4 (upper left?), and others. 

But without seeing the exact grid structure, it's hard to tell. Maybe I need to derive the coordinates.

Let me think of each number as having a coordinate (distance from center, angle). But converting that to actual numbers is tricky. 

Alternatively, note that in a hexagonal grid, the six neighbors of a cell are each one step in one of the six directions. If I can figure out the numbering pattern in terms of these directions, then I can figure out the numbers. 

Alternatively, let's think about the difference between numbers in the same layer. For example, in layer 1, the numbers go from 2-7. The difference between consecutive numbers on the same side is something. For example, on side 1 (east), from 2 to ..., what's next? In the example, after 2 is 9? Or is 2 on side 1 and the next number is on the next side? 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers on each side increase by a certain amount. For example, when you move along a side, how does the number change? 

For example, in layer 1 (numbers 2-7), moving from 2 (side 1) to 3 (side 2) is moving in a different direction. So along side 1 (east direction) there is only one number: 2. Then moving to side 2 (northeast direction): 3. Similarly for others. So for layer m, on each side, the numbers increase by some amount as you move along the side. 

Alternatively, let's think of how numbers are placed. Starting at center 1. To build layer 1, you go east to 2, then northeast to 3, northwest to 4, west to 5, southwest to 6, southeast to 7. Then to build layer 2, you go east again from 7 to 8, then northeast for two numbers (8 →9→...), northwest..., etc. 

Assuming that, then for each side of the layer, the numbers increase by a constant difference. For example, moving east from 7 to 8: difference is +1. Then, if you move northeast for the next side, the numbers might increase by a different amount. Let me see.

Wait, in square spirals, each layer has numbers increasing by a certain amount as you move along the side. For example, each side of a square spiral has numbers increasing by 2*(layer number) - 1. Maybe similar here?

Alternatively, in hexagonal spirals, the difference between numbers on the same side can be determined. Let's think. 

Let me consider layer 1 (m=1). Numbers 2-7. For example, moving east from 1 to 2. Then, to go from 2 to the start of the next layer, perhaps you need to figure out how numbers increase.

But since layer 2 starts at 8, which is adjacent to 7. From 7 (southeast direction of layer 1), moving east for layer 2's first side. So the numbers on east side of layer 2 are 8, ?, ..., depending on the length of the side (which is 2 numbers). 

So the first side of layer 2 has 2 numbers: 8 and then... Well, let's think. Moving east from 7 to 8. Then moving one more step east (m=2, side length 2), so next number is 9? Then, moving northeast for side 2 of layer 2: two numbers, 9→10→...? Wait, but after moving east from 7 to 8 and to 9, then turning northeast direction. Wait, if the first side (east) has two numbers (8 and 9), then the next side (northeast) would have two numbers: starting from 9, moving northeast for 2 numbers: 9→...? Then what number comes next? Let me check the example: in the example, 9 is adjacent to 2. Wait, according to the grid provided, the number 2 is adjacent to 9. So maybe after 9, moving in northeast direction, you get to 10? Then turning northwest direction... Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps when completing a side, the next number is at the corner. For example, in layer 2, side 1 (east): numbers 8 and 9. Then side 2 (northeast): numbers 9 and 10. Then side 3 (northwest): numbers 10 and 11. Then side 4 (west): numbers 11 and 12. Side 5 (southwest): numbers 12 and 13. Side 6 (southeast): numbers 13 and 14. Wait, but layer 2 is supposed to have 12 numbers (from 8 to 19). Wait, that's 6 sides, each with 2 numbers: total of 12. If starting at 8, then numbers are:

Side 1: 8, 9

Side 2: 9, 10

Side 3: 10, 11

Side 4: 11, 12

Side 5: 12, 13

Side 6: 13, 14

But then the last number is 14? But earlier calculation said layer 2 ends at 19. There's a contradiction here. So my assumption must be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe each side is m numbers long, starting from the corner. For example, in layer 2, starting at a corner (say, the end of layer 1: 7), moving east to place numbers 8, then 9. Then turning to northeast and placing 10, 11. Then northwest: 12, 13. West: 14, 15. Southwest: 16, 17. Southeast: 18, 19. So side 1: 8,9; side 2: 10,11; side 3: 12,13; side 4:14,15; side 5:16,17; side 6:18,19. Total 12 numbers from 8-19. Then that works. 

But how are the numbers connected? For example, side 1 ends at 9, then side 2 starts at 9? No, if side 1 is 8,9 and side 2 is 10,11, how do they connect? There must be overlap. Wait, maybe not. Perhaps each side starts at the end of the previous side. Wait, no. After moving from side 1 to complete it, you turn and start moving on side 2. Therefore, the first number on side 2 is adjacent to the last number of side 1. Therefore, if side 1 has numbers 8,9 (length 2), then side 2 starts at 9 (the last number of side 1), and moves in the new direction. Then side 2 would have numbers 9,10 (since it's length 2), then side 3 would start at 10, and have numbers 10,11, etc. Thus, the numbers would overlap at the corners. 

Therefore, for layer 2, numbers would be:

Side 1 (east): 8,9

Side 2 (northeast): 9,10

Side 3 (northwest): 10,11

Side 4 (west): 11,12

Side 5 (southwest): 12,13

Side 6 (southeast): 13,14

But this only gets us to 14, but we need up to 19. Therefore, clearly something is wrong with this approach. 

Ah! Because if each side of length m has m+1 numbers? Wait no. If it's a straight line of m steps, then there are m+1 numbers. But earlier I thought that layer m has 6m numbers, but if each side has m+1 numbers, overlapping at corners, then total would be 6m + something? 

Wait, for layer 2, if each side has m=2, then each side has 2+1=3 numbers. But overlapping at the corners. So total numbers would be 6*3 - 6 = 12 numbers. Which matches. For example, 3 per side minus the overlap of 1 at each corner. 

Therefore, for layer m, each side has m+1 numbers, but the corners are shared between sides. Therefore, total numbers in the layer is 6*(m+1) - 6 = 6m. Which is consistent with our earlier formula. Therefore, for layer m, each side has m+1 numbers, with overlapping at corners. 

Therefore, the numbers on the sides can be determined by starting at the beginning of the side, then increasing by a certain step as you move along the side. 

But how to determine what number is at each side and position. 

Let me try with layer 2. Starting at the end of layer 1, which is number 7. To start layer 2, we move east to place number 8, then continue east to 9. Then turn to northeast direction, placing number 10, 11. Then turn to northwest direction, placing 12, 13. Then turn to west, placing 14, 15. Then turn to southwest, placing 16, 17. Then turn to southeast, placing 18, 19. 

Wait, but how do we get from 7 to 8? The direction is east. So starting at 7, moving east to place 8, then east again to 9. Then turn northeast and place 10, then northeast again to 11. Then turn northwest to place 12, etc. This way, each side has m=2 steps, resulting in m+1=3 numbers? Wait, no. If each side is length m=2, it means you move in that direction two times, placing 3 numbers? But layer 2 has 6 sides * 2 = 12 numbers. With each side contributing 2+1=3 numbers but overlapping corners. 

Yes, with 6 sides, each contributing 2+1=3 numbers, but subtracting the overlaps (each corner counted twice), we get total numbers as 6*3 - 6= 12 numbers. 

Therefore, for layer m, each side has m steps, resulting in m+1 numbers per side. 

Given that, we can think of the numbers on each side. For layer 2, side 1 (east) has numbers 8,9; side 2 (northeast) has numbers 9,10; side 3 (northwest) has numbers 10,11; side 4 (west) has numbers 11,12; side 5 (southwest) has numbers 12,13; side 6 (southeast) has numbers 13,14. But wait, according to this, the last number in layer 2 is 14, but earlier we determined layer 2 ends at 19. There is a discrepancy. 

Therefore, my previous assumption is wrong. Where is the mistake? 

Ah! The numbering starts at T(m-1)+1. For layer 2, T(1) = 1 + 3*1*2 = 7. So first number in layer 2 is 8. If each side has m=2 steps, which is m+1=3 numbers, but in the above example, from 8 to 9 is 2 numbers (including the start), then the next side would add another 2 numbers, but overlapping. 

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the numbers properly. Let's consider layer 2. It starts at 8. 

First side (east): starts at 7 (end of layer 1) and moves east. Wait, if you start moving from the previous layer's end, then the first number on the side is the first step. Let me clarify:

To build layer 2, you start at the end of layer 1, which is 7. Then you move in the first direction (say, east) for two steps (m=2), placing numbers 8 and 9. Then turn to northeast and move two steps placing 10 and 11. Then turn to northwest and move two steps placing 12 and 13. Turn west: 14 and 15. Turn southwest: 16 and 17. Turn southeast: 18 and 19. Then you complete the layer with numbers 8-19, which is 12 numbers. 

Yes! So, each side is m steps (2 steps for layer 2), adding m numbers per side (not m+1). Then total numbers per layer is 6*m, which matches. The first number of the layer is the first number after the previous layer's end. Therefore, for layer 2, first number is 8. First side: two numbers 8,9. Second side: two numbers 10,11. Third side: 12,13. Fourth: 14,15. Fifth: 16,17. Sixth: 18,19. Total numbers: 2*6=12. Correct. So in this case, the corners are between the sides: for example, number 9 is at the end of first side and start of second side? No, because second side starts with 10. Wait, then how are the sides connected? 

If the first side ends at 9, then to start the second side, we turn direction and move in that direction. Therefore, the first number of second side is adjacent to 9. But how? If the second side is in a different direction, then the number after 9 would be 10, which is adjacent to 9 but not in the same direction. Therefore, the numbers on adjacent sides share a corner. So the first number of side 2 is adjacent to the last number of side 1. Therefore, in the example layer 2, the numbers go:

Side 1: 8,9

Side 2: 10,11

Side 3: 12,13

Side 4: 14,15

Side 5: 16,17

Side 6: 18,19

Total numbers from 8 to 19 (which is 12 numbers). But how do these numbers connect? For example, number 9 (end of side 1) is adjacent to 10 (first number of side 2). Therefore, the numbers on adjacent sides are adjacent. Similarly for 11 and 12, etc. 

Therefore, knowing this structure, for any number in the layer, we can determine whether it's in the middle of a side, a corner, or... 

Now, returning to our problem: 2026 is in layer m=26. In this layer, there are 6 sides, each with 26 numbers. The position within the layer is 75, which we calculated as 2*26 + 23 = 75. So, 75 = 26*2 + 23, meaning it's on the third side (since first two sides account for 26*2=52 numbers), and is the 23rd number on the third side. 

Wait, but each side has 26 numbers. So if the position within the layer is 75, and each side has 26 numbers:

- Side 1: positions 1 - 26

- Side 2: positions 27 - 52 (26 numbers)

- Side 3: positions 53 - 78 (26 numbers)

So 75 is on side 3, at position 75 - 52 = 23. So 23rd position on side 3. 

Now, the question is: what are the neighbors of this number?

In the hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. Depending on whether the cell is on a corner, on an edge, or in the middle. 

Since our number is on side 3, which has 26 numbers, and it's the 23rd number, which is near the end of side 3. If each side has 26 numbers, then positions 1-26 on the side. So 23rd is 3 positions before the end. Therefore, it's not a corner; the corners are the last number of each side and the first number of the next side. 

Therefore, the neighbors of the number in question will be:

- The number before it on side 3 (position 22 on side 3).

- The number after it on side 3 (position 24 on side 3).

- The number before it on the next side (side 4, but depends... need to figure out which neighbors are adjacent in the spiral).

But actually, in the hexagonal grid, each cell has neighbors in different directions. For a cell on side 3, not at the corner, its neighbors would be:

1. Previous number on the same side.

2. Next number on the same side.

3. A neighbor from the previous side, at the same position relative to the corner.

4. A neighbor from the next side, at the same position relative to the corner.

5. A neighbor from the inner layer (layer m-1).

6. A neighbor from the outer layer (layer m+1, if it exists).

Wait, maybe not. To figure this out, let's consider the position in the grid. 

Alternatively, consider that for any given number on a side of a layer, the neighbors are:

- The adjacent numbers on the same side.

- The numbers on the adjacent sides at the same offset from the corner.

- And numbers from the inner and outer layers at the same position.

But I need to verify this with a smaller example.

Take number 9, which is the last number of side 1 of layer 2. Its neighbors should be:

- 8 (previous on side 1), 

- 10 (first on side 2),

- A number on the previous layer (layer 1) adjacent to it,

- A number on the outer layer (layer 3) if it exists.

But in reality, according to the grid example, number 9 is adjacent to 2 and others. For example, from the given grid, number 9 is adjacent to 2, which is on layer 1. Also adjacent to 10 (on layer 2 side 2), and to 8 (on layer 2 side 1). There should be three more neighbors: one from the inner layer? Or from the same layer? 

This is getting complex. Let me try to look for a mathematical way to find the neighbors. 

Perhaps, considering that in each layer, the numbers on the same side increase by a certain amount. For example, on side k of layer m, moving along the side, each step increases by a fixed difference. 

If we can find that difference, then we can find previous and next numbers on the same side. Also, for the numbers on the adjacent sides, we can find their corresponding numbers based on position. And for the numbers from neighboring layers, we can calculate based on the position.

Let's try to define this.

First, for a given layer m, and side s (from 1 to 6), and position p on that side (from 1 to m), what is the number at that position? 

The first number on a side is T(m-1) + 1 + sum_{i=1}^{s-1} m_i, where m_i is the number of numbers on the previous sides. Since each side has m numbers, sum_{i=1}^{s-1} m = (s-1)*m. Therefore, the first number on side s of layer m is:

first(s, m) = T(m-1) + 1 + (s - 1)*m 

But T(m-1) = 1 + 3*(m-1)*m. 

Therefore, first(s, m) = 1 + 3*(m-1)*m + 1 + (s - 1)*m ?

Wait wait, no: the first number of layer m is T(m-1) + 1. Then the first number on side s is first_num_layer_m + (s - 1)*m 

Because each side has m numbers. 

So:

first(s, m) = T(m-1) + 1 + (s - 1)*m 

Therefore, the number at position p on side s of layer m is:

num(s, m, p) = first(s, m) + (p - 1)*d, where d is the step between consecutive numbers on the side.

Now, what is the step d? 

In other words, as you move along the side, how much does the number increase by each step? 

To figure out d, we can consider two consecutive numbers on the same side. For example, in layer 2, side 1: numbers 8, 9. So d = 1. Similarly, side 2 has numbers 10, 11, so d=1. 

Wait, but if all sides have the same step, then d=1. But that's only possible if numbers just increase by 1 as you spiral around. Which is the case here, since the spiral is sequential. Therefore, moving along the spiral, each next number is +1. Therefore, regardless of the side or layer, moving along the spiral path, the next number is current +1. 

However, if you move from one side to the next, there's a jump. For example, the end of side 1 (9) is adjacent to the start of side 2 (10), which is +1. So it's continuous. 

Therefore, in general, along the same side, consecutive numbers differ by 1. Therefore, for any position p on side s of layer m, the number is T(m-1) + 1 + (s - 1)*m + (p - 1). 

Because first(s, m) = T(m-1) + 1 + (s - 1)*m, then adding p - 1 gives the number at position p. 

Let me verify with layer 2, side 1, position 1: T(1) + 1 + (1 - 1)*2 = 7 + 1 + 0 = 8. Correct. Position 2: 8 + 1 = 9. Correct. For side 2, position 1: T(1) + 1 + (2 - 1)*2 = 7 + 1 + 2 = 10. Correct. Position 2: 10 + 1 = 11. Correct. 

Therefore, general formula: 

num(s, m, p) = 1 + 3*(m - 1)*m + 1 + (s - 1)*m + (p - 1) = 2 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + (p - 1). 

But to simplify, since T(m-1) = 1 + 3*(m - 1)*m, the first number on layer m is T(m - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3*(m - 1)*m + 1 = 2 + 3m(m - 1). Therefore, num(s, m, p) = [first number of layer m] + (s - 1)*m + (p - 1) = 2 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p - 1 = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p. 

Therefore:

num(s, m, p) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p.

Wait, let me recheck:

Yes, first number on layer m is T(m - 1) + 1 = [1 + 3(m - 1)m] + 1 = 2 + 3m(m - 1). Then, the first number on side s is first_num_layer_m + (s - 1)*m. Then, adding p - 1 gives the number at position p on the side. So total is 2 + 3m(m - 1) + (s - 1)*m + (p - 1) = 2 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p - 1 = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p. 

Yes. Therefore, the formula is:

num(s, m, p) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p.

Where s is 1 to 6, m is the layer number (starting at 1), p is position on the side from 1 to m.

Therefore, for our problem, we have m=26, s=3 (third side), p=23. 

Compute num(3, 26, 23):

First calculate 1 + 3m(m - 1) = 1 + 3*26*25 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951. Then add m(s - 1) = 26*(3 - 1) = 26*2 = 52. Then add p=23. Total: 1951 + 52 + 23 = 1951 + 75 = 2026. Correct! Perfect. 

Now, to find the neighbors of this number 2026 on the spiral. Let's recall that 2026 is on layer m=26, side s=3, position p=23. 

First, neighbors on the same side:

- Previous neighbor: position p-1 = 22. Number is num(3, 26, 22) = 2026 - 1 = 2025.

- Next neighbor: position p+1 = 24. Number is num(3, 26, 24) = 2026 + 1 = 2027.

But need to confirm whether p+1 is within the side. Since p=23 and m=26, p=24 is valid (since 24 ≤ 26). 

Next, neighbors from adjacent sides. For a number not at the corner of the side, there are two more neighbors: one from the previous side and one from the next side. 

The previous side is side s-1 = 2, and the next side is side s+1 = 4. 

However, since the position is p=23 on side s=3, the corresponding positions on the adjacent sides would be...? 

In the hexagonal grid, if you imagine a number on a side, not at the corner, it has neighbors from the adjacent sides at the same offset from the corner. 

For example, consider a number that's p-th position on side s. It's p steps from the start of the side. Therefore, on the previous side (side s-1), the corresponding neighbor would be at position p from the end of the side. Wait, let's think. 

Each side has m numbers. The corners are at position 1 and position m of the side. For a number not at the corner, say at position p (2 ≤ p ≤ m - 1), the neighbor from the previous side would be at position (m - p + 1) on side s-1? Or is there another pattern?

This is a bit abstract. Let me think with the example of layer 2. 

Take number 10 on layer 2, which is on side 2, position 1. Wait, number 10 is first on side 2. It is adjacent to 9 (last on side 1) and 11 (next on side 2). Also adjacent to...? According to the example grid, number 10 is adjacent to 3 and 14. 

If we consider number 10 on side 2 (northeast side) of layer 2, it's first position (p=1). How is it related to other sides? 

Perhaps for a number at position p on side s, there's a corresponding number at position p on side s+1, but offset? Not sure. Maybe it's better to consider the geometry. 

Alternatively, for a number inside a side (not at the corner), its neighbors on adjacent sides are the numbers that are p positions away from the adjacent corners. 

Wait, let's think in terms of distance from the corner. For our number on side s, position p: it's p steps from the start of the side, and (m - p) steps from the end of the side. 

Therefore, the neighbor from the previous side (side s-1) would be (m - p + 1) steps from the end of side s-1, which is the same as position (m - (m - p + 1) + 1) = p on side s-1? No, wait:

If the number is p steps from the start of side s, then maybe the corresponding neighbor on side s-1 is p steps from the end of side s-1. Since side s-1 has m numbers, p steps from the end would be position m - p + 1 on side s-1. 

Similarly, the neighbor on side s+1 would be p steps from the end of side s+1? Or from the start? 

This might need to be verified with an example. 

Take layer 2 again. Let's take number 10, which is on side 2, position 1 (since first number on side 2 is 10). For this number, p=1. Then, neighbor on previous side (side 1) would be p=1 steps from the end of side 1. Side 1 has m=2 numbers, so position m - p + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, position 2 on side 1 is 9, which is correct (number 9 is adjacent to number 10). 

Similarly, for the neighbor on the next side (side 3). The number on side s=2, position p=1. The corresponding neighbor on side s+1=3 would be p=1 steps from where? If following the same logic, it would be p steps from the start of the next side? Wait, or from the end? 

If we think of the number on side s at position p being adjacent to a number on side s+1 at position p from some end. Let's suppose that for the number on side s at position p, the neighbor on side s+1 is at position p from the start of side s+1. Let's check. 

For our example, number 10 on side 2, position p=1. If the neighbor on side s+1=3 is position p=1 on side 3. Side 3 of layer 2 is numbers 12, 13 (since first number on side 3 is 12 at position 1). But number 12 is adjacent to number 10? From the example grid, number 10 is adjacent to 3 and...? In the example given, 10 is on the top line "... 14 4 3 10...", so adjacent to 3, 4, and maybe others. 

Wait, maybe this approach isn't working. Perhaps I need a different strategy. 

Alternatively, for a number on side s, position p, the neighbors on adjacent sides are:

- From the previous side (s-1): position p from the end of that side.

- From the next side (s+1): position p from the beginning of that side.

Wait, for the example of number 10 (layer 2, side 2, position 1):

- From previous side (s-1 = 1), position p=1 from the end: side 1 has numbers 8,9. Position 1 from the end is position m=2, which is 9. Correct.

- From next side (s+1=3), position p=1 from the beginning: side 3 has numbers 12, 13. Position 1 is 12. Is 10 adjacent to 12? In the example grid, it's unclear, but in the spiral, moving from side 2 to side 3 is a turn, so the first number of side 3 is adjacent to the last number of side 2. The last number of side 2 is 11. Therefore, number 12 is adjacent to 11, not to 10. Therefore, this logic is incorrect. 

Therefore, need another approach. 

Perhaps each number on side s has neighbors from the adjacent sides at (p-1) or (p+1)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the numbers and the geometry of the spiral. Since the numbering increases by 1 along the spiral path, the numbers adjacent on the sides will differ by certain amounts based on the corners. 

Alternatively, think about what happens when you complete a side. Each side of the layer ends with a corner number, which is the starting number of the next side minus 1. For example, in layer 2, side 1 ends with 9, and side 2 starts with 10. Therefore, the corner between side 1 and 2 is 9 and 10. 

For a number on side s, position p (not a corner), its neighbors from adjacent sides are the numbers that are one step away from the corner. 

But how to translate this into numbers? 

Perhaps the neighbor from the previous side is (first(s-1, m) + m - p). Since first(s-1, m) + m is the end of side s-1 (which is the corner shared with side s). Then subtracting p would give a number p steps before that corner, which is the neighbor. 

Similarly, the neighbor from the next side is (first(s+1, m) + p - 1). Since first(s+1, m) is the start of side s+1, adding p-1 gives a number p-1 steps into the side, which would be adjacent. 

Let me check with our example. 

Take number 10 on layer 2, side 2, position 1.

First(s-1, m) = first(1, 2) = T(1) + 1 + (1 - 1)*2 = 7 + 1 + 0 = 8. Then first(s-1, m) + m - p = 8 + 2 - 1 = 9. Which is correct (neighbor is 9).

For the next side neighbor: first(s+1, m) = first(3, 2) = T(1) + 1 + (3 - 1)*2 = 7 + 1 + 4 = 12. Then first(s+1, m) + p - 1 = 12 + 1 - 1 = 12. But is 12 adjacent to 10? In the spiral structure, after side 2 ends at 11 (position 2), side 3 starts at 12, adjacent to 11. Therefore, 12 is adjacent to 11, not to 10. So this suggests that the neighbor from the next side is not 12. Therefore, this formula is incorrect. 

Maybe the formula for the next side should be first(s+1, m) + (m - p)? Let's try. 

In this example, first(s+1, m) + (m - p) = 12 + (2 - 1) = 13. Is 13 adjacent to 10? Probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe the neighbor from the next side is first(s, m) + ...? 

This approach is not working. Maybe I need to think differently. 

Let me consider the positions geometrically. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For a cell on a side of a layer, three of its neighbors are on the same layer: one previous, one next on the same side, and two on adjacent sides. Additionally, two neighbors from the inner and outer layers. Wait, but how?

Actually, no. For a cell on a side (not a corner), three neighbors are on the same layer, one from the inner layer, and two from the outer layer? Not sure. Let's think about layer 2 again. For number 10 (on layer 2), its neighbors would be:

- 9 (layer 2)

- 11 (layer 2)

- ... and numbers from layer 1 and 3?

Number 10 is on layer 2. Its neighbors would include:

- The previous number on side 2: 9 (layer 2).

- The next number on side 2: 11 (layer 2).

- A neighbor from the inner layer (layer 1). For example, if the spiral is moving around layer 1, maybe number 10 is adjacent to a number on layer 1.

- A neighbor from the outer layer (layer 3), if it exists.

But also two more neighbors: perhaps from the adjacent sides? 

Looking back at the example given, number 10 is shown in the top row as adjacent to 3 and 4. From the grid:

... 14  4  3  10 ...

So number 10 is adjacent to 3 and 4. Number 3 is on layer 1 (side 2). So how is that calculated? 

Perhaps there's a pattern where each number on side s of layer m is adjacent to a number on a certain side of the inner layer m-1 or outer layer m+1. 

Alternatively, let's think about the difference between numbers on adjacent layers. For example, moving radially outward or inward. 

If I can determine what number is directly "inner" to 2026 and what is directly "outer".

But to do this, I need to know how the numbers on adjacent layers relate. 

For any number on layer m, the number directly inward in the same radial direction would be in layer m-1. Similarly, outward in layer m+1. 

However, determining which number this is depends on the direction. 

Given that our number is on layer m=26, side s=3, position p=23, let's try to find the inward and outward numbers. 

To find the inward neighbor, we need to go from layer 26 to layer 25, along the same radial direction. Similarly for outward to layer 27.

But how to compute this. 

The number directly inward from our number would be the same position on layer m-1, but in which side? 

If we consider that the sides correspond to directions, then the same radial direction would correspond to the same side and position. But layers decrease by 1. 

Therefore, the inward neighbor would be at the same s, p on layer m-1. 

For example, if our number is at (s=3, p=23) on layer m=26, then inward neighbor is at (s=3, p=23) on layer m=25. Similarly, the outward neighbor is at (s=3, p=23) on layer m=27. 

Is this correct? Let's check with an example. Take layer 2, number 10 (side s=2, p=1). The inward neighbor would be (s=2, p=1) on layer 1. Layer 1 has numbers 2-7. The first number on side 2 of layer 1 is T(0) + 1 + (2 - 1)*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Therefore, inward neighbor is 3, which is correct (as per the grid, 10 is adjacent to 3). 

Similarly, the outward neighbor would be (s=2, p=1) on layer 3, which would be a number in layer 3. This seems plausible. 

Therefore, this suggests that for any number on (s, p) of layer m, the inward neighbor is num(s, m-1, p), and the outward neighbor is num(s, m+1, p). 

But we need to verify if this is valid for p within the range of the inner/outer layers. For example, p must be ≤ m-1 for inward neighbor (since layer m-1 has sides of length m-1). Similarly, for outward neighbor, since layer m+1 has sides of length m+1, p=23 ≤ m+1 (which is 27), which is true. 

Therefore, for our number (s=3, p=23) on layer m=26:

- Inward neighbor is num(3, 25, 23).

- Outward neighbor is num(3, 27, 23).

Additionally, the two neighbors from adjacent sides on the same layer:

- From the previous side (s=2), at a certain position.

- From the next side (s=4), at a certain position.

To find these, let's recall earlier suggestion that these correspond to p steps from ends. For example, for the previous side s-1, the number would be at position p from the end of s-1. Similarly for next side, p from the start of s+1? 

Let's use the earlier example: number 10 (layer 2, s=2, p=1). Previous side is s=1, p from end is 1. Side s=1 has m=2, so position from end is 1 = position 2 (end of side). Which corresponds to number 9, which is correct. 

Next side is s=3, p from start of s+1. If p=1 from start of s+1, it's number 12, but as discussed earlier, number 12 is adjacent to 11, not to 10. However, if we consider p from the end of s+1, let's see. For s+1=3 on layer 2, position from end is... if p=1, then end of side is position 2, position from end is 2 - p + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2. But position 2 on side 3 is 13. Not adjacent to 10. So this isn't working. 

Wait, but the number on the previous side is adjacent, but not the next. Why?

Maybe because moving from one side to another, the adjacent number is at a different p. For example, for a number at position p on side s, the neighbor from the previous side is as calculated, and the neighbor from the next side is at position p from the previous side? Or another relation?

Alternatively, think about the corners. Each side s has two corners: at p=1 (start) and p=m (end). The number at position p on side s is between the corners at p and p+1. The number from the next side is located m - p + 1 on that side?

This is getting too vague. Let's think back to the formula for num(s, m, p). If we can find the numbers that differ by certain amounts to be the neighbors. 

For example, since numbers increase by 1 along the spiral path, the neighbors can be found by determining how many steps away they are in the spiral. 

However, this requires knowing the order of numbers in the spiral. 

Let me try to derive the sequence. For a general layer m, with 6 sides each m numbers. The first number on side s is:

first(s, m) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + 1. Wait no, earlier formula is:

num(s, m, p) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p. 

Therefore, for a given side s, the numbers increase as p increases. 

Now, the number at (s, m, p) has:

- Prev on side: (s, m, p-1) = num - 1

- Next on side: (s, m, p+1) = num + 1

- Inward: (s, m-1, p) = ?

- Outward: (s, m+1, p) = ?

- And two more neighbors: let's denote them as N1 and N2 from adjacent sides.

To find N1 and N2, we need to figure out their positions. 

Let me take our example of number 10 on layer 2, side s=2, p=1. We know its neighbors are 9 (prev), 11 (next), 3 (inward), and ??? (outward). Also two more neighbors. From the grid, number 10 is adjacent to 4 and 14. Let's check:

If inward is 3, then maybe one of the other neighbors is 4 (from layer 1) and 14 (from layer 2 or 3). If I can find a pattern.

Looking at the formula, maybe these neighbors correspond to (s-1, m, p) or some transformation. 

Wait, another thought: each side s has a "mirror" side in the opposite direction, s+3 (mod 6). For example, side 1 has opposite side 4. If a number is on side s, then moving inward, it might be adjacent to a number on side s of layer m-1, and outward on side s of layer m+1. Additionally, it might be adjacent to numbers on sides s-1 and s+1 of the same layer, but at a different position. 

But how to find those positions. 

Alternatively, for the number at (s, m, p), one of the other neighbors is the number at (s, m, p) - m - 1, and another is (s, m, p) + m + 1? Or something like that. 

Let me test with number 10. In layer 2, m=2, so m + 1 = 3. If I subtract 3, 10 - 3 = 7, but 7 is on layer 1. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the difference between numbers across the corners. For example, moving from the end of one side to the start of the next side is +1. The end of side s is at (s, m, m). The start of side s+1 is (s+1, m, 1) = (s, m, m) + 1. 

For a number not at the end of the side, how much would it differ from a number on the adjacent side? 

Let me think about the relationship between position p on side s and position on side s+1. Suppose we have a number at position p on side s. If we move to the same relative position on side s+1, what number would that be? 

The first number on side s+1 is first(s+1, m) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m((s+1) - 1) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) + ms. 

Whereas the number on side s, position p is 1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p = [1 + 3m(m - 1)] + m(s - 1) + p.

So the difference between first(s+1, m) and our number is: [1 + 3m(m - 1) + ms] - [1 + 3m(m - 1) + m(s - 1) + p] = ms - m(s - 1) - p = m - p.

Therefore, first(s+1, m) = our number + (m - p).

Therefore, the number at position p on side s+1 is first(s+1, m) + (position - 1) = [our number + (m - p)] + (position - 1). 

But what position on side s+1 corresponds to our desired neighbor? 

If our number is on side s at position p, then its "corresponding" number on side s+1 is such that they are diagonally adjacent in the hexagonal grid. This might be at position m - p + 1 on side s+1? Or some other position. 

But from the above difference
