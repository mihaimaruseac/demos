<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid. Let me start by understanding how the spiral is structured. 

First, from the given example, it looks like numbers are arranged in a spiral going outward. In the hexagonal grid, each layer or ring around the center (which is 1) adds more numbers. The example shows the numbers increasing as they spiral outward. Let me visualize the spiral:

Starting at the center with 1, then moving outward in a hexagonal pattern. Each ring around the center should have more numbers. For a hexagonal grid, each ring n has 6*n numbers. Wait, let me check that. 

In a square spiral, each ring adds 8 more numbers each time, but for hexagonal... Hmm, let me think. In a hexagonal grid, each ring (layer) should be a hexagon. The number of numbers in each ring is 6*(n-1) for the nth ring? Wait, let me verify with the numbers given.

Looking at the example given:

The center is 1 (first number). The next ring around would be numbers from 2 to 7. Wait, how many numbers are in the first ring? Let me see.

In the example, the numbers around the center (which is 1) are starting from 2, then going to... Hmm, the given snippet shows numbers like 14, 4, 3, 10... Maybe I need to figure out the pattern of how numbers are arranged.

Alternatively, maybe I need to recall that in a hexagonal grid, the numbers in each ring can be calculated. For example, the first ring (ring 1) has 6 numbers, ring 2 has 12 numbers, ring 3 has 18 numbers, and so on. Wait, but in the square grid, the nth ring has 8n numbers? Wait, but in the square spiral, starting from 1, the first ring (around 1) is numbers 2-9, which is 8 numbers, the next ring 10-25 is 16 numbers... So 8n where n is ring number. But for the hexagon, maybe the formula is different.

But maybe here, the rings are defined such that each ring k has 6*k numbers. So ring 1 (the first ring around the center) has 6*1=6 numbers. Then ring 2 has 6*2=12 numbers, ring 3 has 18 numbers, etc. So if the center is considered ring 0, which has 1 number. Then total numbers up to ring n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). Let me check this formula with the example.

For example, ring 1 (n=1) gives total numbers as 1 + 3*1*2=7 numbers. So the numbers up to ring 1 are 7. Which is 1 (center) plus 6 numbers around it. That matches. Then ring 2 (n=2) gives 1 + 3*2*3=19 numbers. So numbers up to ring 2 are 19, meaning ring 2 adds 19 - 7 = 12 numbers. Which is 6*2. That seems to check out. So yes, the formula for total numbers up to ring k is 1 + 3k(k + 1). 

So given that, if we have a number, say, 2026, we can figure out which ring it's in. First, find the ring k such that 1 + 3k(k + 1) is just greater than 2026. Then 2026 is in ring k. Wait, but actually, the total numbers up to ring (k-1) is less than 2026, and total numbers up to ring k is greater. So first step is to find k.

Let me formalize this.

Define total numbers up to ring k: T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1). So we need to find k such that T(k-1) < 2026 ≤ T(k).

Let me set up the equation 1 + 3k(k + 1) ≥ 2026.

So solving 3k^2 + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026.

Which simplifies to 3k^2 + 3k ≥ 2025

Divide both sides by 3: k^2 + k ≥ 675

Solving k^2 + k - 675 ≥ 0.

Using quadratic formula: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*675)] / 2

sqrt(1 + 2700) = sqrt(2701). Let me approximate sqrt(2701). Since 52^2 = 2704, so sqrt(2701) ≈ 52 - (2704 - 2701)/(2*52) = 52 - 3/(104) ≈ 51.971. So k ≈ [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.48. So the positive root is approx 25.48. So k must be 26. Therefore, ring k is 26? Wait, but need to check T(25) and T(26). Let's check:

Compute T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1). 

For k=25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951.

For k=26: 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107.

So 2026 is between T(25)=1951 and T(26)=2107. Therefore, 2026 is in ring 26. The numbers in ring 26 start from T(25) + 1 = 1952 up to T(26) = 2107.

Therefore, the position of 2026 is in ring 26. Now, we need to figure out where exactly in that ring it is. Since each ring has 6*k numbers, which for ring 26 is 6*26 = 156 numbers.

So starting from 1952, going up to 1952 + 155 = 2107. So the difference between 2026 and the start of the ring (1952) is 2026 - 1952 = 74. So 2026 is the 75th number in the ring 26 (since we count starting at 1). Wait, 1952 is the first number, so 1952 is position 1, then 1953 is 2,... up to 2107 which is 156th. Therefore, 2026 is position (2026 - 1952 + 1) = 75th position? Wait no, 1952 is position 1. So 2026 - 1952 = 74. So 2026 is the (74 + 1) = 75th number in the ring. Wait, if it's the 75th number in ring 26.

Since each ring is divided into 6 segments (sides of the hexagon), each segment has 6k / 6 = k numbers. Wait, for ring k, each side of the hexagon has k numbers? Wait, no. Wait, each ring has 6k numbers. So each side (there are 6 sides) of the hexagon will have k numbers per side. For example, in ring 1, there are 6 numbers, each side has 1 number. For ring 2, each side has 2 numbers, total 6*2=12. So for ring 26, each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, the 75th number in the ring corresponds to which side? 

Since each side has 26 numbers, 75 divided by 26. Let me divide 75 by 26. 26*2=52, 26*3=78. So 75 is 2 full sides (52 numbers) and 75 - 52 = 23rd number on the third side. Therefore, the position is on the third side of the ring, 23rd position from the start of that side. 

Now, to figure out the neighbors of 2026, I need to know where exactly it is located. But in order to find its neighbors, I need to understand how the numbers progress along each side. Let me think about how numbers progress in each ring.

In a hexagonal spiral, moving from one ring to another. Let me think of how numbers are arranged. For example, let me look at the given numbers:

The example shows:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Looking at this, maybe the spiral goes clockwise? Let me try to reconstruct the numbers. Starting from the center 1, then moving right to 2, then... Hmm, but without seeing the full spiral it's a bit hard. However, maybe we can think in terms of directions.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. When moving outward in a spiral, the numbers increase as you move in specific directions. However, the exact path might vary based on the spiral's design. However, perhaps there is a standard way to generate the hexagonal spiral.

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the numbers on each side of the ring. Let me think.

Each ring is built by moving along six directions. Let me consider that for each ring, starting from the end of the previous ring, you move outward. For example, in square spirals, each ring is built by moving east, north, west, south, etc., but for hexagonal spirals, it's more complex.

Alternatively, since each ring is a hexagon, each side of the ring can be considered as a sequence where each number on the side can be expressed in terms of the ring number. 

For example, the starting number of each ring. The starting number of ring k is T(k-1) + 1. For example, ring 1 starts at T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, earlier we had T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1). Therefore, ring k has numbers from T(k-1) + 1 to T(k). For example, ring 1 is from T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 to T(1) = 1 + 3(1)(2) = 7. Wait 1 + 3*1*2 = 7? Wait 3*1*2=6, plus 1 is 7. But 1 is the center. So numbers in ring 1 are from 2 to 7, which is 6 numbers, correct. Then ring 2 is from T(1)+1 = 7 + 1 = 8 to T(2) = 1 + 3*2*3 = 19. Wait T(2) is 1 + 18 = 19? Wait 3*2*3 is 18. So numbers from 8 to 19, which is 12 numbers. Correct. So for ring k, the starting number is T(k-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3(k-1)k? Wait no:

Wait T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1). Therefore, T(k - 1) = 1 + 3(k - 1)k. Therefore, starting number of ring k is T(k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). But maybe it's easier to think of starting number S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). For example, for k=1, S(1) = 2 + 3(1)(0) = 2, which is correct. For k=2, S(2)=2 + 3*2*1=8, correct as above.

But how about the numbers along each side of the ring. Let me consider that for ring k, each side has numbers increasing by some step. For example, each side might be an arithmetic sequence.

In a square spiral, each side of the ring increases by a certain amount, but in hexagonal... Let me think. If you imagine starting at the beginning of a ring, moving along one side. Maybe the numbers on each side of the ring can be calculated based on the previous ring's end.

Alternatively, let me look for patterns or formulas. Maybe there is a formula for the numbers at the corners of each ring. In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has six corners. For example, the last number of the previous ring is located at a corner of the current ring. Wait, for example, the last number of ring k is T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1). Maybe that number is located at one of the corners of ring k+1?

Alternatively, perhaps each corner of a ring k is a number given by some formula. For example, for ring k, the first corner (starting position) is S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1. Then, moving along a side of length k numbers, each step increases by some amount.

Wait, perhaps the numbers on the side can be modeled as follows: Let's say you start at S(k). Then moving along the side, each step adds some increment. For example, in a square spiral, each side of the ring increases by 2*(ring number). But in a hexagonal spiral... Hmm.

Alternatively, if we look at the difference between numbers on the same side. Let me take an example.

Looking at ring 1, numbers from 2 to 7. Let me suppose the first side starts at 2, then the next numbers? In the given example, the numbers 2 is adjacent to 1, which is the center. Let me try to reconstruct the numbers.

But maybe another approach. Since each ring is a hexagon, there are six "arms" or "sides". The numbers on each side can be considered as a linear sequence. Let me think about how numbers increase along a side. For example, moving along a side of ring k, each number increases by (some value). Maybe the difference between consecutive numbers on a side is 6k? Or something else?

Alternatively, maybe if I can figure out the formula for the numbers on a side. Let me consider ring k. The starting number of the ring is S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1? Wait:

Earlier, T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1). Therefore, T(k - 1) = 1 + 3(k - 1)k. So starting number of ring k is S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). For example, ring 2 has S(2) = 2 + 3*2*1 = 8, correct. 

Now, the first side of ring k would go from S(k) to S(k) + something. Each side has k numbers. But since there are six sides, each with k numbers, total of 6k numbers in ring k.

If we consider moving along a side, how much does the number increase each step? Let me take ring 2 as example. Ring 2 numbers from 8 to 19 (T(2) = 19). Each side has 2 numbers. So first side: 8, x. Second side: x+..., etc. Hmm, but how?

Alternatively, think of corners. Each side starts at a corner. The first number of the ring S(k) is a corner. Then moving along that side, when you reach the next corner, you turn 60 degrees. The numbers on the sides might increase in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of each corner number. For ring k, each corner is a number that is a certain distance from the center.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number in each ring is T(k). For example, T(1)=7, T(2)=19, T(3)= 1 + 3*3*4= 1 + 36=37. So for ring k, the maximum number is T(k). For ring 2, maximum is 19, which is 8 + 6*2 + 3*2? Not sure. Maybe think about the numbers on the six corners of ring k. For example, for ring 1, the corners are 7? Wait, the maximum is 7. How many corners? Six. But ring 1 has 6 numbers. So each corner is one number. For example, maybe the numbers on the corners are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... Wait, no. Wait in the given example, there's numbers like 14, 4, 3, 10... Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a pattern in the corners. Let me check for ring 1 (k=1). The numbers are 2-7. The corners would be at the ends of each side. For example, if each side has 1 number (since k=1), then each number is a corner. Therefore, the six corners of ring 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

For ring 2 (k=2), numbers from 8 to 19. Each side has 2 numbers. Therefore, there are 6 sides, each with 2 numbers. The corners would be the starting number of each side. The first side starts at 8, then the next side starts at 8 + 2 = 10? Wait, not sure. Let me think. Each side has k numbers, so for ring 2, each side has 2 numbers. Therefore, moving from one corner to the next requires moving 2 numbers. Therefore, the starting number of each side is separated by some step. But what?

If each corner is separated by a certain step. For example, moving from the end of one side to the start of the next side is a new corner. The difference between adjacent corners would be the length of the side. 

But how does the numbers progress? Maybe adjacent corners differ by something. For example, in ring k, going from one corner to the next, the number increases by something. 

Alternatively, think about how the number at the end of one side relates to the start of the next. For example, for ring 1, starting at S(1)=2. Each side has 1 number. Moving to next side, the next corner is 2 + steps? 

Alternatively, if we think of adjacent rings. The last number of ring k-1 is T(k-1). Then the first number of ring k is T(k-1) + 1. So for example, the last number of ring 1 is 7, first of ring 2 is 8. So moving from ring 1's last corner (7) to ring 2's first corner (8) is +1. Then moving along ring 2's first side, which has 2 numbers: 8, 9. Then next corner is 9 + something?

Wait, if there are six sides in ring 2, each side has two numbers, starting at 8. Let me try to figure out the numbers on the sides of ring 2. 

Let me think. In the example given, there's a part of the spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Looking at this, the number 1 is in the center. Then around it, numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Wait, in the example, 2 and 9 are mentioned. Maybe the spiral is going in a clockwise direction, moving outward.

Assuming that, then after the center 1, moving to the right is 2, then up-right is 3, then up-left is 4, then left is 5, then down-left is 6, then down-right is 7, then right again is 8? Wait not sure. Maybe need to reconstruct.

But perhaps the key is to figure out the formula for numbers along a side. Let me try.

In general, for a given ring k, and a particular side m (from 1 to 6), the numbers on that side can be represented as:

Starting number: S(k) + (m - 1)*(k)

Because each side has k numbers, so each new side starts k numbers ahead. Wait, but S(k) is the starting number of ring k. So first side: starts at S(k), then second side starts after the first side (which has k numbers). Therefore the starting number of side m is S(k) + (m - 1)*k. However, that might not account for the direction. Wait, for example, in ring 2 (k=2), the first side starts at 8. Then next side starts at 8 + 2 = 10? Then next side at 12, then 14, then 16, then 18, then the sixth side would start at 20? But ring 2 ends at 19. Which is a problem. 19 < 20. Therefore, this approach is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting number of each side is S(k) + (m - 1)*(k - 1). Let me test for ring 2. If k=2, then starting number of each side is S(2) + (m - 1)*(2 -1) = 8 + (m-1)*1. So first side starts at 8, second at 9, third at 10, etc. But each side has k=2 numbers. So first side: 8, 8 + 1 = 9. Then second side: 9, 9 + 1 = 10. Third side: 10, 10 + 1 = 11. Fourth side: 11, 12. Fifth side: 12, 13. Sixth side: 13, 14. Then total numbers would be 2*6=12 numbers, from 8 to 19. Wait, but according to this, ends at 14, but T(2)=19. So discrepancy here. Therefore, this approach is also wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers on each side of the ring increase by a certain amount. Maybe the difference depends on the side. Let me think again.

Let me think of how numbers progress in the spiral. Let me consider the transition between rings. The last number of ring k-1 is T(k - 1). Then the first number of ring k is T(k - 1) + 1. Then moving along the first side of ring k, which has k numbers. So the first k numbers are T(k - 1) + 1, T(k - 1) + 2,... up to T(k - 1) + k. Wait, but then the next side would start at T(k - 1) + k + 1? But if each side has k numbers, then total numbers per ring would be 6*k. But if we do that, then the last number of ring k would be T(k - 1) + 6*k. However, T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1). But T(k - 1) + 6k = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 6k = 1 + 3k^2 - 3k + 6k = 1 + 3k^2 + 3k = 1 + 3k(k + 1) = T(k). So that works!

Ah! Therefore, each side of the ring is an arithmetic sequence with difference 1. Therefore, starting from S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1, each side has k consecutive numbers, and then the next side starts with the next number. Therefore, for example, in ring 2, starting at 8 (which is T(1) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8), then the first side has numbers 8, 9; next side 10, 11; then 12, 13; then 14, 15; then 16, 17; then 18, 19. So total 12 numbers. Which matches T(2)=1 + 3*2*3=19. Perfect! So this is the key. Therefore, each side of the ring has consecutive numbers, increasing by 1 each step, and each side has k numbers. Therefore, for ring k, each side is consecutive numbers of length k, starting from S(k) + (side - 1)*k.

Wait let me formalize:

For ring number k, starting number S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1? Wait no:

Earlier we said that T(k - 1) = 1 + 3(k - 1)k. Therefore S(k) = T(k - 1) + 1. Therefore S(k) = 1 + 3(k - 1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). 

But then the numbers on the first side of ring k are from S(k) to S(k) + k - 1. Then second side from S(k) + k to S(k) + 2k - 1, etc., until the sixth side from S(k) + 5k to S(k) + 6k - 1 = T(k - 1) + 6k = T(k). Which confirms.

Therefore, knowing that, for any given number in ring k, we can find which side it is on and its position on that side.

Earlier, for our problem, the number 2026 is in ring k=26, position in ring: 75th number. Since each side has k=26 numbers, 75 divided by 26 gives quotient 2 and remainder 75 - 2*26 = 75 - 52 = 23. Therefore, it is on the (2 + 1) = third side? Wait:

Wait, if each side has 26 numbers, then the first side is positions 1-26 in the ring, second side 27-52, third side 53-78, fourth side 79-104, fifth side 105-130, sixth side 131-156. 

Wait, since 2026 is the 75th number in the ring. So 75 is between 53 and 78, which is the third side (positions 53-78). So that's the third side. And 75 - 52 = 23. Therefore, the 23rd position on the third side. 

Therefore, to find the value of 2026, we can calculate what is the starting number of the third side in ring 26, and then add 23 - 1 = 22 to get the 23rd number.

The starting number of the first side in ring 26 is S(26) = T(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952. Then the starting number of the third side is S(26) + 2*26 = 1952 + 52 = 2004. Therefore, the third side starts at 2004. The first number is 2004, then next is 2005,... up to 2004 + 25 = 2029 (since 26 numbers on the side). 

Therefore, the 23rd number on the third side is 2004 + 22 = 2026. Which matches our number. Great, so that confirms that 2026 is located on the third side of ring 26, at position 23. Therefore, now we need to find the six neighbors of this number.

But how to find the neighbors? In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. Depending on the direction we are moving in the spiral, the positions of the neighbors will change. 

To find the neighbors, we need to know where exactly the number is located. Since we know which side it is on and its position, perhaps we can figure out the relative positions.

But perhaps there's another way. Since we know that the numbers on the spiral follow a certain pattern, maybe we can find formulas for the neighbors.

Alternatively, maybe think about coordinates. If we can model the hexagonal grid with coordinates, assign coordinates to each number, then calculate the neighbors. However, that might be complicated. 

Alternatively, since we know how the numbers progress along the sides, we can figure out the neighbors based on their positions relative to 2026's position. 

Let me think. Since 2026 is on the third side of ring 26. Each side is a straight line in the hexagonal grid. The neighbors would be in different directions: along the same side, previous side, next side, or inner and outer rings. 

First, let me recall that in a hexagonal spiral, moving along the sides, the direction changes each time a corner is reached. The neighbors of a number on a side would include:

- The previous number on the same side (if any),

- The next number on the same side (if any),

- One number on the previous side,

- One number on the next side,

- And two numbers from the previous ring (inner ring) and next ring (outer ring)? Or maybe different.

Alternatively, perhaps the six neighbors are:

- Two adjacent numbers on the same side,

- Two adjacent numbers on the adjacent sides,

- And two numbers from the adjacent rings?

But need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of directions. In a hexagonal grid, moving along the third side of ring 26. Let me consider that each side is oriented in a particular direction. The six directions in a hexagonal grid can be modeled with axial coordinates, but maybe that's too abstract.

Alternatively, since we know how the numbers increase, maybe we can find the neighbors by knowing if they are on the same or different sides or rings.

Let me think about the neighbors. For a number on a side of a ring, there are neighbors:

1. The number before it on the same side (if not at the start),

2. The number after it on the same side (if not at the end),

3. The number before it on the previous side (if not at the start of its side),

4. The number before it on the next side (if not at the end of its side),

Wait, not sure. Maybe another way. Alternatively, each corner connects three numbers. 

But perhaps we need to consider that each number on a side is part of a hexagon, so it's surrounded by six numbers. For a number in the middle of a side (not at the corner), its neighbors would be:

- The adjacent numbers on the same side (left and right),

- Two numbers on the previous and next side (probably the ones adjacent diagonally),

- And the numbers from the previous and next ring (inner and outer)?

But how?

Alternatively, maybe to find neighbors, think about how the spiral is built.

Since we know 2026 is on the third side of ring 26, position 23. Let me denote the side as side m = 3 (third side). Let me try to visualize. Each side of the hexagon can be thought of as moving in a certain direction. Suppose we are on side 3 of ring 26. Let me assume directions for each side:

But maybe it's complex. Alternatively, perhaps look for the neighbors based on number values. Since numbers are arranged in the spiral, neighbors might be numbers close to 2026 in value, but not necessarily.

Alternatively, think of the corners. For example, the corners of ring 26 are located at the start of each side. The starting numbers of the six sides of ring 26 are:

Side 1: 1952, 

Side 2: 1952 + 26 = 1978,

Side 3: 1978 + 26 = 2004,

Side 4: 2004 + 26 = 2030,

Side 5: 2030 + 26 = 2056,

Side 6: 2056 + 26 = 2082.

Wait, the sixth side would end at 2082 + 25 = 2107 (since 26 numbers). 

Wait, our number 2026 is on the third side, starting at 2004, so the end of the third side is 2004 + 25 = 2029.

Therefore, the corners of ring 26 (start of each side) are 1952, 1978, 2004, 2030, 2056, 2082. So our number 2026 is on the third side, between the corner at 2004 and the next corner at 2030. Since it's at position 23, as we said, and the third side has 26 numbers, so it's 23 numbers from the start of the side, which is 3 numbers before the end of the side (26 - 23 = 3). So the distance from the end is 3, meaning it's not near a corner. Therefore, it's in the middle of the side. Therefore, the neighbors on the same side are 2026 -1 = 2025 and 2026 + 1 = 2027. 

Now, besides those, we need to find the other four neighbors. Those would come from adjacent sides and maybe previous/next ring.

Let me think. Since we are on the third side, the adjacent sides are second and fourth. On the side before (second) and after (fourth). 

Given the position on the third side, since it's not at a corner, it would have a neighbor on the previous side and the next side. How to calculate their values?

In a hexagonal grid, when you're on a side, the adjacent sides meet at the corners. So if you are in the middle of side m, your neighbors from adjacent sides would be...? Let me think with an example.

Take a simple case: ring 2, third side. Let's say we are somewhere in the third side. For example, take the number 12 on third side of ring 2 (which starts at 12, since side 1 starts at 8, side 2 at 10, side 3 at 12, with numbers 12 and 13). Wait in ring 2, third side is numbers 12, 13. Suppose we take 12 (position 1 on the third side). The neighbors would be?

But maybe it's complex. Alternatively, think about the following. When moving along a side, each number is adjacent to two numbers on the same side, and adjacent to numbers from other sides.

Perhaps there is a formula. 

Let me think of the numbers adjacent from the previous side. For example, if we are at position p on side m (not at the end), then there is a number on side m-1 that is adjacent diagonally. Similarly, a number on side m+1 that is adjacent diagonally. 

How to find those numbers? Let me think. For example, suppose we are on side m at position p (1 ≤ p ≤ k, where k is the ring number). The number is N = starting_number_side_m + p - 1.

What is the starting number of side m? It is S(k) + (m - 1)*k = T(k - 1) + 1 + (m - 1)*k.

But for our case, k=26, m=3, starting number of side is 2004.

Suppose we have a number at position p=23 on side m=3. How to find neighbors on adjacent sides?

Perhaps the neighbor from the previous side (m-1=2) is the number that is p steps from the end of side m-1? 

Wait, for example, in ring k, each side has k numbers. Suppose we are on side m, position p. The neighbor from the previous side (side m-1) would be the number at position (k - p + 1) on side m - 1? 

Let me think with a small example. Take ring 2, k=2, side m=2, position p=1. The number is 10. What is the neighbor from side m-1=1? Let's see. The previous side (side 1) has numbers 8,9. The neighbor of 10 should be... If we are at the start of side 2, moving to side 3, maybe the neighbor is the last number of side 1? Which is 9. But 9 is adjacent to 10? In the given example, numbers like 2 and 9 are adjacent. Wait the example showed 1 adjacent to 2 and 9, so maybe yes. If 9 is adjacent to 10. So for p=1 on side m=2, neighbor on previous side is last number of side m-1=1, which is 9. Which is starting_number_side_1 + k - 1 = 8 + 2 - 1 = 9. So in general, for position p on side m, the neighbor from the previous side is starting_number_side_{m-1} + k - p. Wait let me check:

In ring 2, for position p=1 on side m=2, the neighbor is 8 + 2 - 1 = 9. Correct. Similarly, suppose position p=2 on side m=2: the number is 11. What's the neighbor from side m-1=1? It should be starting_number_side_{m-1} + k - p = 8 + 2 - 2 = 8. Is 8 adjacent to 11? In ring 2, side 2 is 10,11. The neighbors of 11 would include 10 (on same side), 12 (on side 3), and some others. Maybe 8 is not adjacent? Wait perhaps this formula is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the neighbor from previous side is starting_number_side_{m-1} + p. For position p on side m, the neighbor on previous side is starting_number_side_{m-1} + p. In the example, for p=1 on side m=2, neighbor would be 8 + 1 = 9. Correct. For p=2 on side m=2, neighbor would be 8 + 2 = 10. But 10 is on side m=2. Not sure. Wait 10 is the first number of side m=2. The neighbor of 11 from side m-1 might be different. 

Alternatively, perhaps when moving along the side, the "diagonal" neighbor from the previous side is the number that is diagonally adjacent. For example, if we imagine walking along the side, the previous side is connected at one end. Maybe the neighbor is the number that is one step before the start of the current side on the previous side? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about coordinates. Suppose we model the hexagonal grid with axial coordinates (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0. But perhaps axial coordinates can be simplified to two coordinates.

Alternatively, consider that each ring k has numbers arranged in such a way that each side corresponds to moving in a particular direction. For example, starting from the corner, moving along a direction for k steps.

However, without a concrete coordinate system, maybe I need another approach.

Let me try to think about the numbers that are neighbors of 2026. Since it is on the third side of ring 26, position 23. The neighbors are:

1. Previous on same side: 2025.

2. Next on same side: 2027.

Then, we need four more neighbors. Let me think about the other directions. 

Perhaps there are neighbors from the previous ring (ring 25) and from the next ring (ring 27). Wait, but 2026 is on ring 26. So inner ring is 25, outer ring is 27.

But how to find numbers in adjacent rings? For example, depending on the direction. If the number is on a side going outward, maybe there's an inner and outer number. 

Alternatively, considering that each number on a side has two neighbors that are one ring inward and two that are one ring outward? 

Alternatively, consider that in a hexagonal spiral, numbers adjacent to a given number can be found by looking at numbers that are adjacent in the spiral's construction. However, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, recall that in a square spiral, the neighbors can be found by looking at numbers with specific relations based on their positions in the rings. Maybe similar here.

Alternatively, think of the corners. For example, the corners of ring 26 are at numbers 1952, 1978, 2004, 2030, 2056, 2082. Our number 2026 is between 2004 (the start of side 3) and 2030 (the start of side 4). 

Since 2026 is not at a corner, its neighbors from adjacent sides will be numbers that are adjacent in the grid. 

Perhaps if we consider that when you are on a side, the numbers adjacent to it from the neighboring sides are offset by certain amounts. For example, on the third side, at position p, moving towards the end of the side, you approach the corner at 2030, which is the start of side 4. The number before the corner on side 3 is 2029. The corner number is 2030. The first number on side 4 is 2030, and its neighbor would be 2031. 

But how is 2026 connected? Maybe the neighbors on the adjacent sides are related to the corners of the previous and next sides. 

Another idea: in a hexagonal spiral, each number on a side is at distance k from the previous ring. For example, moving along a side from the previous ring's corner, each step increases by 1. Therefore, the number on position p on side m of ring k is located at a certain distance from the inner ring.

But to find the neighbors, perhaps we need to calculate the numbers that are diagonally adjacent. 

Alternatively, since we know the positions, maybe we can calculate the "offsets". For example, the number on the previous ring (ring 25) that is adjacent to our number. To find that, maybe we can go back along the direction opposite to the current side. 

But this is vague. Maybe we need a formula.

Alternatively, note that each side of a ring connects two corners. The corners of ring k are spaced 6k apart? No, as we saw earlier, the corners are spaced k apart? Wait, for ring 2, the corners are spaced by 2 (starting numbers 8,10,12,14,16,18,...). But the numbers increase by 2 each time. However, the numbers on the sides increase by 1 each step. Therefore, the corners are numbers that are at the start of each side. 

The difference between consecutive corners is k. For example, in ring k=2, difference between corner 1 (start of side 1:8) and corner 2 (start of side 2:10) is 2 = k. Similarly for the rest. Therefore, the difference between consecutive corners on the same ring is k.

Now, for a number located on a side between two corners, say corner A and corner B, with difference of k. The position p along the side from corner A (1 ≤ p ≤ k). 

The number is A + p - 1. 

Now, in the hexagonal grid, the neighbors not on the same side would be:

- One from the previous side (connected to corner A),

- One from the next side (connected to corner B),

- Two from the inner ring,

- One from the outer ring?

But I need to think how these correspond to numbers.

Alternatively, consider that each corner on ring k connects to three numbers:

- The end of one side (previous),

- The start of the current side,

- The start of the next side.

But how about for a non-corner number?

Let me try to find the neighbors of our number, which is on side 3 of ring 26, position 23, value 2026.

First, neighbors on the same side: 2025 and 2027.

Next, neighbors on adjacent sides.

Since it's on side 3 between corners A=2004 (start of side 3) and B=2030 (start of side 4). The number is 2026 is A + 22 (since A = 2004, 2004 + 22 = 2026). Since the difference between corners A and B is 26 (k=26). Therefore, our position is 22 steps from A, which means 26 - 22 - 1 = 3 steps before B. So it's closer to A than to B.

Now, the neighbors on the adjacent sides. For example, imagine standing on the number 2026 on side 3, facing towards side 4 (the direction of increasing numbers on the side). The left neighbor would be on side 2, and the right neighbor would be on side 4. 

To find the value of the neighbor on side 2. Since our number is 22 steps from corner A on side 3, then the neighbor on side 2 would be 22 steps from the previous corner towards side 3? Wait.

The corner before A is corner C = 1978 (start of side 2). The corner A is 2004. The difference between C and A is k = 26. So 2004 - 1978 = 26. Therefore, the number on side 2 that is adjacent to our number on side 3 would be located 22 steps from corner C towards the next corner. But since side 2 has 26 numbers, from 1978 to 1978 + 25 = 2003. Therefore, the number on side 2 would be C + 22 = 1978 + 22 = 2000. 

Similarly, the neighbor on the adjacent side 4 would be located how? Since we're 23 steps from the start of side 3, and the side 4 starts at B=2030. The neighbor on side 4 would be located offset by how much? Maybe since we are 23 steps into side 3, the neighbor on side 4 is at position -1? Not sure. Wait, if at the end of side 3 is 2029 (which is 26th number on the side), then the first number on side 4 is 2030. The neighbor of 2029 is 2030, but our number is 2026, which is 3 steps before the end. Therefore, the neighbor on side 4 would be 2030 - 3 = 2027? But 2027 is already the next number on side 3. No. Wait this might not be correct.

Alternatively, if the neighbor on side 4 is related to the position on side 3. Since our number is 22 steps from the previous corner, then the neighbor on side 4 is 22 +1 = 23 steps from the corner? Not sure. 

Wait, considering that when you are in the middle of side, the diagonally adjacent number from the next side would be the number that is one less than the start of the next side minus the position. Wait this is too vague.

Wait going back to the previous example. For ring 2, third side number 12 (position 1 on side 3). The neighbor from side 2 would be number... Let's see. The number on side 2 that's adjacent to 12. Since side 2 has numbers 10, 11. The neighbors of 12 are on side 3 (13) and maybe on the inner ring or previous side. Given the example in the problem statement, where 1 is surrounded by 2, 9, etc., perhaps 12 is adjacent to 7, which is from the previous ring (ring 1). 

But how to generalize?

Perhaps the numbers adjacent from previous and next sides can be determined by looking at certain offsets from the corners. 

Given that our number is on side m, position p from the start, then:

- The neighbor from side m-1 is located at position p from the start of side m-1?

Wait, for ring k=2, side m=3, p=1: neighbor from side m-1=2 at position p=1: side 2 has numbers 10, 11. So position 1 is 10. So neighbor of 12 would be 10? But in the example, 12 is adjacent to 10? Not sure, but maybe in the spiral.

Alternatively, since moving from side m-1 to side m involves turning, maybe the number at position p on side m is adjacent to the number at position p on side m-1. Let's test with ring 2, p=1 on side 3 (number 12). The number at p=1 on side 2 is 10. Are they adjacent? In the given example, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 9... Maybe yes. 

If this is the case, then in general, the neighbor from side m-1 is the number at position p on side m-1. Similarly, the neighbor from side m+1 is the number at position p on side m+1. 

Let me test this with another example. Take ring 2, position p=1 on side 2 (number 10). The neighbor from side m-1=1 would be number at p=1 on side 1: 8. Are 8 and 10 adjacent? In the spiral, probably yes, since they are on adjacent sides. If you imagine the spiral, moving from side 1 to side 2, those numbers are adjacent. So if this holds, then for our case, the number on side m=3, position p=23 has neighbor on side m-1=2, position p=23: 1978 + 23 - 1 = 1978 + 22 = 2000. Similarly, the neighbor on side m+1=4, position p=23: starting number of side 4 is 2030, so 2030 + 23 - 1 = 2030 + 22 = 2052. Therefore, those would be two more neighbors: 2000 and 2052.

So now we have four neighbors:

- Same side: 2025, 2027.

- Previous side: 2000.

- Next side: 2052.

Still two more neighbors to find. These are likely from the inner ring (ring 25) and outer ring (ring 27). 

To find the neighbor from inner ring, we need to find the number that is directly inside the spiral, towards the center. Similarly, the neighbor from the outer ring is directly outward from the spiral. 

For a number on a side, its inner and outer neighbors depend on the position on the side. 

Let me think. For a number on side m of ring k, moving inward, the corresponding position would be on side m of ring k-1. Similarly, moving outward, it would be on side m of ring k+1. However, since the rings have different numbers of elements, the starting positions differ. 

Let me think with an example. Take a number on ring k, side m, position p. The inner neighbor would be the same position on ring k-1, side m. But since ring k-1 has sides of length k-1. If p ≤ k-1, then the number is on ring k-1, side m, position p. If p > k-1, then it's beyond the side of ring k-1, so maybe no inner neighbor? Or maybe a different rule.

Wait for our case, k=26, p=23. On ring k-1=25, each side has length 25. Since 23 ≤ 25, yes. So the inner neighbor is the number on ring 25, side m=3, position p=23. Similarly, the outer neighbor is on ring 27, side m=3, position p=23, if such a number exists. 

Let's calculate these values. 

First, inner neighbor: ring k-1=25, side m=3, position p=23.

The starting number of side 3 in ring 25:

First, S(25) = T(24) + 1.

We need to calculate T(24). Earlier we had T(k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1).

So T(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801.

Thus, starting number of ring 25 is S(25) = T(24) + 1 = 1801 + 1 = 1802.

The starting number of side m=3 is S(25) + (m - 1)*25 = 1802 + 2*25 = 1802 + 50 = 1852.

Therefore, the number on side 3, position 23 is 1852 + 23 - 1 = 1852 + 22 = 1874.

Therefore, the inner neighbor is 1874.

For the outer neighbor, ring k+1=27, side m=3, position p=23. Since ring 27 is after the current one, and we need to check if 23 ≤ length of side in ring 27, which is 27. Since 23 ≤ 27, yes.

Starting number of ring 27: S(27) = T(26) + 1 = 2107 + 1 = 2108.

Starting number of side 3 in ring 27: S(27) + 2*27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162.

Therefore, the number on side 3, position 23 is 2162 + 23 - 1 = 2162 + 22 = 2184.

Thus, the outer neighbor is 2184.

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (same side, previous)

2. 2027 (same side, next)

3. 2000 (previous side)

4. 2052 (next side)

5. 1874 (inner ring)

6. 2184 (outer ring)

Thus, the sum is 2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1874 + 2184.

Let me calculate that step by step:

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052.

Then 2000 + 2052 = 4052.

Then 1874 + 2184 = 4058.

Now, adding these three results: 4052 + 4052 = 8104; 8104 + 4058 = 12162.

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors is 12,162.

But wait, let me verify the calculations to be sure.

First, adding same-side neighbors:

2025 + 2027 = 4052. That seems correct since they are consecutive numbers.

Previous side neighbor: 2000.

Next side neighbor: 2052.

Inner: 1874.

Outer: 2184.

Now:

First pair: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

Second pair: 2000 + 2052 = 4052

Third pair: 1874 + 2184 = Let's calculate:

1874 + 2000 = 3874; then + 184 = 4058. Correct.

Then total sum is 4052 + 4052 + 4058. 

4052 + 4052 = 8104.

8104 + 4058:

Let me compute 8104 + 4000 = 12104, then +58 = 12162. Yes.

Therefore, the total sum is 12,162.

But let me check if all neighbors are correctly identified.

First, confirming the inner neighbor:

For ring 25, side 3, position 23. Calculated as 1874. Is that correct?

Starting number of ring 25 side 3 is S(25) + 2*25 = T(24) +1 + 2*25.

T(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801. So S(25) = 1802. Then side 3 starts at 1802 + 2*25 = 1802 + 50 = 1852. Position 23: 1852 + 22 = 1874. Correct.

Outer neighbor, ring 27, side 3, position 23. Starting number of ring 27 is T(26) + 1 = 2107 +1=2108. Starting number of side 3 is 2108 + 2*27=2108 + 54=2162. Position 23: 2162 +22=2184. Correct.

Previous side neighbor: ring 26, side 2, position 23. Starting number of side 2 is S(26) +1*26=1952 +26=1978. Position 23: 1978 +22=2000. Correct.

Next side neighbor: ring 26, side 4, position 23. Starting number of side 4: S(26) +3*26=1952 +78=2030. Position 23:2030 +22=2052. Correct.

Same side neighbors: 2025 and 2027: Correct.

Therefore, all neighbors are correctly identified. So the total sum is 12,162.

However, just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility that I missed a neighbor or counted something incorrectly. 

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. We've accounted for all six:

- Two from the same side.

- One from previous side.

- One from next side.

- One from inner ring.

- One from outer ring.

Yes, that makes six. 

Therefore, the answer should be 12,162.

But wait, let me check with a small example to make sure the method works. Let's take the number 2 in the given example. 

Number 2 is in ring 1, side 1, position 1.

Neighbors should be 1 (center), 3 (same side), 9 (next side), and others?

Using our method:

Same side: previous none (since position 1), next is 3.

Previous side: since side m=1, previous side would be side 6 of ring 1. Wait, but side 1's previous side is side 6. How do we calculate it?

Starting number of side m=1 is S(1) = T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. For ring 1, each side has k=1 number. So position p=1 on side m=1. The neighbor from previous side (side m-1=0? No). Wait, perhaps for m=1, previous side is m=6. 

But in general, the formula for the neighbor from previous side is side m-1, position p. But if m=1, then m-1=0, which doesn't exist. Therefore, need to adjust. 

So perhaps the sides are 1 to 6, and previous side of side m is m-1 if m >1, else 6.

Similarly, next side is m+1 if m <6, else 1.

Therefore, for m=1, previous side is 6, next side is 2.

For number 2 (ring 1, side 1, position 1):

- Same side: only next neighbor, since position 1 is the only number on the side. But since k=1, same side has only one number, so no same-side neighbors.

Wait maybe for the first ring, all numbers are corners, and each has neighbors from adjacent sides and the center.

But according to our previous method:

Neighbors would be:

Same side: none, since only one number.

Previous side (side 6): position p=1. Starting number of side 6 for ring 1. Starting number of side 1 is 2. Previous side (side 6) starts at S(1) + (6-1)*1 = 2 + 5*1 = 7. But side 6 in ring 1 has only one number, 7. Therefore, the neighbor from previous side is 7.

Next side (side 2): position p=1. Starting number of side 2 is S(1) + (2 - 1)*1 = 2 + 1 = 3. So neighbor is 3. 

Then inner ring? Since it's ring 1, there is no inner ring. Outer ring? Ring 2. But need to check. 

Wait for number 2 in ring 1, maybe it has neighbors from ring 2? But probably not, since neighbors are immediate. Actually, in the spiral, number 2 is adjacent to 1 (center) and numbers from ring 1's adjacent sides. 

But according to our method, we have:

Neighbors are: 1 (center?), 7 (previous side), 3 (next side). But what about the other neighbors? 

In reality, number 2 should have six neighbors. In the given example, we have ... 14 4 3 10 ... and so on. Let me see from the example given:

The example shows parts of the grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

From this, the center is 1. Around it: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,... It's a bit messy to see, but number 2 is adjacent to 1 and to 9 and to 3. Wait according to the example, number 2 is adjacent to 1, 9, and 3? But in that case, there are three neighbors identified, but there should be six. 

This suggests that my method might be missing some neighbors. Wait but maybe the given example is only partial. 

Alternatively, maybe my previous reasoning for the general case is incorrect. Perhaps each number on a side has more than just the six neighbors I considered. 

This inconsistency suggests I need to double-check.

Let me try with another number. Let's take number 3 in the example. The given example has the number 3 adjacent to 2, 4, 1, etc. Let me assume that in ring 1, number 3 is on side 2. Its neighbors would be:

- Same side: nothing since k=1.

- Previous side: side 1, position 1: 2.

- Next side: side 3, position 1: 4.

- Inner ring: none.

- Outer ring: ring 2, side 2, position 1: 10?

- And another neighbor?

But if there are only five, but there should be six. 

This indicates that my previous approach might be incomplete. Perhaps the outer and inner neighbors are not just along the same side. 

Alternatively, perhaps in addition to the outer and inner neighbors, there are two more from the same ring on adjacent sides? 

But in the case of number 2, which is on the corner, maybe the other neighbors are from...?

This suggests that my earlier analysis for the six neighbors might be incorrect. 

Perhaps my method works for numbers not on the corner, but for numbers on the corner, the neighbors are different. However, in our problem, 2026 is not on a corner, so maybe the method is okay. But to be sure, let me think about the general case again.

Let me consider a number on a side, not a corner. It will have:

- One neighbor on the same side before,

- One neighbor on the same side after,

- One neighbor on the previous side,

- One neighbor on the next side,

- Two neighbors from adjacent rings (inner and outer). 

Yes, that makes six. So in that case, the six neighbors are accounted for. 

However, for a corner number, which is the start of a side and end of the previous side, it has more neighbors. But since our number is not a corner, the calculation should be okay.

Given that, and since our example with number 2026 gives a consistent result with the method, I think the calculation is correct. 

Therefore, trusting the method, the sum is 12162.

Wait, but let me check with another example. Let's take number 8, which is the first number of ring 2, side 1, position 1.

Its neighbors should be:

- Same side: next neighbor is 9.

- Previous side: since it's the first side, previous side is side 6 of ring 2. Starting number of side 1 is 8, previous side 6 starts at S(2) + (6-1)*2 = 8 + 5*2= 8 +10=18. Position 1 on that side is 18. So neighbor is 18.

- Next side: side 2, position 1: starting at 8 + 2=10. So 10.

- Inner ring: ring 1, side 1, position 1? Since it's the outer ring, the inner neighbor would be the number at the same position on inner ring. Position 1 on side 1 of ring 1 is 2.

- Outer ring: ring 3, side 1, position 1. Starting number of ring 3: T(2) +1=19 +1=20. Starting number of side 1 is 20. Position 1: 20.

Therefore, the neighbors are:

8's neighbors: 9 (same side), 10 (next side), 18 (previous side), 20 (outer), 2 (inner), and another one? Wait, what's the sixth neighbor?

Ah, maybe another neighbor from the inner ring? Wait, no. Each number has six neighbors. Wait if we have:

- Same side next: 9,

- Next side: 10,

- Previous side: 18,

- Inner: 2,

- Outer: 20,

- And what's the sixth?

Possibly, there is another neighbor from the inner ring? For example, if the inner ring has another number adjacent to 8. 

Looking at the example given, number 8 is adjacent to 7 and 15 perhaps? 

Looking back at the example:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Here, the line ... 16 6 7 8 ... suggests that 8 is adjacent to 7 and 16. So in this case, the neighbors of 8 would be 7, 9, and 16. But according to our previous calculation, we have 2, 9, 10, 18, 20, and another one. 

This discrepancy shows that there's an error in our previous reasoning.

What's the issue? It seems that in addition to the inner ring neighbor, there's another neighbor from the same ring's previous side or something else.

This suggests that my method for identifying the six neighbors is incomplete. Therefore, I need to revisit the neighbor identification.

Let me analyze the example of number 8.

In the given example, 8 is at the end of side 3 of ring 2 (if my side numbering is correct)? Or perhaps at the start of side 4? Let me think.

In ring 2, numbers from 8 to 19. The sides are:

Side 1: 8, 9.

Side 2: 10, 11.

Side 3: 12, 13.

Side 4: 14, 15.

Side 5: 16, 17.

Side 6: 18, 19.

Wait in the example given, there's a part of the grid showing... 14 4 3 10 ... and ... 16 6 7 8 ... 

From the line "... 16 6 7 8 ...", it looks like 8 is adjacent to 7 and 16. Also, in the line above it, "... 14 4 3 10 ..." and ".. 15 5 1 2 9 ..." it seems like 9 is adjacent to 2, and 10 is adjacent to 3. 

But if number 8 is the last number of side 5 of ring 2 (which is 17?), no. Wait side 5 has numbers 16, 17. Then side 6 has 18, 19. 

But the example shows 8 next to 7 and 16. So number 8 must be adjacent to 7 (which is from ring 1, side 3 or something) and 16 (which is from side 5, position 1: 16). 

So neighbors of 8 must include:

- From ring 2: 9 (same side? No, 8 is the end of side 5? Or is 8 on another side?

Wait there is an inconsistency here. According to the example, number 8 is adjacent to 7 and 16, but according to our ring calculation, in ring 2, the numbers go up to 19. How is 8 adjacent to 16? If 8 is on side 4 or side 5?

This suggests that my understanding of the side numbering is incorrect. Perhaps the sides are oriented differently. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a better way to determine the neighbors.

Alternative approach: For any number, its neighbors can be determined by the ring it is in and its position. Since we can model the hexagonal grid as a coordinate system, maybe we can find a coordinate for each number and then calculate the neighbors based on that.

However, setting up a coordinate system for hexagonal spiral is non-trivial, but maybe we can use axial coordinates or something similar.

In axial coordinates, each hexagon can be represented with two coordinates (q, r), with s = -q - r. Movement in six directions corresponds to changes in these coordinates.

However, mapping numbers to axial coordinates in a spiral is complex. Instead, perhaps we can use the formulas for neighbors based on ring and side.

Earlier, we had six neighbors for 2026 as 2025, 2027, 2000, 2052, 1874, 2184. Let me check if there's a possibility that some of these are incorrect.

Take number 2026. Its neighbor 2000 is on side 2, ring 26, position 23. Let's calculate what is the difference between 2026 and 2000: 2026 - 2000 = 26. Given that they are on adjacent sides, this difference seems plausible. Similarly,
