Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal grid spiral. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grid. The example given shows numbers arranged in a hexagonal spiral, which is a bit different from the square spiral. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, right? So unlike the square grid where each cell has four neighbors (up, down, left, right), here there are six. Let me visualize that. 

First, looking at the example:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

But since it's a hexagonal grid, it's not a perfect rectangle. The way numbers are laid out might form concentric hexagons. Let me recall that in a hexagonal spiral, each layer (or ring) around the center contains more numbers. The first layer is just 1, the center. Then the next layer (distance 1 from center) would have 6 numbers, then the next layer (distance 2) would have 12 numbers, then 18, and so on. Wait, actually, each ring n has 6*n numbers. So the total number of numbers up to ring n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). Let me verify that. For example, ring 0: just 1. Ring 1: 6*1=6 numbers, total numbers 1+6=7. Ring 2: 6*2=12 numbers, total numbers 13. Hmm, but according to the formula, for n=2, 1 + 3*2*(2+1) = 1 + 6*3=19, which doesn't match. Wait, so my formula must be wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula for the number of numbers up to ring m is 1 + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... +6*m? Which would be 1 + 6*(m(m+1)/2). Wait, for m=2, that would be 1 + 6*(3) = 19. But if you have ring 1 (distance 1) has 6 numbers, ring 2 has 12 numbers, total numbers is 1+6+12=19, yes. Then the formula is correct. So if I know the total numbers up to ring m is 3m(m+1) +1. Therefore, to find which ring a certain number is in, I can solve for m such that 3m(m+1) +1 is just less than or equal to the number. Let me test with the example numbers given. The number 1 is in ring 0. Number 2 is in ring 1, since 3*1*(1+1)+1=7, which is larger than 2. Similarly, numbers from 2 to 7 (inclusive?) up to ring 1? Wait, total numbers up to ring m is 3m(m+1)+1. So for m=0, 1. For m=1, 3*1*2 +1=7. For m=2, 3*2*3 +1=19. For m=3, 3*3*4 +1=37. So each ring m (starting at 0) adds 6m numbers? Wait, no, from ring m-1 to ring m, the increase is 6m. For example, from m=0 to m=1, it's 7-1=6=6*1. From m=1 to m=2, 19-7=12=6*2. Correct. So each ring m (where m is the distance from the center) contains 6m numbers. Therefore, to find which ring a number N is in, find the smallest m such that 3m(m+1)+1 >= N. Let me formalize this. Let me denote the starting number of ring m as S(m) = 3m(m-1)+2? Wait, maybe not. Let's think. The total numbers up to ring (m-1) is 3(m-1)m +1, so the next ring m starts at that +1. Therefore, starting number of ring m is S(m) = 3(m-1)m +1 +1 = 3(m² - m) +2. Let me verify. For m=1, ring 1 starts at S(1)=3(0) +2=2. Which matches with the example since numbers in ring 1 are 2 to 7, yes. For m=2, starts at 3(1*2) +2? Wait, no. Wait according to my previous thought: the starting number of ring m is total numbers up to ring m-1 +1. The total numbers up to ring m-1 is 3*(m-1)*(m-1 +1) +1 = 3*(m-1)*m +1. Therefore, the starting number of ring m is that +1, so S(m) = 3*(m-1)*m +2. For m=1, S(1) = 3*0*1 +2=2, yes. For m=2, S(2)=3*(1)*2 +2=6 +2=8. Then ring 2 starts at 8. Total numbers up to ring 1 is 7, so numbers in ring 2 are 8 to 19-1=18? Wait, since total numbers up to ring m=2 is 3*2*(2+1)+1=19. Therefore, ring m=2 has 19-7=12 numbers, from 8 to 19-1=18. Yes. So starting numbers: 1 (ring 0), 2 (ring 1), 8 (ring 2), 19 (ring 3?), wait S(3)= 3*(2)(3)+2= 18 +2=20. But total numbers up to ring 2 is 19, so ring 3 starts at 20? Then total numbers up to ring 3 is 3*3*4 +1= 37, so numbers in ring 3 are from 20 to 36. Correct. So S(m) = 3*(m-1)*m +2.

So, for a given number N, we need to find ring m such that S(m) ≤ N < S(m+1). Once we find m, then the position of N within ring m can be determined.

Now, 2026. Let's find m such that 3m(m+1)+1 ≥ 2026. Wait, first compute the total numbers up to ring m: T(m) = 3m(m+1)+1. So we need to find m such that T(m-1) < 2026 ≤ T(m). Let me solve 3m(m+1)+1 ≥ 2026. Let's approximate:

3m² + 3m +1 ≥ 2026

3m² + 3m - 2025 ≥ 0

Let me solve 3m² +3m -2025 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

m = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 4*3*2025)]/(2*3)

Calculate discriminant:

sqrt(9 + 24300) = sqrt(24309). Let me compute sqrt(24309). Well, 150²=22500, 160²=25600. 155²=24025. 155²=24025. Then 155² +284=24309. 155 + x squared = 24309. Let me compute 155^2=24025. 24309-24025=284.

So (155 + x)^2 ≈ 24025 + 310x. Let me set 310x ≈284. x≈284/310≈0.916. So sqrt≈155.916. So approximate m≈[ -3 + 155.916 ] /6 ≈ 152.916 /6 ≈25.486. So m≈25.486. Therefore, m=26 is the first integer where T(m) ≥2026. Let me check T(25)= 3*25*26 +1= 1950 +1=1951. T(26)= 3*26*27 +1= 2106 +1=2107. So 2026 is between T(25)=1951 and T(26)=2107. Therefore, 2026 is in ring m=26. Wait, wait, here m is the ring number? Earlier, we saw that T(m) is the total numbers up to ring m. Wait, but earlier, for ring m, the total numbers is T(m)=3m(m+1)+1. Therefore, if T(m-1) < N ≤ T(m), then N is in ring m. Wait, if m=26, then the previous total is T(25)=1951, and T(26)=2107. Therefore, 2026 is in ring m=26. But earlier, we had S(m)=starting number of ring m is 3*(m-1)*m +2. For m=26, S(26)=3*25*26 +2= 1950 +2= 1952. So numbers from 1952 to 2107-1=2106 are in ring m=26. So 2026 is in ring 26. Now, the position within the ring. The numbers in ring m=26 start at 1952, so position within the ring is k = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 75? Wait, let me check. The first number is position 1: 1952, then position 2: 1953,... up to position 6m. Since ring m=26 has 6*26=156 numbers. Therefore, the position k within the ring is 2026 - S(m) +1=2026 -1952 +1=75. So k=75. Therefore, the number is the 75th number in ring 26.

Now, in a hexagonal spiral, each ring is divided into six "sides", each side having m numbers. Wait, ring m has 6m numbers, so each side has m numbers? For example, ring 1 (m=1) has 6 numbers, each side has 1 number. Ring 2 (m=2) has 12 numbers, each side has 2 numbers. So in general, each ring m has 6 sides, each with m numbers. So the position within the ring can be used to determine which side the number is on, and how far along the side.

So for position k in ring m, we can determine side number s = ceil(k/m). Or s = ((k-1) // m) +1. For example, if k ranges from 1 to 6m. For m=26, k=75. Let's compute how many numbers per side: m=26, so each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, the first side has positions 1 to 26, second 27 to 52, third 53 to 78, fourth 79 to 104, fifth 105 to 130, sixth 131 to 156. Since k=75 is in the third side (53-78). Wait, 75 is between 53 and 78. So third side. Then, the position along the side is 75 - (s-1)*m. Where s=3. So 75 - 2*26 =75-52=23. Therefore, the number is on the third side of ring m=26, 23rd position from the start of that side.

Now, we need to figure out where this position is, to find the neighbors. To do that, perhaps it's helpful to know the coordinates or relative positions in the grid. However, since I don't have the exact grid coordinates, maybe I need another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates based on the ring and position.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of each ring m as being hexagonal, with numbers arranged in six directions, and the neighbors can be calculated based on ring and position. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to compute the coordinates (x, y) in a hexagonal grid, then find neighbors based on coordinates.

But maybe I can think in terms of axial coordinates. In hexagonal grids, axial coordinates (q, r) can be used, with s = -q - r. But maybe I need more info.

Alternatively, maybe for each number, there's a way to compute coordinates based on the ring and position, then neighbors can be calculated.

Alternatively, there's a formula for the neighbors in such a spiral. However, since I don't remember such a formula, maybe I need to figure it out.

Alternatively, think of the spiral as layers, and figure out how numbers are placed.

Let me try to think of the hexagonal spiral. In such a spiral, movement is similar to square spiral, but with more directions. The numbers increase as you spiral outward. Each full ring is completed by moving in six directions. For example, starting from the center (number 1), moving right (say), then up-right, up, up-left, left, down-left, down, down-right, etc., completing the spiral.

But perhaps each ring is constructed by moving in six "arms", each arm adding m numbers. Each arm corresponds to one side of the hexagon.

For example, in ring m=1, starting at 2, moving right to 2, then since m=1 each arm has 1 step.

But maybe I need to think of the starting position of each ring. Let me consider coordinates. Let's assume axial coordinates (q, r, s), with q + r + s = 0.

But maybe instead of that, use offset coordinates. Alternatively, cubic coordinates. Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think of the hexagonal grid as having coordinates where each step is in one of six directions. For example, directions like east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast.

But perhaps to model this spiral, there's a consistent way to move. Maybe similar to the square spiral, where each layer increases the ring number and the direction changes periodically.

Alternatively, since the problem is about the neighbors of a number, perhaps I can find the coordinates of 2026 and then calculate the neighbors based on that.

But how to find coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps observe that in hexagonal numbers, the numbers at the end of each ring have a particular property. For example, the last number in ring m is T(m) = 3m(m+1)+1. Wait, no, T(m) is the total number of numbers up to ring m. The last number in ring m would be T(m). For example, ring 1 ends at 7, which is T(1)=7. Ring 2 ends at 19=T(2)=3*2*3 +1=19. Wait, earlier I saw that numbers in ring m start at S(m) = 3(m-1)m +2. So ends at T(m) -1. For example, ring m=2 starts at 8 and ends at 19-1=18.

Therefore, the last number in ring m is T(m) -1 = 3m(m+1)+1 -1= 3m(m+1). Therefore, the numbers at the end of each ring are 3m(m+1). For example, m=1: 3*1*2=6, but the end number for ring 1 is 7. Wait, there is a discrepancy. Wait, earlier, T(m) is the total numbers up to ring m. So the last number in ring m is T(m). But earlier calculation shows that for ring m=1, T(1)=7. So that would mean the last number in ring 1 is 7. Similarly, for ring m=2, last number is T(2)=19. But according to numbers in the example, in ring 2 (which starts at 8), total numbers up to ring 2 is 19, so the last number in ring 2 is 19. Wait, but in the first example given, the numbers go up to 16, 15,... Maybe the example was part of a larger grid.

Anyway, if the last number in each ring m is T(m) = 3m(m+1) +1? Wait no, T(m) is the total numbers up to ring m. Wait confusing. Let me rephrase:

Total numbers up to ring m is T(m) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^m 6k} = 1 + 6*(m(m+1)/2) = 1 + 3m(m+1). So T(m) = 3m(m+1) +1.

Therefore, the last number in ring m is T(m). The first number in ring m is T(m-1) + 1 = 3(m-1)m +1 +1 = 3(m² -m) +2.

Therefore, numbers in ring m go from 3(m² -m) +2 to 3m(m+1) +1.

So for example, m=1: 3(1 -1) +2= 0 +2=2 to 3(1)(2) +1=6 +1=7. Correct. Similarly for m=2: 3(4 -2)+2= 3*2 +2=8 to 3*2*3 +1=18+1=19. Correct.

So the last number in each ring is T(m) = 3m(m+1) +1. However, in the example, the first ring (m=1) ends at 7, which is the center of the next ring?

Now, perhaps each ring m ends with a number that is located in a specific direction from the center. For example, in a hexagonal spiral, moving along one direction for m steps to complete a side. The last number of each ring would be at a corner of the hexagon.

Therefore, if I can figure out the coordinates for the numbers in the ring, based on their position, then I can figure out the neighbors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the coordinates of a number in a hexagonal spiral. But since I don't have that, I need to derive it.

Alternatively, consider that each ring m has six sides, each with m numbers. The numbers progress along each side. So, for a given number in ring m, once we know which side it's on and how far along the side it is, we can figure out its position relative to the center.

Let me think of the hexagonal grid as having axial coordinates. In axial coordinates, there are three axes, but only two are needed because q + r + s = 0. For simplicity, let me use axial coordinates (q, r). Let me assume that the center is at (0, 0). Then, moving in six directions, each step in a direction corresponds to a change in coordinates.

In the hexagonal spiral, starting from the center, direction can be tracked. However, it's complicated to track the exact path. However, perhaps there's a way to compute the coordinates based on ring and position.

Alternatively, note that each ring m is at a distance m from the center. In axial coordinates, the distance from the center is max(|q|, |r|, |s|). If I can find the coordinates (q, r) such that the number is located there.

Alternatively, think about the positions for the start of each ring. For example, what is the position of S(m)=3(m-1)m +2?

For m=1, S(1)=2. The center is 1. Then moving along the first direction, which is say, east. So 2 is east of 1. Then 3 is northeast of 2? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the example provided in the problem:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

This is a snippet of the spiral. Let me see if I can figure out the directions.

Looking at the center number 1. Around it, we have on the top line: 15, 5; then 1, then 2, 9. Then the next line is 14,4,3,10...; 16,6,7,8...

Assuming the numbers increase as you spiral outward. So starting from 1, going to 2, then 3, then 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. Let me try to imagine the directions.

From 1, going to 2: maybe east direction. Then 3 is northeast of 2? Then 4 is north of 3? Then 5 is northwest of 4? Then 6 is west of 5? Then 7 is southwest of 6? Then 8 is south of 7? Then 9 is southeast of 8? Then 10 is east of 9? Then 11? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a standard way to lay out the spiral. Let me try to reconstruct the example.

Looking at the lines given:

First line (probably top line): ... 14 4 3 10 ...

Second line: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

Third line: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Assuming the hex grid is laid out in rows, with each row having more hexagons as you go out. The second line shows the center '1' with numbers around it. Let me try to arrange this as a hexagonal grid. In a hexagonal grid, each hex has neighbors above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right? Wait, but in axial coordinates, neighbors are in different directions.

Alternatively, in the given example, the number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15 or something? Let's see:

Looking at the second line: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ... So '1' is between 5 and 2? Then in the third line: ... 16 6 7 8 ... So adjacent to 2 is 9 and maybe 8? Also, above 1 is 5 and below is 6? Then the neighbors of 1 are 2 (east?), 9 (southeast?), 8 (south?), 7 (southwest?), 6 (west?), and 5 (northwest?).

But this is getting a bit confusing without a visual. Alternatively, maybe I can figure out the directions based on numbers. Let's think of the spiral starting at 1, then moving east to 2, then northeast to 3, then northwest to 4, then west to 5, then southwest to 6, then southeast to 7, then east again? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers increase in the following way for the first few layers:

Ring 0 (center): 1

Ring 1 (distance 1):

The numbers go around the center. Let me think the order is east (2), northeast (3), northwest (4), west (5), southwest (6), southwest? No... Let me use the example. From 1, number 2 is to the east. Then number 3 is northeast of 2? Looking at the given example, number 3 is adjacent to 1 and 2? Because in the first line ... 14 4 3 10 ... and second line .. 15 5 1 2 9 ... So 3 is between 4 and 2? So maybe it's between northwest and east? Maybe 4 is above 3 and 2 is to the east. If the layout is:

Let me try to represent the grid as rows, where each row is a line in the hex grid. The given example has:

Row 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...

Row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

Row 3: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Assuming that each row is staggered, with odd and even rows offset. Let me think of it as:

Imagine a hex grid where each hex has horizontal rows. The second row has numbers 15, 5, 1, 2, 9. The first row is above it with numbers ... 14, 4, 3, 10 ... and the third row is below with ... 16, 6, 7, 8 ...

In such a layout, the neighbors of 1 (row 2, position 3) would be: above left (4), above right (2), left (5), right (9), below left (6), below right (7). Wait that might make sense.

So the neighbors of 1 are 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Looking at the numbers given:

- To the north (above) of 1 is between 4 and 3? Or is it the 4 and 5? Wait, row 1 has 14 4 3 10... So maybe row 1 has 14 ... 4 ... 3 ... 10... Then in row 2, it's ... 15 5 1 2 9 ..., so maybe the number above 1 is 4? And to the northwest is 15? Wait, getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps use axial coordinates to assign coordinates. Let me try.

In axial coordinates, each hex can be represented by two coordinates q and r, with s = -q - r. The six neighbors of a hex (q, r) are:

(q-1, r+1), (q, r+1), (q+1, 0), (q+1, r-1), (q, r-1), (q-1, r).

Wait, I might be misremembering. Alternatively, the six directions in axial coordinates can be represented as:

Direction 0: (+1, 0, -1)

Direction 1: (+1, -1, 0)

Direction 2: (0, -1, +1)

Direction 3: (-1, 0, +1)

Direction 4: (-1, +1, 0)

Direction 5: (0, +1, -1)

But since we are using axial coordinates with q and r, maybe each direction corresponds to a change in (q, r).

Alternatively, according to some references, axial coordinates use q and r, and the six directions are:

(1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1)

But not sure. Maybe need to adjust.

Alternatively, let me try to find a way to assign coordinates based on the spiral.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can find another way to determine the neighbors.

Since I know the number 2026 is located in ring m=26, position k=75 within the ring, which is on the third side of the ring, 23 positions from the start of that side. The third side probably corresponds to a certain direction.

In a standard hexagonal spiral, each ring has six sides. The sides can be thought of as follows: starting from the end of the previous ring, each side goes in a particular direction for m steps. The direction changes every m steps. 

To figure out the direction of each side, let me consider how the spiral progresses. For example, if the first ring (m=1) starts at 2 and goes east, then northeast, etc. But without a diagram, this is challenging.

Alternatively, refer to the example. Let's look at the numbers around 1. The number 2 is east of 1, number 3 is northeast of 2, then number 4 is north of 3, number 5 is northwest of 4, number 6 is west of 5, number 7 is southwest of 6, number 8 is south of 7, number 9 is southeast of 8, number 10 is east of 9, etc. If this is the case, then the spiral goes East, Northeast, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South, Southeast, East, etc., repeating every six directions. However, for each ring, the number of steps in each direction increases.

Wait, for ring m=1 (6 numbers), each direction is only 1 step. Starting at 1, moving east to 2 (end of side 1), then northeast to 3 (end of side 2), then north to 4 (end of side 3), then northwest to 5 (end of side 4), then west to 6 (end of side 5), then southwest to 7 (end of side 6). Then ring m=2 starts from 7, moving southwest? No, because the next number after 7 is 8. If you follow the example given in the problem: ... 14 4 3 10 ...; .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...; ... 16 6 7 8 ... So after 7 comes 8, then 9, then 10, etc. So after completing ring m=1 (ending at 7), the next number 8 is south of 7. So in ring m=2, the first side is moving south for 2 steps (since m=2), so from 7, moving south to 8, then to 9 (but 9 is in the example at position ... 2 9 ...). Wait, but according to the previous logic, perhaps each side has a different direction. Maybe for ring m=2, the six sides are in directions: south, southeast, east, northeast, north, northwest? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each ring starts with a particular direction. Let's try to find the starting point of each ring.

For example, ring m=1 starts at 2, which is to the east of 1.

Ring m=2 starts at 8, which in the example is south of 7.

So direction from 7 to 8 is south.

Then, ring m=2 continues for 2 steps in that direction? Let's see: 7 (end of ring 1), 8 (south of 7), 9 (south of 8?), but in the example, 9 is adjacent to 2 (from the second line: ... 1 2 9 ...). If 9 is southeast of 8? Maybe the first side of ring m=2 is direction south for 2 steps: 7 ->8 ->9, then the next side is southeast for 2 steps: 9 -> ... something?

But this might not be the case. Given the complexity, perhaps there's a pattern to the direction changes between rings.

Alternatively, given that the problem is about the neighbors of 2026, which is a large number, perhaps I can find formulas for the neighbors based on ring and position in the ring.

Each number has six neighbors. In general, the neighbors can be:

- One number before in the same side of the ring.

- One number after in the same side.

- Numbers from adjacent sides of the ring.

But need to consider edge cases when the number is at the end of a side.

Alternatively, since I know the ring m=26 and the position within the ring k=75, which is on the third side of the ring (since each side has 26 numbers, first side 1-26, second 27-52, third 53-78, so k=75 is 75-52=23rd in third side), maybe I can figure out the neighbors.

Let me consider the structure of the ring. Each side of the ring has numbers progressing in a particular direction. When you are on the third side, your neighbors along the side are the previous and next number on that side. Additionally, there are five other neighbors from adjacent positions in other directions.

However, to determine the exact numbers, I need to figure out how the numbers are placed relative to the ring sides.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the neighbors based on the ring number and position.

Alternatively, think about the numbers that are adjacent to a number N in the spiral. In a hexagonal spiral, each number has six neighbors, which can be 6 numbers around it. However, depending on whether N is on a "side" or at a "corner" of the ring, some neighbors are in different rings.

For example, if N is in ring m, then its neighbors can be:

- Two numbers in the same ring.

- Three numbers in the previous ring (m - 1).

- One number in the next ring (m + 1).

But I need to verify.

Alternatively, let me think of the numbers surrounding a position. For example, take number 2 (ring 1, first side). Its neighbors should include 1 (previous ring), 3 (same side next), and others. But need more concrete data.

Alternatively, refer to the example given. Take number 2, which is in the example adjacent to 1, 3, 9, etc. Wait in the example, the neighbors of 2 are 1, 3, 9, and others? The second line shows 1 2 9, so neighbors to the right is 9, left is 1, and above? From the first line ... 4 3, so above 2 is 3? And below 2 is maybe 8 or something? 

This is too ambiguous without a clear diagram. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Perhaps consider that for any number in the spiral, except the center, it is on one of six sides of a ring. Each side progresses in a particular direction, and when moving from one side to another, you turn at a corner.

For a number in the middle of a side (not at the start or end of the side), its neighbors are:

- The number before on the same side.

- The number after on the same side.

- The number from the previous side at the same position (offset?).

- The number from the next side at the same position.

- And two more neighbors?

Wait, no. In a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors. If you are on a side of a ring, moving along the side, your neighbors in the same ring are the previous and next on the side, and then there are other neighbors from adjacent directions. However, depending on the side, these could be in the same ring or different rings.

Alternatively, consider that each side of the ring runs in a straight line in one of the six directions. If the number is not at the end of the side, then two of its neighbors are along the same side (previous and next number), and the remaining four neighbors are in other directions.

However, without knowing exact directions, this is still abstract.

Alternatively, think of the numbers in the ring in terms of their offset from the start of the ring. Given that ring m has numbers S(m) to T(m).

For a number in ring m, position k (with k from 1 to 6m), let's define:

- prev_same_side: k - 1.

- next_same_side: k + 1.

- But when k is at the end of a side, the next_same_side moves to the next side.

But since our number is in the middle of the third side, at position 23 from the start of the third side (k=75), then the same-side neighbors are 74 and 76.

But these numbers are consecutive in the spiral. However, how do these relate to the neighbors of 2026?

If the spiral is constructed such that moving along a side increases the number by 1 each step, then 2026 has neighbors 2025 and 2027 on the same side. However, since we need the six neighbors, there are four more to find.

Alternatively, consider that moving from one side to another, each corner of the ring is where a side ends and another begins. Each corner number is connected to the next ring. For example, the end of a side is adjacent to the start of the next ring or something.

But maybe if I can figure out the neighbors of 2026, which is in ring m=26, on the third side.

Let me think of the third side. Since there are six sides, let's denote them from 0 to 5. Let's assume that each side corresponds to a direction from the previous ring.

But given that I can't determine exact directions, perhaps I need another way. Maybe think of the numbers adjacent to a given number in the spiral as follows:

If you have a number N in ring m, then the number before it is N - 1, and after it is N + 1, but these are not necessarily the only neighbors. But other neighbors depend on the position in the ring.

However, there's another approach used in square spirals where the distance from the center can be used to compute coordinates and hence neighbors. Maybe similar for hexagonal.

Another idea: In a hexagonal grid, the numbers at the six corners of the ring m are:

These can be calculated as follows: each ring has six corners, which are the end points of each side. For example, the first corner of ring m is T(m - 1) + 1 = S(m), the next corner is S(m) + m, then +m, etc., since each side has m numbers. Wait:

Since each side has m numbers, the first corner is at position 1 in the ring (S(m)), then the next corner is at position m + 1 (end of first side, start of second side), then position 2m +1 (end of second side...), etc. So the six corners of ring m are at positions:

1, m +1, 2m +1, 3m +1, 4m +1, 5m +1.

Each of these positions corresponds to the starting corner of each side.

For our case, ring m=26, the corners are at positions:

1, 27, 53, 79, 105, 131, and then the next would be 157 which is beyond 156. Wait, 6*m=156, so last corner is at 5m +1= 5*26 +1=131, then sixth side ends at 6*26=156, so sixth corner is also the end of the ring?

Wait, the first corner is position 1 (start of ring), which is also the end of the previous ring? No, it's the start of the current ring. Maybe each corner is the end of a side.

So the six corners of ring m are located at positions:

k = m*1, k = 2m, ...? No, wait if each side has m numbers, then the end of each side is at position m, 2m, 3m, ..., 6m. Wait, position ranges for sides are [1, m], [m+1, 2m], ..., [5m +1, 6m]. Therefore, the end of the first side is at k = m, end of second at 2m, ..., sixth side at 6m. Therefore, corners are at positions m, 2m, ..., 6m.

Therefore, for ring m=26, the corners are at k=26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 156. So our number is at k=75, which is on the third side (since 53 ≤ 75 ≤78). The third side goes from k=53 to 78. So 75 is 75-52=23rd number on the third side. 

Now, in terms of position on the side, being the 23rd number on the third side of ring m=26. The first number on the third side is at k=53 (which is position 53 = 2m +1, since m=26). Wait, no, the third side is from 2m +1 to 3m. With m=26: 2*26 +1=53 to 3*26=78. Correct.

Now, if I think of the third side of the ring as a line of 26 numbers, moving in some direction, then the number at position 23 on this side is not at the beginning or end of the side. Therefore, its same-side neighbors are k-1=74 and k+1=76. These correspond to numbers 2025 and 2027. But how do they relate to the neighbors in the grid? They could be two of the six neighbors of 2026. But what about the other four?

The other neighbors would come from adjacent directions. Since the third side is part of a hexagonal ring, adjacent sides would meet at the corners. For a number in the middle of the third side, its neighbors would also have components from adjacent sides. However, without knowing the exact direction of the sides, it's hard to determine.

Perhaps we can think about how the numbers change as we move around the ring. For example, when moving from one side to another, the numbers increase by m? Or follow some pattern.

Alternatively, consider that each side of the ring is aligned with a particular direction, and moving from one ring to another involves moving inward or outward in that direction. 

Let me think of the general formula for neighbors in a hexagonal spiral. 

In hexagonal grids, each hex has six neighbors. If you can determine the coordinates (q, r) of the given number N, then you can find its neighbors by adding the six direction vectors. But I need to find N's coordinates.

Alternatively, since we can calculate which ring and position N is in, maybe we can derive its coordinates based on ring m and position k.

Let me attempt to find the coordinates.

Assume that the center is at coordinate (0, 0). Each ring m is at a distance m from the center.

For a given ring m and position k, we can determine the direction and offset along that direction.

Since the ring is divided into six sides, each of length m, the position k tells us which side we're on. As calculated before, for k=75 in ring m=26, it's on the third side.

Let me associate each side with a direction vector. Let's define the six directions as follows (in axial coordinates):

- Side 1: Direction 0: (1, 0)

- Side 2: Direction 1: (0, 1)

- Side 3: Direction 2: (-1, 1)

- Side 4: Direction 3: (-1, 0)

- Side 5: Direction 4: (0, -1)

- Side 6: Direction 5: (1, -1)

Wait, but need to verify if this makes sense. In axial coordinates, each direction corresponds to a vector. However, without knowing the exact spiral direction, this is an assumption. Let's proceed with this assumption and see if it works with the small example.

For example, in ring m=1, starting at position k=1 (number 2). If side 1 is direction (1, 0), then the coordinate would be center (0,0) plus direction * m? Since it's ring m=1, so moving one step in direction (1, 0) would lead to (1, 0). Similarly, the number 2 would be at (1, 0). Then side 2 is direction (0,1), so adding (0,1) to the previous end. The end of side 1 is at (1,0), then side 2 moves along direction (0,1) for m=1 steps. So starting at (1,0) + direction (0,1): but wait, to move along a side, we need to figure out the starting point of the side.

Actually, the starting point of each side can be determined based on the previous side. For example, the first side starts at the end of the previous ring (T(m-1)), which for m=1 would be T(0)=1. Then moving along direction 0 for m=1 step to reach the end of side 1 at position k=1. Wait, no. For m=1, the first side is from k=1 to k=1 (since m=1), so only one number: 2. So the starting point of side 1 is at position k=1, which is number S(m)=2=3*(m-1)*m +2=3*0*1 +2=2.

The starting coordinates of ring m=1: assuming it starts at direction 0 (east) from the center, so (1,0). 

Then side 1 of ring m=1 is from (1,0). Side 2 starts at the end of side 1, which is still (1,0) since it only had one step? No, moving in direction 0 for one step gets you to (1,0). Then side 2 moves in direction 1 for one step. But direction 1 would be (0,1). Adding that to previous position (1,0) gives (1,1)? But in axial coordinates, the distance from center would be max(1,1, -2) = 2, but it should be in ring m=1, distance 1. Hmm, this suggests inconsistency. 

Maybe my assumption about the directions is incorrect. Let me try another approach. In hexagonal grids, moving in one direction repeatedly increases one of the coordinates. To stay in a ring at distance m, perhaps the starting point of each side is at a corner of the previous ring.

For example, the end of side 6 of ring m-1 is the starting point of side 1 of ring m.

This recursion could help define the coordinates.

Alternatively, consider that each corner of the ring m is located at a specific coordinate. For example, the first corner of ring m is m steps in the direction of side 1 from the previous ring.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe look for an existing formula or pattern for coordinates in a hexagonal spiral.

Upon recalling, there's a way to compute the position of a number in a hexagonal spiral using mathematical formulae. For example, the numbers at the corners of each ring are hexagonal numbers, etc. But I need to recall.

The numbers at the corners of each ring in a hexagonal spiral are given by 6*(m²) +1? Wait, earlier we saw that the last number of ring m is T(m)=3m(m+1) +1. For example, for m=1, it's 7, which is 6*(1) +1? No, 6*1 +1=7, which matches. For m=2, T(2)=3*2*3 +1=19, while 6*(m²) +1=6*4 +1=25, which does not match. So that formula is wrong. Alternatively, the numbers at the corners might be something else.

Alternatively, notice that each ring has six corners, and each corner is shared between two sides. For example, the end of side 1 is the start of side 2, etc. The value at each corner is the end of a side, which is at k= m, 2m, 3m, etc. So for ring m=26, corners are at numbers:

Let me compute the numbers at the corners of ring m=26. The starting number of the ring is S(m)=3*(m-1)*m +2 =3*25*26 +2= 1950 +2=1952. The numbers at the corners are S(m) + m -1, S(m) +2m -1, ..., let's see:

First corner (end of first side): S(m) + m -1 =1952 +26 -1=1952 +25=1977.

Second corner (end of second side): S(m) +2m -1=1952 +52 -1=2003.

Third corner (end of third side): 1952 +78 -1=1952 +77=2029.

Fourth corner: 1952 +104 -1=3045? Wait, 3m=78. Wait, the k positions of the corners are at m, 2m, ..., 6m. So for the numbers at the corners:

Number at first corner: S(m) + (m -1) =1952 +25=1977.

Number at second corner: first corner + m=1977 +26=2003.

Number at third corner: 2003 +26=2029.

Fourth corner: 2029 +26=2055.

Fifth corner: 2055 +26=2081.

Sixth corner: 2081 +26=2107, which is T(m)=3*26*27 +1=2106 +1=2107. Correct.

So our number 2026 is on the third side of the ring, between the second corner (2003) and third corner (2029). Specifically, since it's at position k=75, which is 75-52=23 on the third side. The third side has m=26 numbers, from k=53 (1952 +52=2004?) Wait, let me check:

Wait the first corner is at k=m=26, which is number 1952 +25=1977.

Second corner at k=2m=52, number is 1977 +26=2003.

Third corner at k=3m=78, number is 2003 +26=2029.

So the third side goes from k=53 to k=78, numbers from 2004 to 2029.

Since our number is 2026, which is 2029 -3=2026. So it is 3 steps before the third corner. Since the third side has 26 numbers, from k=53 (2004) to k=78 (2029). The position k=75 is 78 -3=2029 -3*1=2026. So, moving from the end of the third side back 3 steps. 

This means that the number 2026 is 3 steps away from the third corner in the direction opposite to the side's direction. So if the side is moving in some direction from the start to end, then moving backwards 3 steps from the end gets to 2026.

Now, knowing that, maybe we can find its neighbors.

Assuming that each side moves in a particular direction. Let's denote that for the third side of ring m, the direction is, say, direction D. Then, each step along the side is +D. The number at the end of the third side is at position third corner, 2029. The number before is 2028, then 2027, 2026, 2025,...

If that's the case, then the number after 2026 is 2027, which is the next step along the side, and before is 2025. These are two neighbors. The other neighbors would be related to the neighbors in other directions.

In a hexagonal grid, each hex has six neighbors. For a hex on a side, two are along the side, and four others. Two of those four are from adjacent sides within the same ring, and the other two are from previous or next rings?

Wait, if the hex is in the middle of a side, then two of its neighbors are along the side (previous and next). The other four are: two from the previous ring (the inner ring), and two from the same ring but adjacent sides.

But need to figure out what those would be.

Alternatively, for any hex on a side of ring m, its neighbors in the same ring would include the previous and next along the side, and two others at the "ends" of the side. But I need to visualize.

Let me think of the hexagon ring m as a regular hexagon with each side having m hexes. For a hex in the middle of a side, it has two neighbors along the side, and one neighbor from each adjacent side of the same ring, plus one neighbor from the inner ring and one from the outer ring?

Wait, not sure. Let me think of a simple case: ring m=1, number 2. It is on the first side (from 2 to 7)? No, for m=1, ring has numbers 2-7. The first side has just one hex (number 2). Its neighbors would include numbers from the previous ring (1), and numbers from adjacent sides of the same ring (3 and 9?) But this is getting back to the earlier example.

If I can determine the coordinates of the number, I could add the six direction vectors. Since I can't easily determine the coordinates without a defined direction system, maybe I can use the numbers.

For number N in the middle of a side of ring m, two of its neighbors are N-1 and N+1 (along the side). Two more neighbors are from the adjacent corners. Wait, if it's on the third side, moving towards the third corner, then maybe the other neighbors relate to numbers from other sides.

Alternatively, consider that when you're on a side, you can move to the "inner" direction (towards the center) and "outer" direction (away from the center). These would correspond to numbers in different rings.

For example, moving from N towards the inner ring would give a neighbor in ring m-1, and moving outward would give a neighbor in ring m+1. However, since N is already in ring m, moving outward would be to ring m+1 only if it's at a corner? Or maybe at the start/end of a side?

Wait, if you are in the middle of a side, moving perpendicular to the side's direction towards the outside would take you to ring m+1, and towards the inside to ring m-1. 

But how does that translate to numbers?

Let me think about the difference in numbers. For example, take number 2026, which is in ring m=26, third side, 3 steps before the corner. Let's find its neighbors:

- Along the side: 2025 and 2027.

- Moving inward: this would be a number in ring m-1=25. What is that number?

- Moving outward: this would be a number in ring m+1=27. What is that number?

- And two more neighbors from adjacent sides in the same ring.

So total six neighbors. If I can calculate these, I can sum them up.

Let me try to calculate these.

First, the inward neighbor. To move inward from 2026, we need to determine what number is directly inward from it. Similarly for outward.

In a hexagonal spiral, moving from a side towards the center would land you on a number in the previous ring. The question is, which number?

Let me think about the position of 2026. It is on the third side of ring 26, 3 steps from the end. Let me consider the geometry. Each side is a straight line of hexes moving in a certain direction. Moving inward from this side would be moving in the opposite direction of the side's perpendicular... This is too vague.

Alternatively, consider that the inward neighbor can be calculated as N - 6*(m-1). Wait, for example, in ring m, each layer adds 6*m numbers. But this might not hold.

Alternatively, there is a formula for the inward neighbor. Let me think of how numbers change as you move inward.

For example, take the number at the end of the third side of ring m=26: 2029. What is the inward neighbor? It should be the number directly towards the center from 2029. If 2029 is a corner of ring m=26, then moving inward from it would take you to the corresponding corner of ring m-1=25.

But what is that number? Let me find the corresponding corner in ring m-1.

For ring m-1=25, the corners are:

First corner of ring 25: S(25)=3*(24)*25 +2=1800 +2=1802. Then numbers at the corners: 1802 +25-1=1802+24=1826, then +25=1851, +25=1876, +25=1901, +25=1926, +25=1951, which is T(25)=3*25*26 +1=1950 +1=1951. Correct.

The third corner of ring m=26 is 2029. The corresponding inward direction would be the third corner of ring m-1=25, which is 1876. But how is this related to 2029? The difference is 2029 - 1876 = 153. So if I move inward from 2029, I get to 1876. Similarly, for a number 3 steps before the corner (2026), moving inward would be 2026 - 153 = 2026 -153= 873?

Wait, let's verify with a smaller example. Take number 7, which is the end of ring m=1. Its inward neighbor should be 1. According to this logic: for m=1, third corner is third side end. For m=1, third corner is at k=3*1=3, which is number S(1) +2*1=2 + 2=4? Wait no, earlier for m=1, corners at k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (since 6*1=6). The numbers are: first corner at k=1: S(1) +1 -1=2 +0=2, k=2: 2+1=3, k=3:4, k=4:5, k=5:6, k=6:7=T(1). So third corner at k=3 is number 4. Inward neighbor of 4 would be the third corner of ring m=0? But ring m=0 only has number 1. So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps each number on a side has an inward neighbor which is offset by (m-1)*some value. This is getting too trial-and-error.

Another idea: For any number N in ring m, its inward neighbor is N - 6*(m-1) -1? Not sure. Let me take N=7 (end of ring m=1). If inward neighbor is 1. 7 - 6*(1-1) -1= 7-0-1=6, which is not 1. Nope.

Alternatively, the inward neighbor for a number on a side is the number on the same "direction" in the previous ring. For example, if a number is on the third side of ring m, its inward neighbor is on the third side of ring m-1, but offset somehow.

Since our number 2026 is on the third side of ring 26, 3 steps from the end, its inward neighbor should be on the third side of ring 25, similarly offset from the end. Since each side of ring m is length m, and our number is 3 steps from the end on its side, then on ring m-1=25, the third side has length 25. Therefore, the corresponding inward number would be 3 steps from the end of side 3 of ring 25. Let's compute that number.

For ring m=25, third corner is at k=3*25=75, which is number S(25) + 2*25 =3*(24)*25+2 +50= 1800 +2 +50=1852? Wait no, earlier for m=25, first corner is at k=m=25, number is 1802 +25-1=1826. Second corner at k=50: 1826 +25=1851. Third corner at k=75:1851 +25=1876. So third side of ring 25 goes from k=51 to 75, numbers from 1852 to 1876. Our inward neighbor would be 3 steps from the end, which is 1876 - 3 =1873.

Similarly, the outward neighbor of 2026 would be on the third side of ring m+1=27, 3 steps from the end of that side. Let's calculate that.

For ring m+1=27, starting number S(27)=3*(27-1)*27 +2=3*26*27 +2=2106 +2=2108. The third corner of ring 27 is at k=3*27=81, which is number S(27) + 2*27 =2108 +54 =2162. The third side goes from k=53 to 81, numbers from 2108 + 52 =2108 + (52)=2160? Wait no, the start of the third side is at k=2*27 +1=55, so number is S(27) + 2*27 =2108 + 54=2162? No, this is getting confusing. Let me use the previous method.

The corners of ring 27 are at numbers:

First corner: S(27) + 27 -1 =2108 +26=2134.

Second corner:2134 +27=2161.

Third corner:2161 +27=2188.

Fourth:2188 +27=2215.

Fifth:2215 +27=2242.

Sixth:2242 +27=2269=T(27)=3*27*28 +1=2268 +1=2269.

So the third side of ring 27 goes from second corner (2161) +1=2162 to third corner (2188). It has 27 numbers. The number three steps before the end (third corner) is 2188 -3=2185.

Therefore, if the outward neighbor of 2026 is 2185, then that's one neighbor.

Additionally, the inward neighbor is 1873.

Now, we also need two more neighbors from adjacent sides in the same ring.

Since 2026 is on the third side of ring m=26, the adjacent sides are second and fourth.

The transition between sides is at the corners. For example, at the end of the second side (corner 2003), the next side (third) starts. The number after 2003 is 2004. Similarly, at the end of the third side (corner 2029), the fourth side starts.

Now, for a number in the middle of the third side, its neighbors from adjacent sides might be related to the starts of those sides or something else.

Specifically, for a number on the third side, not at a corner, its neighbors would include one from the end of the second side and one from the start of the fourth side?

Alternatively, think of it as, when you're on a side, the adjacent sides meet at the corners. So moving from the third side, towards the second side direction and fourth side direction.

But how does this translate to numbers?

Let me think of the number 2026, which is on the third side, 3 steps from the end. Let's consider moving from this number in the direction towards the second side and fourth side. 

For example, if the third side is moving in some direction, then moving perpendicular to it towards the second side and fourth side would give neighbors.

But without knowing the exact direction, this is hard. However, using the earlier idea of offsets, perhaps these neighbors are related to the numbers on the adjacent sides at a certain offset.

If the number is 3 steps from the end of the third side, maybe its neighbor towards the second side is 3 steps from the end of the second side, and similarly for the fourth?

Let me explore this. 

The second side of ring m=26 goes from k=27 to k=52, numbers from 1952 +26=1978 to 2003. The end of the second side is at k=52, number 2003. If we move 3 steps from the end of the second side, that would be 2003 -3 =2000. Is 2000 a neighbor of 2026?

Similarly, the fourth side starts at k=79, number 2030, and goes to k=104, number 2030 +25=2055. If we move 3 steps from the start of the fourth side, that would be 2030 +3=2033. Is this a neighbor of 2026?

If this pattern holds, then the four neighbors would be:

- Inward:1873

- Outward:2185

- Adjacent side 2:2000

- Adjacent side 4:2033

Plus the same-ring neighbors:2025 and 2027.

But how can we verify this?

Let's take a smaller example. For example, take number 4, which is on the third side of ring m=1 (since for m=1, the third side goes from k=3 to k=3, which is number 4). Its neighbors should include 3 and 5 (along the side?), but since it's at the corner, it has neighbors from adjacent rings and sides. But let's try applying the same logic.

If we consider the inward neighbor: for m=1, number 4 (third side), inward neighbor would be 3 steps from end of third side of m-1= ring 0, but ring 0 has only 1. This doesn't make sense. So our earlier assumption might not hold for all cases, but maybe for numbers not at the end of the side.

Alternatively, perhaps the offsets should be different. For example, if the number is i steps from the end of its side, then its neighbors on adjacent sides are i steps from the start/end of those sides.

For our case, 2026 is 3 steps from the end of the third side. Therefore, its neighbor on the second side would be 3 steps from the start of the second side? Or end?

Wait, the second side ends at the third side's start? No, the first side ends at the start of the second side. Let me visualize the ring as follows:

- Side 1: from previous ring end to first corner.

- Side 2: first corner to second corner.

- Side 3: second corner to third corner.

- ... etc.

Therefore, the third side starts at the second corner. If our number is on the third side, 3 steps from the end (third corner), then moving towards the second side would be towards the start of the third side (which is the second corner). But how to translate this to adjacent numbers?

Perhaps the neighbor from the second side is the number on the second side that is parallel to our position. For example, if the third side is extending from the second corner in some direction, then each position on the third side has a corresponding position on the second side, offset by the direction.

This is too vague. Let me try using the previous example where we assumed neighbors at 2000 and 2033.

If 2026 has neighbors 2025, 2027, 1873, 2185, 2000, 2033, what is their sum? Let's compute:

2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 2185 + 2000 + 2033 = let's calculate step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

4052 + 1873 = 5925

5925 + 2185 = 8110

8110 + 2000 = 10110

10110 + 2033 = 12143

Is this the correct sum? I need to verify if these numbers are indeed the neighbors.

To verify, let's take a smaller number where we can manually check the neighbors. Let's take number 2, which is on the first side of ring m=1. Its neighbors should include 1, 3, and others. 

Applying the same method:

For number 2 (m=1, k=1, first side, 0 steps from the start (since it's the first number), and m-0=1 step from the end).

Inward neighbor: would be 0 steps from the start of the previous ring's side? Since m=1, previous ring is m=0 with only number 1. So it's 1.

Outward neighbor: number on ring m+1=2, first side, 0 steps from start. For m=2, first side goes from k=1 (number 1952 for m=26... no, for m=2, S(2)=8. First side goes from 8 to 8+2-1=9. First side has m=2 numbers. Wait, first side of ring m=2: starts at S(2)=8, ends at 8+2-1=9. The start of the first side is 8, end is 9. The outward neighbor from 2 (which is the first side of m=1) would be the first side of m=2, 0 steps from start, which is 8. But according to our earlier formula, if the number is i steps from the end of its side, then outward neighbor is i steps from the end of the next ring's side. Number 2 is in m=1 first side, i=0 steps from end (since it's the only number). So outward neighbor is 0 steps from the end of m=2 first side, which is 9. But manually, the neighbor of 2 should include 9? In the example given, number 2 is adjacent to 9. Yes! In the example, ... 1 2 9 ..., so 2 is adjacent to 9. So according to our formula, outward neighbor is 9, which is correct. Also, inward neighbor is 1, correct. The other neighbors would be from adjacent sides. For number 2 on the first side, what are the other neighbors? From the sixth side of the ring and second side? Since it's at the start of the first side, adjacent to the end of the sixth side of ring m=1. 

The sixth side of ring m=1 ends at k=6, number 7. The end of sixth side is 7. Number 2 is at the start of first side. If our formula says that for i=0 steps from end (which is the start), then the neighbor from the sixth side would be i=0 steps from the start of the sixth side? No, it's at the end of the sixth side.

This is getting too complex, but at least for the case of outward and inward neighbors, the formula seems to work. For number 2, outward neighbor is 9, and inward is 1. 

Applying the same logic to our number 2026, its outward neighbor is 2185 and inward is 1873. 

Now for the adjacent sides: let's assume that the number 2026 has neighbors from the second and fourth sides at 2000 and 2033. How can we verify this?

Let me try another small example. Take number 3, which is on the second side of ring m=1 (k=2, since first side k=1:2, second side k=2:3). Number 3 is 0 steps from the start of the second side (since it's the first number on the second side), and 1 step from the end of the second side.

Using the same logic, its neighbor from the first side would be 0 steps from the end of the first side, which is number 2. And neighbor from the third side would be 0 steps from the start of the third side, which is number 4. So neighbors would include 2 (previous side), 4 (next side), 1 (inward), and 9 (outward)? Let's check with the example given. Number 3 is adjacent to 4, 2, and what
