<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral. Let me try to visualize the spiral. They showed the beginning part: the center is 1, then moving around it, there are numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Then numbers go around each layer. 

First, let me recall how hexagonal numbers work. In a hexagonal grid, each layer around a number adds more numbers. In a square spiral, each layer has a certain number of elements based on the level. But for a hexagonal spiral, I think each layer adds more numbers as well. Wait, let me think. In a hexagonal grid, each concentric ring around the center has 6 more numbers than the previous ring. For example, the first ring around the center (which is 1) has 6 numbers, the next ring has 12 numbers, then 18, and so on. 

But let me verify that. In the given example, the center is 1. Then, the next layer would be numbers 2 through 7. Wait, but looking at the partial grid given:

Looking at the partial grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... So maybe the first layer (starting from 1) is numbers from 2 to 7? That's 6 numbers. Then the next layer starts at 8 and goes up to... Let me see. The numbers are going up, so next layer would be from 8 to 19? Let me count. If each layer adds 6 more numbers than the previous? Wait, first layer (layer 1) has 6 numbers, then layer 2 has 12 numbers? Wait, let me check how many numbers each layer has.

In square spirals, each layer adds 8 more numbers, but with corners. For hexagonal numbers, the formula for the number of elements in each layer might be different. 

Alternatively, hexagonal numbers. Wait, centered hexagonal numbers. The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is 3n(n-1) + 1. But maybe that's not directly helpful here. Let me think. In a hexagonal grid, each ring around the center has 6n numbers, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 1 around center (radius 1) has 6*1=6 numbers, layer 2 has 6*2=12 numbers, etc. So total numbers up to layer n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). 

But how does this help me? Let me think. For example, the last number in layer n is 1 + 3n(n+1). Wait, let me check with the numbers given. Let's check for n=0 (center only): 1. For n=1: total numbers would be 1 + 3*1*(1+1) = 1 + 6=7. So the last number in layer 1 is 7. Then layer 2: total numbers would be 1 + 3*2*(2+1)=1+18=19. So last number in layer 2 is 19. So that matches with the partial grid given, since numbers go up to 10,15,... but maybe next numbers go up to 19. So for layer 0 (center):1. Layer 1: 2-7 (6 numbers), layer 2: 8-19 (12 numbers). Then layer 3 would be 20-? Let me calculate. Total numbers up to layer 3 would be 1 + 3*3*4= 1 + 36=37, so layer 3 has 37 -19=18 numbers. Which is 6*3=18. So yes, each layer n has 6n numbers. 

So, given a number, how do I find which layer it is on? For example, to find the layer for 2026. Let me think. The total numbers up to layer n is 1 + 3n(n+1). So we need to find n such that 1 + 3n(n-1) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3n(n+1). Wait, because the total numbers up to layer n-1 is 1 + 3(n-1)(n). Then layer n has 6n numbers. Let me verify. For n=1: total numbers up to layer 0 is 1. Then layer 1 adds 6(1)=6 numbers, so total is 1 + 6 = 7. Yes. For n=2: up to layer 1 is 7, then layer 2 adds 12 numbers, so total numbers is 7 + 12 = 19. So yes. Therefore, to find layer n where 2026 lies, solve for n.

Let me set up the inequality:

1 + 3n(n-1) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3n(n+1)

First, solve 3n(n+1) + 1 ≥ 2026.

So approximate the value of n. Ignoring 1 and solving 3n(n+1) ≈ 2026. Let me approximate:

Let me approximate n^2 ≈ 2026 / 3 ≈ 675. So n ≈ sqrt(675) ≈ 25.98. So n is about 26. Let me check for n=25 and n=26.

Total numbers up to layer 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

Layer 26: adds 6*26 = 156 numbers. So total numbers up to layer 26 is 1951 + 156 = 2107

Therefore, 2026 is between 1951 + 1 = 1952 and 2107, so in layer 26. 

So 2026 is in layer 26. 

Now, how to determine its position within the layer. 

The numbers in layer 26 start at 1952 and go up to 2107. 

So 2026 is 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in layer 26 (since starting from 1952 is 1st number). 

So position within layer is 75.

Now, each layer has 6n numbers, so layer 26 has 6*26=168 numbers... Wait hold on earlier calculation said numbers up to layer 25 is 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951. Then layer 26 has 6*26= 156 numbers. So total numbers up to layer 26 is 1951 + 156 = 2107. 

But 2026 - 1951 = 75. So the 75th number in the layer 26.

Now, each layer is divided into 6 segments (or sides) of the hexagon. Each side of the hexagon has n numbers? Wait, for layer n, there are 6n numbers, so each side of the hexagon would have n numbers. Wait, for example, layer 1: 6*1=6 numbers, each side has 1 number. Which makes sense. Layer 2: 12 numbers, each side has 2 numbers. So for layer 26, each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, each of the 6 directions on the hexagon has 26 numbers.

Therefore, the 75th number in layer 26 would be which segment? 75 divided by 26 is 2.88... So each segment is 26 numbers. So first segment: 1-26, second 27-52, third 53-78, fourth 79-104... So 75 is in the third segment, position 75 - 2*26 = 75 -52=23rd number in the third segment. So third segment, 23rd position.

Now, what does this mean in terms of coordinates? Maybe I need to figure out the coordinates of the number 2026 in the hexagonal grid, then find its neighbors. Alternatively, maybe figure out what the neighbors are based on the position in the layer.

But perhaps there's a better way.

First, perhaps I can figure out the distance from the center. The layer number is 26, so the distance from the center is 26. Each layer corresponds to a distance. 

But how does the numbering go? In a hexagonal spiral, the movement. Let me think about how the spiral is constructed.

In the given example, starting from the center (1), moving to 2, then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Then going around. Maybe the direction changes at each corner. For example, starting at 1, go east to 2, then northeast to 3, then northwest to 4, then west to 5, then southwest to 6, then southeast to 7, then east again? Not sure. Maybe the exact path is similar to square spiral but adapted for hex.

Alternatively, think of the hexagonal grid as having axial coordinates. In axial coordinates, each point is identified by three coordinates (q, r, s) with q + r + s = 0. But maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps use offset coordinates. But maybe I need to think geometrically. 

Alternatively, consider that each layer consists of 6 directions. Let me think: each full circle around the center takes you through six directions. For each layer, moving along one side of the hexagon adds numbers. 

In square spirals, the layers have sides that increase with the layer number. For hexagonal, perhaps each side of the hexagonal layer has numbers that increase in a certain fashion.

But perhaps another approach. Let's think about the coordinates of each number in terms of direction from center. For example, each layer is built by moving in six directions.

Alternatively, maybe think of the numbers in terms of the six directions. For example, in the first layer, numbers 2-7, each adjacent to the center in different directions.

But perhaps the key is that each layer has numbers that can be reached by moving one of six directions, and each direction's numbers in that layer can be calculated.

But maybe I need to figure out the neighbors of a number in the spiral. Since the neighbors are six numbers around it, each in different directions. 

But since the numbers are laid out in a hexagonal spiral, each number (except for the center) has six neighbors. So for 2026, which is on layer 26, third segment, 23rd number.

But how to figure out the numbers adjacent to it? Maybe figure out the coordinates of 2026, then find numbers at adjacent coordinates?

Alternatively, maybe think about the neighbors in terms of the spiral structure. 

Alternatively, since we know the position of the number within its layer, maybe we can find how many steps away it is from the "corner" numbers, and then determine the neighbors accordingly.

First, let's think about what numbers are adjacent to a given number in the hexagonal spiral. Let me look at the given example. For instance, the number 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, 9, and others? Wait, in the given grid:

Looking at the partial grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So the neighbors of 2 are: 1, 3, 9, and maybe others. Wait, in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For the center 1, neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For the number 2, neighbors would be 1, 3, 9, and also numbers on the other side? Wait, need to see more of the grid. For example, if the grid continues:

Assuming that the next layer (layer 2) numbers go up to 19. For instance, after 8, there is 17, 18, 19? Not sure. Maybe need to figure out the path.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the spiral construction. Let me try to sketch the spiral steps.

Starting at 1 in the center.

First, layer 0: 1.

To build layer 1 (first ring around 1), moving in some directions. Let me think: in a hexagonal spiral, the spiral could move in directions like: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, and so on. The exact path is important. 

Alternatively, similar to square spiral, where you go in a certain direction for a number of steps, then turn. 

In a hexagonal spiral, a possible path could be: starting from 1, go east to 2, then northeast for one step to 3, then northwest for one step to 4, then west for one step to 5, then southwest for one step to 6, then southeast for one step to 7, then east for two steps to 8, 9, then northeast for two steps, etc. Wait, perhaps?

This is similar to how square spirals have increasing steps after turning. But in hexagons, maybe after completing a layer, the next layer requires moving two steps in each direction before turning? Not sure. Let me try to reconstruct.

In the given example, the numbers go from 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in the first ring, then 8, 9, 10, 11,... up. Looking at the partial grid:

Looking at the line:

.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

So from 1, going to 2 is east? Then from 9, going back? Maybe not. Let me think in terms of coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe look up some references in my mind. In a hexagonal grid, a spiral can be constructed by moving in the six directions, increasing the number of steps after every six directions. For example, moving east 1, then northeast 1, then northwest 1, then west 1, then southwest 1, then southeast 1, then east 2, northeast 2, etc. This would create a spiral. Each complete loop would add layers. 

If that's the case, then for each layer n, you have 6n numbers. Each side of the hexagon has n numbers. For example, first layer (n=1) has each side 1 number, total 6. Second layer (n=2) has each side 2 numbers, total 12. So the movement for layer n is moving each direction for n steps.

Now, if we can figure out the position of 2026 within its layer, which we did (layer 26, third segment, 23rd position), then maybe we can figure out its direction and position relative to the center, and then figure out its neighbors.

Alternatively, maybe think about the neighbors in a specific layer. For example, in a given layer, each number (except maybe at the "corners") will have neighbors in adjacent positions and also in adjacent layers.

But maybe another approach: in hexagonal coordinates, each number can be represented with coordinates (x, y, z) such that x + y + z = 0. The distance from the center would be max(|x|, |y|, |z|). But maybe not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps assign to each number a position in terms of its "ring" (layer) and its position along the ring.

But perhaps think of the neighbors of a number in the spiral. For a number not at a corner of its layer, its neighbors are:

- One in the same segment (previous or next number in the layer),

- One in the previous segment of the same layer,

- And one in the next segment of the same layer,

And also three numbers from the previous and next layers? Or not?

Wait, maybe for a number in the middle of a side of the hexagon, its six neighbors are:

Two from the same layer (left and right along the side),

Two from adjacent layers (one from the layer inside and one from the layer outside?),

Wait, actually, in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. So if I can figure out where exactly 2026 is located in the spiral, I can figure out which numbers are adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe think of the neighbors based on the position within the layer.

Given that 2026 is in layer 26, which is the 75th number in that layer, which is in the third segment (positions 53-78), 23rd position in that segment. Each segment has 26 numbers, which would correspond to moving in one direction of the hexagon.

So, for example, starting from the "corner" of the layer, moving along one side of the hexagon, placing numbers as you go. Then at each corner, the direction changes.

So if the number is in the middle of a side (not at a corner), then its neighbors along the same side are the preceding and following numbers in the layer. Additionally, it has neighbors from adjacent sides of the same layer and from adjacent layers.

But perhaps the key is that moving along a side, each step increases the number by 1. Therefore, the neighbors along the same side are the previous and next numbers. But also, there are other neighbors.

But maybe we need to find for 2026:

1. The number before it in the layer.

2. The number after it in the layer.

3. The number at the start of the segment.

Wait, but that might not be direct neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the coordinates. Let me try to model coordinates.

Let me recall that in axial coordinates for hex grids, each hexagon can be represented with two coordinates, say q and r, with s = -q - r. 

The distance from the center is max(|q|, |r|, |s|). 

But to figure out coordinates, need a way to map numbers to coordinates.

Alternatively, since each layer corresponds to a distance from the center. The center is distance 0, layer 1 distance 1, ..., layer 26 distance 26. 

But how to get coordinates? Maybe consider the direction we are facing when placing numbers. 

Assuming the spiral goes in the following directions each time:

The spiral goes in six directions, labeled 0 to 5, with each direction corresponding to a movement in axial coordinates. For example, direction 0 could be east, direction 1 northeast, direction 2 northwest, etc. 

Each time you complete a layer, you move to the next layer, starting by moving in the same direction as the previous layer started, but taking one more step? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, let's think about how the numbers are laid out. For example, starting from 1 at center.

First, moving east to place 2, then northeast to place 3, then northwest to place 4, then west to place 5, then southwest to place 6, then southeast to place 7, then east to place 8, 9, then northeast to place 10, 11, then northwest to place 12, 13, then west to place 14, 15... and so on. 

This is similar to how some hex spirals are constructed, where after completing a full loop, you spiral outwards by increasing the number of steps in each direction before turning.

In that case, each direction in the spiral is repeated for a certain number of steps. For the first layer (n=1), each direction is taken once. Then for layer n=2, each direction is taken twice. Wait, but in the example, moving from 7 back to 8 would be moving east again for two steps (positions 8 and 9), then northeast for two steps (10, 11), northwest for two steps (12, 13), west for two steps (14, 15), southwest for two steps (16, 17), southeast for two steps (18, 19), completing layer 2.

Yes, this seems to fit. For example, the numbers from 8 to 19 (layer 2: 12 numbers) are formed by 6 directions, each direction taken 2 steps.

So generalizing, for layer m, the number of steps in each direction is m. Wait, but layer m has numbers 6m. So layer 1: 6 numbers, steps per direction 1. Layer 2: 12 numbers, steps per direction 2. So for layer n, steps per direction is n. 

But the total number of layers is cumulative. Wait, actually each layer is defined by the distance from the center. So for distance d=0 (center), then d=1 (layer 1), d=2 (layer 2), etc.

So the numbers are generated by spiraling outward, increasing the number of steps in each direction each time you complete a full loop.

Now, to find the coordinates of a number, we can model the spiral movement. 

Given that, let me try to model the coordinates for numbers in the spiral. Let me consider axial coordinates (q, r, s) with q + r + s = 0. Let me pick direction 0 as east, direction 1 as northeast, etc. Each step in axial coordinates can be represented as:

Direction 0 (east): q increases by 1.

Direction 1 (northeast): r increases by 1, s decreases by 1.

Wait, perhaps better to pick axial coordinates where movement directions correspond to six vectors. Alternatively, use cube coordinates for hex grids, which are (x, y, z) with x + y + z = 0. Each hex direction corresponds to a vector:

e.g., for axial coordinates:

The six directions can be represented as:

0: (1, 0, -1)

1: (1, -1, 0)

2: (0, -1, 1)

3: (-1, 0, 1)

4: (-1, 1, 0)

5: (0, 1, -1)

These are the six directions in the hex grid. 

Starting from the center (0, 0, 0).

To construct the spiral, we go in direction 0 for 1 step (to (1, 0, -1)), then direction 1 for 1 step, then direction 2 for 1 step, etc., then when returning to the starting direction, we increase the number of steps.

Wait, actually, as per the previous idea, for each layer m, starting at m=1, we move in directions 0 to 5, each time m steps. But how does the spiral progress? Actually, each time we finish the six directions for a layer, we have completed a ring. But how to connect between layers. Actually, to spiral, after completing the six directions of a layer, you need to move one more step in the same direction as the first direction of the next layer? Or maybe repeat the same sequence?

Wait, in the example, after layer 1 ends with 7, then direction 0 (east) takes two steps (layer 2, directions 0-5, 2 steps each). So the first direction of layer 2 is direction 0, same as layer 1. So starting from 7 (which is at the end of layer 1), moving in direction 0 for two steps to get 8, 9. Then direction 1, two steps 10, 11, etc.

Therefore, the spiral is constructed by for each layer m (starting from m=1), moving in the six directions, 0 to 5, each direction for m steps. 

Therefore, the total numbers per layer is 6*m. Which matches our previous analysis.

Therefore, to find the coordinates of 2026, we can track the spiral construction.

Since 2026 is in layer 26, which is the 75th number in the layer. So to find the 75th number in layer 26, which is the 75th step in the spiral construction for layer 26. 

But first, we need to find where in the spiral construction of layer 26 does our number fall. Since each layer is constructed by going through the six directions, each for m steps. For layer m=26, each direction has 26 numbers. Therefore, 6 directions with 26 numbers each. 

So direction 0: numbers 1-26 (positions 1-26 in the layer),

direction 1: 27-52,

direction 2: 53-78,

direction 3: 79-104,

direction 4: 105-130,

direction 5: 131-156.

Our number is the 75th number in the layer, which is in direction 2 (since 53-78 is direction 2). Specifically, 75 - 52 = 23rd step in direction 2.

So the number is in direction 2, step 23. 

Therefore, we can model the coordinates by starting at the beginning of layer 26, direction 2.

Wait, but to track coordinates, we need to know where the beginning of each layer is. 

Alternatively, we can simulate the spiral up to that point, but that might be tedious. However, maybe we can find a formula.

Let me think recursively. Each time we finish a layer, we have completed six directions for the previous layer. Wait, actually, to get to layer m, we need to go through layers 1 to m. So coordinates of a number can be determined by knowing which direction and step in that direction it is in layer m.

Alternatively, let's consider that each layer starts at a certain point. Let me think of the starting point of each layer. 

For example, the first layer (m=1) starts at the center (1) and moves direction 0 to get to 2. Then direction 1 to 3, etc. After completing direction 5, the last number of the layer is 7. Then layer 2 starts, moving direction 0 for two steps to get 8,9.

Therefore, the starting point of each layer m is the end of the previous layer's last direction (direction 5). To find the coordinates at the start of layer m, we can note that it's at the end of layer m-1's last direction.

Therefore, recursively, we can compute the starting coordinates for each layer. 

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps observe that each direction in layer m adds a certain vector to the current position. For example, starting at the center, to build layer m, we go through directions 0 to 5, each time moving m steps. 

But the starting position of each layer m is determined by the end of the previous layer.

Alternatively, since each direction in the spiral is determined by a vector, if we can figure out the starting position of layer 26, and then apply direction 2 for 23 steps, we can reach the coordinates of 2026.

Therefore, we need to find the starting position of layer 26. 

Let me think about how coordinates change when moving through the layers. 

Let me denote the position at the start of layer m as P_m. 

For example:

- P_1 is the position after the center, which is when we start layer 1. Wait, actually layer 1 starts from the first step after the center? Or does layer 1 start at the center? 

Actually, layer 0 is just the center. Layer 1 consists of the first ring around the center, which is 6 numbers. The first step to build layer 1 is from the center to the first position (number 2). Therefore, the starting position of layer 1 is adjacent to the center in direction 0. 

But to find P_m, starting positions of each layer, let's think recursively. For each layer, after completing all six directions, the end position is such that moving one more step in direction 0 would start the next layer. 

Therefore, the starting position of layer m is the end position of layer m-1. 

Therefore, to find P_m, we can find where layer m-1 ends. 

But how to find the coordinates of P_m? Perhaps by considering that each layer m is constructed by moving through directions 0 to 5 with m steps each.

Therefore, for each layer m, starting at position P_m, moving direction 0 for m steps, then direction 1 for m steps,... up to direction 5 for m steps. 

Therefore, the end position of layer m is P_m + (sum of vectors for directions 0 to 5 multiplied by m steps).

But the sum of the six direction vectors is zero. Since moving once in each of the six directions brings you back to the starting point. For example:

Each direction vector:

d0: (1, 0, -1)

d1: (1, -1, 0)

d2: (0, -1, 1)

d3: (-1, 0, 1)

d4: (-1, 1, 0)

d5: (0, 1, -1)

Adding them all up:

(1 + 1 + 0 -1 -1 + 0, 0 -1 -1 + 0 + 1 + 1, -1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 -1) 

Calculates as:

x: 1 + 1 -1 -1 = 0

y: -1 -1 + 1 +1 = 0

z: -1 + 1 + 1 -1 = 0

Therefore, the total displacement after going through all six directions is zero. Therefore, after completing a layer, the end position is the same as the starting position. Therefore, each layer closes on itself. Therefore, the starting position of layer m is the same as the ending position of layer m-1 plus some vector? Wait, but if a layer closes on itself, how do we move outward to the next layer?

Wait, that seems contradictory. If after completing layer m, you end up at the starting position of layer m, how do you get to the starting position of layer m+1?

Ah, maybe my understanding is wrong. Perhaps the layers are not closed in this manner. Wait, maybe the layers are built by moving in directions and each subsequent layer is larger. Maybe the way to get from one layer to the next is by taking an extra step? Let me think with an example.

Take layer 1: starting at some position, moving in directions 0 to 5 with 1 step each. Suppose starting at position P_1. After completing the layer, you end at P_1 again. But to get to the start of layer 2, you need to move in direction 0 again for 2 steps. How is that possible if you end where you started?

Wait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the layers are defined differently. Maybe each layer is constructed by moving from the previous layer's end in a certain direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the layers are not closed. Wait, how does the spiral proceed? For example, after placing number 7 (end of layer 1), where is the position? In the given grid, the next number is 8 which is in direction 0 (east) from the previous position. So from number 7, moving east for two steps (to 8 and 9). Therefore, the starting position of layer 2 is the end position of layer 1 plus one step in direction 0? Or is the end of layer 1 actually adjacent to where the next layer starts? 

Maybe we need to model the movement step by step for small layers.

Let me try constructing coordinates step by step for the first few layers.

Starting at center (0, 0, 0) = number 1.

Layer 1:

Start at center, direction 0 (east): move 1 step. New coordinates: (1, 0, -1) = number 2.

Then direction 1 (northeast): move 1 step. The direction vector is (1, -1, 0). So add that to current position:

(1 + 1, 0 - 1, -1 + 0) = (2, -1, -1)? Wait, but cube coordinates must satisfy x + y + z = 0. 

Wait, current position before direction 1 is (1, 0, -1). Adding direction 1's vector (1, -1, 0) gives (1+1, 0 + (-1), -1 + 0) = (2, -1, -1). Sum: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0. Okay.

So number 3 is at (2, -1, -1).

Then direction 2 (northwest): vector is (0, -1, 1). Adding to previous position (2, -1, -1): (2 + 0, -1 + (-1), -1 + 1) = (2, -2, 0). Sum: 0. Number 4.

Then direction 3 (west): vector (-1, 0, 1). Adding to (2, -2, 0): (2 -1, -2 + 0, 0 +1) = (1, -2, 1). Sum: 0. Number 5.

Then direction 4 (southwest): vector (-1, 1, 0). Adding to (1, -2, 1): (1 -1, -2 + 1, 1 + 0) = (0, -1, 1). Sum: 0. Number 6.

Then direction 5 (southeast): vector (0, 1, -1). Adding to (0, -1, 1): (0 + 0, -1 +1, 1 + (-1)) = (0, 0, 0). Sum: 0. Number 7. 

So we end up back at the center. That's the end of layer 1. But then how do we start layer 2?

Starting layer 2: moving direction 0 for 2 steps. But where is the starting position? It should be at the end of layer 1, which is the center. Wait, but if we start at center and move direction 0 for 2 steps, we'd go to (2, 0, -2), which is number 8, then another step to (3, 0, -3) which would be number 9. Then direction 1 for two steps. 

But then where is number 8 and 9? Let's check the example given:

In the given grid, the line:

.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

So between 2 and 9, there are numbers... So number 2 is adjacent to 9? Which is only true if they are diagonally opposite? But maybe. However, if number 9 is two steps east from the center, then coordinates of 9 would be (2, 0, -2). Whereas number 2 is (1, 0, -1). The distance between them is 1 step. So they are neighbors. Which makes sense if in the grid, they are adjacent.

But according to the coordinates, yes. The coordinates of 2 is (1, 0, -1), and 9 is (2, 0, -2). The difference between them is (1, 0, -1), which is direction 0. So they are adjacent. So number 2 and 9 are neighbors. 

But according to the grid provided:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So number 9 is to the east of number 2, which matches. 

Thus, the starting position of layer 2 is the center. Wait, but after finishing layer 1, we ended up at the center. So the starting position of layer 2 is the center? But then moving direction 0 for 2 steps goes from center to (1, 0, -1) [number 8? Wait, no. Wait, starting at layer 2's starting position is... Wait, number 7 ended at center. Then starting layer 2, moving direction 0 for 2 steps. 

Wait, but number 7 is at center. Then the next number is 8, which is moving direction 0 one step from center: (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 -1) = (1, 0, -1). That's number 8. Then another step in direction 0: (2, 0, -2) which is number 9. 

Then direction 1 for two steps: first step adds direction vector (1, -1, 0): (2 + 1, 0 -1, -2 + 0) = (3, -1, -2) = number 10. Second step: add direction vector (1, -1, 0): (4, -2, -2) = number 11.

Then direction 2 for two steps: vector (0, -1, 1). Starting from 11 (4, -2, -2). Add vector: (4, -2 -1, -2 +1) = (4, -3, -1) = number 12. Then another step: (4, -4, 0) = number 13.

Then direction 3 (west): vector (-1, 0, 1). Starting at (4, -4, 0). Add (-1, 0, 1): (3, -4, 1) = number 14. Another step: (2, -4, 2) = number 15.

Then direction 4 (southwest): vector (-1, 1, 0). Starting from (2, -4, 2). Add (-1, 1, 0): (1, -3, 2) = number 16. Another step: (0, -2, 2) = number 17.

Then direction 5 (southeast): vector (0, 1, -1). Starting from (0, -2, 2). Add (0, 1, -1): (0, -1, 1) = number 18. Another step: (0, 0, 0) = number 19. 

So layer 2 ends at the center again, and layer 3 starts from there. 

Therefore, the coordinates for the start of layer m is the center. But how? Because each layer starts from the center? No, because after layer 1, we came back to the center. Then layer 2 also starts at the center and goes around again, and ends at the center. Then layer 3 also starts at center...? But that would mean that each layer is built starting from the center, going around, and returning to the center. But how does the spiral move outward? Because if all layers start from the center, the numbers would overlap? But in reality, the numbers don't overlap; each number is unique in the grid. How is this possible?

Ah, no, because for each layer m, we are taking m steps in each direction. So for layer 1, we take 1 step each, so it's the first ring. For layer 2, taking 2 steps each, it's a bigger ring. Even though starting at the center, moving two steps east takes you further out. So each layer is built starting from the center, spiraling outwards. 

Therefore, coordinates of numbers can be determined by tracking how many times each direction has been taken. However, since multiple layers can pass through the same directions, the coordinates depend on the cumulative steps in each direction. 

But how does this help us find the coordinates of a number in layer m? Since for each layer m, starting at the center, we move in direction 0 for m steps, direction 1 for m steps, etc. Therefore, the position of a number depends on:

- The number of layers completed before (layers 1 to m-1). Each of these layers contributes to the position by starting and ending at the center. However, when building layer m, we start at the center again? Wait, but how do you move outward? 

Actually, no. Wait, when building layer m, the path starts at the center, but to get to the numbers in that layer, you move m steps in each direction. However, since previous layers have already placed numbers in those directions, the coordinates of the numbers in layer m are further out. 

For example, number 2 in layer 1 is 1 step east from the center.

Number 8 in layer 2 is 2 steps east from the center.

So in general, for a number in layer m, direction d, step k (1 ≤ k ≤ m), the coordinates are obtained by moving from the center, k steps in direction d. Wait, but only if no previous steps are taken in that direction? That can't be, because to get to that position, you have to go through the previous directions and layers.

Wait, no. Because each layer is built by going around the spiral. However, the coordinates of a number in layer m, direction d, step k would be the center plus k steps in direction d plus the movements from previous directions and layers? 

This is getting complicated. Maybe there is a formula for the coordinates of the number which is in layer m, direction d, step k. 

Alternatively, think that the numbers in layer m, along direction d, are the numbers that are exactly m steps away from the center along direction d. But considering that previous layers have already occupied directions. 

Wait, but in reality, each time you go around, you are adding more steps in each direction. For example, the number that is 2 steps in direction 0 is part of layer 2. But it's also adjacent to the number that is 1 step in direction 0 (layer 1). 

Therefore, the coordinates of a number in layer m, direction d, step k (where k ranges from 1 to m), is simply k steps from the center in direction d. Therefore, its coordinates are:

If direction d is as per the cube coordinates:

For direction 0: (k, 0, -k)

Direction 1: (k, -k, 0)

Wait no. Wait, each step in direction d adds the direction vector. For example, moving k steps in direction 0 adds the vector (1, 0, -1) multiplied by k. Therefore:

Coordinates after k steps in direction 0: (k, 0, -k)

Similarly for other directions:

Direction 1: each step is (1, -1, 0). So k steps: (k, -k, 0).

Direction 2: each step is (0, -1, 1). So k steps: (0, -k, k).

Direction 3: (-k, 0, k).

Direction 4: (-k, k, 0).

Direction 5: (0, k, -k).

Therefore, any number in layer m, direction d, step k has coordinates corresponding to k steps in direction d.

But does that mean that for example, number 8 is in layer 2, direction 0, step 2: coordinates (2, 0, -2). Which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, number 2 is layer 1, direction 0, step 1: (1, 0, -1). Correct.

Therefore, this seems like a valid way to get coordinates for numbers in a given layer, direction, and step. 

Therefore, since we have determined that 2026 is in layer 26, direction 2, step 23. 

Direction 2's step vector is (0, -k, k). For k=23, direction 2: (0, -23, 23). Therefore, coordinates of 2026 are (0, -23, 23).

Wait, but must satisfy x + y + z = 0. Indeed, 0 + (-23) + 23 = 0. Correct. 

Therefore, coordinates of 2026 are (0, -23, 23). 

Now, we need to find the six neighbors of this hexagon. In cube coordinates, the six neighbors are obtained by adding each of the six direction vectors:

The six direction vectors are:

d0: (1, 0, -1)

d1: (1, -1, 0)

d2: (0, -1, 1)

d3: (-1, 0, 1)

d4: (-1, 1, 0)

d5: (0, 1, -1)

Therefore, the six neighbors of (0, -23, 23) are:

Adding each direction vector:

Let me compute each one:

1. (0 +1, -23 +0, 23 + (-1)) = (1, -23, 22)

2. (0 +1, -23 + (-1), 23 +0) = (1, -24, 23)

3. (0 +0, -23 + (-1), 23 +1) = (0, -24, 24)

4. (0 + (-1), -23 +0, 23 +1) = (-1, -23, 24)

5. (0 + (-1), -23 +1, 23 +0) = (-1, -22, 23)

6. (0 +0, -23 +1, 23 + (-1)) = (0, -22, 22)

So these are the six neighbor coordinates.

Now, we need to find the numbers corresponding to each of these coordinates. 

To do this, we need to find, for each of these six coordinates, which number lies there in the spiral. 

This seems challenging, but maybe we can find a formula or method to convert coordinates to numbers. 

First, note that each coordinate has a distance from the center, defined as the maximum of |x|, |y|, |z|. Since in our case, for (0, -23, 23), distance is max(0, 23, 23) =23. Therefore, the neighbors can be in layer 22, 23, 24. Let's check:

For neighbor coordinates:

1. (1, -23, 22): distance is max(1,23,22)=23

2. (1, -24, 23): max(1,24,23)=24

3. (0, -24, 24): max(0,24,24)=24

4. (-1, -23, 24): max(1,23,24)=24

5. (-1, -22, 23): max(1,22,23)=23

6. (0, -22, 22): max(0,22,22)=22

Therefore:

- Neighbors 1 and 5 are in layer 23.

- Neighbors 2, 3, 4 in layer 24.

- Neighbor 6 in layer 22.

So now, for each of these coordinates, we need to find the corresponding number. 

Let me handle them one by one.

First, need a way to convert coordinates to the number. 

Given a coordinate (x, y, z), which is on layer d = max(|x|, |y|, |z|). The number can be determined by how many numbers are in layers 0 to d-1, plus the position within layer d.

But also, within layer d, the position depends on the direction and step. 

But how to map (x, y, z) to a specific position in the spiral. 

Since layer d has 6*d numbers. The total numbers up to layer d-1 is 1 + 3*(d-1)*d. 

But for a given coordinate in layer d, we need to find where it is located in the spiral path (i.e., which direction and step in that direction), then compute the number accordingly. 

First, for each neighbor coordinate, determine its layer, then determine its position within that layer (which direction and step), then calculate the number.

Let me start with the first neighbor: (1, -23, 22). This is in layer 23.

First, total numbers up to layer 22 is 1 + 3*22*23 = 1 + 1518 = 1519. So numbers in layer 23 start at 1520.

Now, need to find the position of (1, -23, 22) within layer 23. 

For a coordinate in layer d, it lies along one of the six directions. Let's see. The coordinate (1, -23, 22) can be seen as a certain number of steps along a certain direction. 

For example, in axial coordinates, this can be represented. Let's see which direction this is. 

The direction can be determined by the largest coordinate. For cube coordinates, the direction can be determined based on which coordinate is the maximum or minimum. 

But since it's in layer d=23, the maximum absolute value is 23. Looking at (1, -23, 22), the -23 is the y-coordinate, which is -d. 

This suggests that it is along direction that decreases the y-coordinate. 

Looking at the six directions:

Each direction corresponds to a specific vector. For example, direction 2 is (0, -1, 1). So moving in direction 2 decreases y and increases z. 

Looking at the coordinate (1, -23, 22). To see which direction it is along, we can check if it is along one of the six direction vectors scaled by some step.

Let me check for each direction:

For a coordinate to be along direction d and step k, it should be k times the direction vector.

For example, direction 0 vector is (1, 0, -1). If the coordinate is (k, 0, -k).

But our neighbor (1, -23, 22) doesn't match this.

Direction 1 vector (1, -1, 0). If the coordinate is (k, -k, 0). Not here.

Direction 2 vector (0, -1, 1). If coordinate is (0, -k, k). Here, (0, -23, 23). But our neighbor is (1, -23, 22). It's close to (0, -23, 23) but shifted by (1, 0, -1). So that suggests it's one step in direction 0 from the end of direction 2 in layer 23.

Similarly, the coordinate (0, -23, 23) is the end of direction 2 in layer 23 (step 23). Then adding one step in direction 0 would give (0 + 1, -23 + 0, 23 - 1) = (1, -23, 22), which is our neighbor. 

Therefore, this coordinate is located at the end of direction 2 in layer 23, plus one step in direction 0. Which corresponds to the start of direction 0 for layer 24. But since we are in layer 23, it must be within layer 23. 

Therefore, this coordinate is at the corner between direction 2 and direction 0 in layer 23. 

In terms of position within layer 23, it's the last number of direction 2 (position 23 in direction 2) and the first number of direction 0 for layer 24. Wait, but since layer 24 hasn't been constructed yet. 

But how does this translate into the position within layer 23? It's at the end of direction 2 of layer 23. 

In layer d, each direction has d steps. The end of direction 2 is at position 2d (since directions are 0-5, each of d numbers). Wait, for layer d, direction 0: positions 1-d; direction 1: d+1 - 2d; ... direction 2: 2d+1 - 3d. Wait no, for layer d, total numbers in the layer is 6d. Each direction has d numbers, so:

- Direction 0: 1 to d

- Direction 1: d+1 to 2d

- Direction 2: 2d+1 to 3d

- Direction 3: 3d+1 to 4d

- Direction 4: 4d+1 to 5d

- Direction 5: 5d+1 to 6d.

Therefore, the end of direction 2 is at position 3d in the layer. Therefore, for layer 23, the end of direction 2 is at position 3*23=69.

Therefore, the number corresponding to the coordinate (0, -23, 23) is the 69th number in layer 23. 

Since total numbers up to layer 22 is 1519, the number at this coordinate is 1519 + 69 = 1588. 

Then, our neighbor coordinate (1, -23, 22) is one step before that in the spiral. Wait, direction 0 of layer 24 starts at the end of layer 23. But since we are in layer 23, the neighbor is part of layer 23? Wait, no, the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is in layer 23. How does it relate to the layer's positions?

Alternatively, since we have determined that the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is one step in direction 0 away from the end of layer 23 direction 2, then it is the previous number in the spiral before reaching the end of direction 2. Therefore, it is the 69 - 1 = 68th number in layer 23? Wait, no. 

When moving through layer 23, after finishing direction 2, you move to direction 0 for layer 24. However, the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is part of layer 23. How is it positioned?

Perhaps it's in direction 3 of layer 23? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's in the last step of direction 2 of layer 23, but since moving in direction 0 would take it out of the layer.

Alternatively, this coordinate is not on the same side of the hexagon as direction 2, but on the adjacent side.

Wait, since we are at the end of direction 2 of layer 23, the next number in the spiral is the start of direction 0 of layer 24, which is outside layer 23. But our neighbor is within layer 23. Therefore, perhaps the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is the last step of direction 3 of layer 23? Or how?

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me note that for any coordinate (x, y, z) in layer d, we can find which direction it is along by looking at its coordinates.

For example, the coordinate (1, -23, 22). Let's consider that to be on the boundary between two directions. But perhaps we can compute the direction by seeing which component is maximal.

Since it's in layer d=23, one of the coordinates must be d or -d. Here, y = -23 is -d, so that suggests that it's along the direction which decreases y. 

Looking at the direction vectors that affect the y-coordinate:

Direction 0: (1, 0, -1): no change in y except through z.

Direction 1: (1, -1, 0): decreases y by 1.

Direction 2: (0, -1, 1): decreases y by 1.

Direction 3: (-1, 0, 1): no change in y.

Direction 4: (-1, 1, 0): increases y.

Direction 5: (0, 1, -1): increases y.

Therefore, directions that decrease y are 1 and 2. Our coordinate has y = -23. Let's see if it's along direction 1 or 2.

For direction 1: after k steps, the coordinate would be (k, -k, 0). But our coordinate is (1, -23, 22). If k=23 for direction 1, we get (23, -23, 0). Which is not our coordinate. 

For direction 2: after k steps, it's (0, -k, k). If k=23, (0, -23, 23). Our coordinate is (1, -23, 22). Which is direction 2's k=23 step (0, -23, 23) moved one step in direction 0. 

Therefore, the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is adjacent to the end of direction 2 of layer 23. 

But how is it positioned in the spiral? 

When constructing layer 23, after completing direction 2 (ending at (0, -23, 23)), the next direction is direction 3. But before moving to direction 3, the next step would be outside of layer 23. But how is the position (1, -23, 22) reached?

Actually, when moving along direction 2, each step is adding (0, -1, 1). So starting from some position, you add this vector each step. However, for layer 23, direction 2 starts from the end of direction 1. 

This is getting too involved. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of the neighbor, perhaps compute the number based on coordinates using the formula that relates coordinates to numbers. 

There is a formula for numbering based on hexagonal spiral coordinates. 

Alternatively, note that numbers along a certain direction in layer d can be calculated.

For example, the numbers along direction 2 in layer d are numbers from:

Start of direction 2: 1 + 3*(d-1)*(d) + 2d + 1 ?

Wait, no. Wait total numbers up to layer d-1 is T = 1 + 3*(d-1)*d. Layer d has 6d numbers. The start of direction 0 in layer d is T + 1. Start of direction 1 is T + d + 1. Start of direction 2 is T + 2d + 1. And so on.

For layer 23, T = 1 + 3*(22)*(23) = 1 + 1518 = 1519. Start of direction 0 is 1520, direction 1: 1520 + 23 = 1543, direction 2: 1543 + 23 = 1566. So numbers in direction 2 of layer 23 are from 1566 to 1566 + 22 = 1588. Wait, direction 2 has 23 numbers, so from 1566 to 1566 + 22 = 1588? Wait no, 1566 to 1566 + 23 - 1 = 1588. Correct.

So the end of direction 2 is 1588, which is the coordinate (0, -23, 23). So neighbor coordinate (1, -23, 22) is adjacent to this number. Since it's one step before direction 0 of the next layer, it might be the previous number in the spiral, but how is that embedded in layer 23?

Alternatively, maybe it is the last number of direction 3 of layer 23? Let me see. 

If direction 3 starts at T + 3d + 1 = 1519 + 69 + 1 = 1519 + 69 + 1? Wait T is 1519. Start of direction 3 is T + 3d + 1? No.

Wait, for layer d, start of direction 0: T + 1,

direction 1: T + d + 1,

direction 2: T + 2d + 1,

direction 3: T + 3d + 1,

direction 4: T + 4d + 1,

direction 5: T + 5d + 1.

But each direction has d numbers. So for direction 3 in layer d, numbers go from T + 3d + 1 to T + 4d.

For d=23, direction 3 starts at 1519 + 69 + 1 = 1589. 

But our neighbor coordinate (1, -23, 22) is in layer 23. It must be in one of the directions 0-5 for layer 23.

Given that it's adjacent to the end of direction 2 (1588), maybe it's the start of direction 3? Or how?

Wait, when you finish direction 2 in layer 23, you are at coordinate (0, -23, 23). To move to direction 3, you would take the first step in direction 3, which is vector (-1, 0, 1). So new coordinate is (0 -1, -23 + 0, 23 + 1) = (-1, -23, 24). Which is in layer 24, not layer 23. Therefore, the previous coordinate (1, -23, 22) is one step in the opposite direction from the end of layer 23 direction 2. Since we can't go outside the layer, it must be part of layer 23. How?

Actually, maybe it's the penultimate step in direction 2 of layer 23. The last step of direction 2 is at step 23, giving (0, -23, 23). The previous step, step 22, would be (0, -22, 22). But wait, (0, -23, 22) is different. Wait, no. Starting from the beginning of direction 2 in layer 23 (coordinate (0, -1, 1) after 1 step, then (0, -2, 2) after 2 steps,... at step k, (0, -k, k). Therefore, at step 23, it is (0, -23, 23). Therefore, the step before that, step 22, would be (0, -22, 22). But our coordinate is (1, -23, 22), which is different. 

So how is this coordinate achieved? It's not part of the direction 2 steps. It must be part of another direction.

Perhaps it's part of direction 5? Let me check. 

Alternatively, think about the six neighbors of the number at (0, -23, 23) which is 1588. We just said one of its neighbors is (1, -23, 22). How to find what number is at (1, -23, 22). 

Alternatively, since the neighbors are adjacent in the grid, their numbers are adjacent or follow some relation based on the spiral. 

But if it's adjacent to 1588, then it could be 1588 + 1 or something else depending on the spiral path. But need to know the order.

When constructing layer 23, after placing number 1588 (end of direction 2), the next number would be the start of direction 3 of layer 23? No, because the next number would actually be the start of direction 0 of layer 24, since layer 23 has been completed. 

Therefore, the number before 1588 in the spiral would be 1587, which is the penultimate step in direction 2 of layer 23, at coordinate (0, -22, 22). But the coordinate (1, -23, 22) is different. Therefore, maybe this coordinate is not in layer 23? But we calculated it belongs to layer 23. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the neighbor coordinates:

For (0, -23, 23) number is 1588. Its neighbor at (1, -23, 22) is... How is this reached? It's one step from (0, -23, 23) in direction 0. But since the spiral is going around counterclockwise, maybe that direction is already outside the layer. Hence, maybe the neighbor is not in the same layer but in a different one. Wait, but we said it is in layer 23. Confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe it is part of layer 23 but in a different direction. For instance, in direction 4? 

Alternatively, consider that (1, -23, 22) is part of direction 3 of layer 23. Let's see:

Direction 3 vector is (-1, 0, 1). If we take steps in direction 3, starting from some point. But where does direction 3 start?

Direction 3 in layer 23 starts after direction 2 ends. But direction 3 starts at the end of direction 2 plus one step in direction 3? Or no, because the start of direction 3 is determined by the end of direction 2. 

Actually, the start of direction 3 in layer 23 is at the end of direction 2 of layer 23. But if we move one step in direction 3 from there, we get to a new coordinate, which would be in layer 24. However, if we move one step in the opposite direction of direction 3 from the end of direction 2, we get to the previous step, which would still be in layer 23.

Wait, the end of direction 2 is at (0, -23, 23). The previous step in direction 2 would be (0, -22, 22), as mentioned earlier, which is number 1587. To get from 1587 to 1588, you add one step in direction 2, resulting in (0, -23, 23).

The neighbor (1, -23, 22) is obtained by moving from (0, -23, 23) in direction 0, which is adding (1, 0, -1). This is not along the same direction of layer 23. It seems to be part of another path. 

But in the spiral, this would only happen if it's the start of the next layer, but since we're in layer 23, it's unclear. This suggests that my previous assumption that coordinates directly map to layer's directions might not capture all neighboring relationships, or that some neighbors are in different layers.

Wait, but each neighbor is either in the same layer, previous layer, or next layer. Given that our original number is in layer 26, the neighbor in layer 22 is straightforward. Others are in layers 23 and 24.

For the neighbor (1, -23, 22) which is in layer 23, perhaps I need to calculate its number differently. 

Let me consider that for any coordinate, we can calculate its distance from the center, d, and then find its position in the spiral for that layer.

But for coordinate (1, -23, 22), distance d is 23. 

To find which direction it is in layer 23, we need to see which direction vector it follows. 

Let me consider that for each coordinate in layer d, it can be represented as starting from the center, and moving certain steps in different directions. But it's complicated.

Alternatively, use the following approach: the number corresponding to a coordinate (x, y, z) can be computed based on its distance from center, d, and its position within the layer.

For that, we need to know in which direction and step of the layer the coordinate falls.

Given (x, y, z), to determine its position in the layer, we can check which of the six directions it belongs to.

For example, for layer d=23, coordinate (1, -23, 22). Let's analyze which direction this is.

Looking at the six directions:

1. Direction 0: x increases, z decreases.

2. Direction 1: x increases, y decreases.

3. Direction 2: y decreases, z increases.

4. Direction 3: x decreases, z increases.

5. Direction 4: x decreases, y increases.

6. Direction 5: y increases, z decreases.

For our coordinate (1, -23, 22), let's see:

- It has y = -23, the minimum y-coordinate in this layer.

- It has x = 1, which is small compared to d=23.

- It has z = 22, close to 23.

This suggests it is on the side of the hexagon where y is minimized, and it is slightly offset in x and z. This corresponds to the direction where y decreases, which is directions 1 and 2.

For direction 1, the decrease in y is accompanied by increase in x. For direction 2, decrease in y is accompanied by increase in z. 

Our coordinate has both y decreased and z increased, which matches direction 2. However, it also has x = 1, which is not part of the pure direction 2 movement. This suggests it is on the edge between direction 2 and direction 0.

Alternatively, it's in direction 1? For direction 1, the x increases and y decreases. Let's see: if it were k steps in direction 1, then x = k, y = -k + something? Wait, starting from the center, after k steps in direction 1, the coordinate is (k, -k, 0). Our coordinate is (1, -23, 22). If k=1, then (1, -1, 0). Not matching. If k=23, then (23, -23, 0). Not matching. So no, it's not along direction 1.

For direction 2, as we said, k steps give (0, -k, k). Our coordinate is (1, -23, 22). It's close to (0, -23, 23) which is k=23 in direction 2. So it's like moving one step in direction 0 from there. So this coordinate is not along direction 2, but adjacent to it. 

Therefore, it might not be in any of the primary directions of the layer, but at a corner. However, every coordinate in the grid must be in some direction of some layer.

Alternatively, maybe it's in direction 5 of layer 23?

Let me think: direction 5's vector is (0, 1, -1). So moving in direction 5 decreases z and increases y. But our coordinate has y decreased, so unlikely.

Direction 3: vector (-1, 0, 1). It decreases x and increases z. Our coordinate increases z from 22 to 23 in direction 2, but here it is 22. Not sure.

This is really tricky. Maybe there's a mathematical way to determine the direction. 

In axial coordinates, another way to represent the directions. But maybe using the axial coordinates (q, r) with s = -q - r. 

Given cube coordinate (x, y, z) = (1, -23, 22). Axial coordinates could be (q, r) = (x, y). But I'm not sure about the exact mapping. 

Alternatively, converting to axial coordinates, where q = x, r = z. Then axial coordinates (q, r) = (1, 22). In axial coordinates, the six directions are (1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1). 

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, using the formula from the article on axial coordinates, but I need to recall.

Alternatively, I can refer to the fact that for any hex grid, the number of steps in a certain direction from the center is related to the layer and position.

Given that the coordinate is (1, -23, 22), and it's in layer 23, we can imagine that it is 23 steps from the center in some fashion. 

The distance from center in cube coordinates is max(|x|, |y|, |z|). So here, it's 23.

To find the number, let's consider that it's on the "south" side of the hexagon, since y=-23. 

On the south side, moving from west to east, there are numbers from direction 2 to direction 3. Our coordinate is slightly east of the southwest point of the hexagon.

Let me consider that on the south edge (y = -d), the x-coordinate ranges from -d to d, and z = d - x. 

Wait, given that y = -d = -23, then x + z = 23 (since x + y + z = 0). So z = 23 - x. 

Our coordinate has x=1, z=22, which satisfies z=23 - x. Therefore,
