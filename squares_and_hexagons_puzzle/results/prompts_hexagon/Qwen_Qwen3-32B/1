Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a hexagonal spiral of natural numbers, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026. Hmm, first, I need to understand how the hexagonal spiral works. From the given example:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

Looking at this, it seems like numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid, spiraling out from the center. The center is number 1. Then, moving outward in a spiral. So, unlike a square spiral, which has four directions, a hexagonal spiral has six directions, which creates a different pattern.

First, maybe I need to figure out the general formula for the numbers on the spiral and how their positions relate. In square spirals, the numbers on the layers are determined by the side length of the square, but for hexagonal spirals, it's a bit different.

In a hexagonal grid, each layer adds a ring of hexagons around the center. The number of numbers in each ring can be calculated. For a hexagonal grid, the number of cells in each concentric layer around the center is given by 6*n, where n is the layer number. For example, the first layer (n=1) has 6*1=6 cells, the second layer (n=2) has 6*2=12 cells, etc. So the total number of numbers up to layer n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). 

Wait, let me verify that. If we consider layers as the number of rings away from the center. The center is 1, then the first ring around it has 6 numbers, then the next ring has 12 numbers, each adding 6 more. So cumulative numbers up to layer k is 1 + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... + 6*k = 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1). 

So for example, the center is layer 0: total numbers is 1. Layer 1 (first ring): 1 + 3*1*(1+1) = 1 + 6 = 7. Wait, but that would mean the first ring adds 6 numbers. Let me check: the numbers from 2 to 7 would be the first ring? Wait, 1 is center. Then numbers 2-7 would be the first ring? But according to the given example, number 2 is adjacent to 1. So maybe the first ring is numbers 2-7. Then the next ring is numbers 8-19 (since next layer adds 12 numbers: 6*2). Let's see, total numbers up to layer 1 is 7, so layer 2 adds 12 numbers, total becomes 7 + 12 = 19. Then layer 3 adds 18 numbers, total becomes 19 + 18 = 37. And so on.

So, if we can find in which layer the number 2026 is located, that would help. Then figure out its position in that layer, and find its neighbors.

First, let me find the layer in which 2026 is located. Let me denote the total numbers up to layer k is T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1). So, we can solve for k such that T(k-1) < 2026 ≤ T(k). So:

Find k where 1 + 3(k-1)k < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3k(k+1)

Let me compute T(k) for some k:

Trying k=25: T(25)=1 + 3*25*26= 1 + 3*650= 1 + 1950=1951

k=25: total number is 1951. So 2026 is larger than that. Then check T(26)=1 + 3*26*27= 1 + 3*702= 1 + 2106=2107. So 2026 is between T(25)=1951 and T(26)=2107. Therefore, 2026 is in layer k=26. The numbers in layer 26 start from T(25)+1=1952 up to T(26)=2107.

So the position of 2026 within layer 26 is: pos=2026 - T(25)=2026 - 1951=75. So it's the 75th number in layer 26. Since each layer has 6*k numbers, for k=26, that's 6*26=156 numbers. So the numbers in layer 26 go from 1 to 156 positions. Our 2026 is the 75th.

Now, how are these numbers arranged in the layer? In a hexagonal spiral, each layer can be divided into six "sides" or "arms", each of length k. Since each layer adds a ring around the previous one. So for each layer k, there are six sides, each side has k numbers. So the first side has numbers from (previous total) +1 to (previous total)+k, then next side k numbers, etc. So for layer k=26, each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, the 75th position in the layer would be in which side?

Since each side has 26 numbers, divide 75 by 26: 75 / 26 ≈ 2.88. So 2 full sides, which is 2*26=52, and the remaining is 75-52=23. Therefore, the third side, position 23. Therefore, the coordinates or the direction?

Wait, but I need to figure out where exactly the 75th element is. To figure out the neighbors, I need to know its position in the hexagonal grid. Let me think.

In a hex grid, coordinates can be represented in axial or cube coordinates, but maybe for this problem, since it's about neighbors, maybe I need to figure out the relative positions.

Alternatively, considering that each side of the hexagon corresponds to moving in a certain direction. For each layer, the numbers go around the hexagon, starting from some direction, say, east, then northeast, then northwest, etc. Let me try to imagine the spiral.

The spiral starts at the center with 1. Then goes out in one direction, let's say east, building up the spiral. For the first ring (layer 1), going clockwise around the center. Each side of the ring has k numbers. So for example, layer 1 (k=1) has six sides each with 1 number. The numbers go as follows: starting from the east position (number 2), then northeast (number 3), then northwest (number 4), then west (number 5), then southwest (number 6), then southeast (number 7). Then back to center? Not sure. Maybe.

But the exact direction depends on how the spiral is constructed. Since the example shows:

In the example given:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

Looking at the top part: 14, 4, 3, 10... the number 1 is in the middle. Then moving clockwise? Let me try to reconstruct the spiral up to 16.

Starting with 1 at center. Let's assume the first layer (around 1) is numbers 2-7. Then second layer 8-19, as mentioned. The third layer would be 20-37. The given numbers in the example show up to 16, which is in the second layer (since layer 1 ends at 7, layer 2 ends at 19). 

Looking at the example rows:

The second row (middle) has ... 15 5 1 2 9 ... So going from left to right, it's 15 (which is in layer 2?), then 5 (layer 1), 1 (center), 2 (layer1), 9 (layer2). 

Similarly, the first row above is ...14 4 3 10... So 14,4,3,10. From the numbers 4,3 are layer1, 10 is layer2. The numbers 14 is layer2? 

So perhaps the spiral moves in a way that after completing a layer, moves to the next direction.

In square spirals, the directions alternate between right, up, left, down, etc. In hexagonal spirals, with six directions, the movement is more complex. However, perhaps the general idea is similar to square spirals but with six arms. 

But maybe there is a way to figure out a coordinate system. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find formulas for the neighbors. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. Given a number, its neighbors depend on where it's located in the spiral. However, if I can find the coordinates of the number, I can compute its neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a relationship between numbers and their positions. For example, in square spirals, there are formulas for the coordinates based on the layer. For hexagonal spirals, perhaps a similar approach.

First, let me think about the coordinates. In the axial coordinate system for hex grids, each hexagon can be represented by coordinates (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0 (cube coordinates). Alternatively, axial coordinates with (q, r). However, maybe for this problem, it's more useful to think about the distance from the center and the direction.

Alternatively, since each layer corresponds to a distance from the center. For example, the number 1 is at distance 0, numbers 2-7 are at distance 1, 8-19 at distance 2, etc. So 2026 is in distance 26 from the center.

But how to translate this into coordinates? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps think of the numbers at each corner of the layer. For example, the numbers at the "turning points" of each layer.

In square spirals, the corners have specific numbers. Maybe in hexagonal spirals, similar properties exist.

Alternatively, think of the numbers on the six spokes radiating out from the center. Each layer has six spokes. For example, starting from the center, going east, which in layer 1 ends at number 2, then the next spoke (northeast) ends at number 3, etc. Similarly, in layer k, each spoke ends at a specific number. For example, in layer k, each spoke has k numbers, so the numbers at the ends of each spoke are the numbers that start a new side.

Alternatively, the first number of layer k is adjacent to the last number of layer k-1. For example, layer 1 starts at 2 (first number after 1). Then layer 2 starts at 8. Wait, let's check:

Total numbers up to layer 1: 7. So layer 2 starts at 8. Total numbers in layer 2: 12 numbers (from 8 to 19). So in layer 2, the six sides each have 2 numbers. The numbers at the ends of each side would be numbers like 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. Wait, layer 2 has 12 numbers. If each of the 6 sides has 2 numbers, then the first side is numbers 8 and 9, next side numbers 10 and 11, then 12 and 13, 14 and 15, 16 and 17, 18 and 19? Wait, but 6 sides times 2 numbers each is 12 numbers. However, in the example, the number 9 is in the middle row as 9 at the end, so maybe after the first side (8-9), then next side (10-11), etc. 

But perhaps in general, for layer n, each side has n numbers, and the first number of layer n is T(n-1) + 1, where T(n-1) is the total numbers up to previous layer. For layer 26, that's T(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1=1952. And the numbers on each side go from starting number to starting + n -1. So each side of layer 26 has numbers from starting + (side-1)*26 to starting + side*26 -1.

But since our 2026 is in layer 26 at position 75, and since each side has 26 numbers, as we found earlier, it's on the third side, position 23. Wait, first side: positions 1-26, second side 27-52, third side 53-78, so position 75 is 75-52=23rd number in the third side.

So if we can figure out the direction of this third side, then we can determine where 2026 is located with respect to that side, and then find its neighbors.

But perhaps we need to figure out what direction each side is in. Assuming that the layers are built by moving clockwise around the hexagon, starting with a particular direction.

In the example, the first side of layer 1 (k=1) goes from number 2 to number 2. Then the next side is from number 3, etc. Wait, maybe the first side is moving east, then next northeast, then northwest, then west, then southwest, then southeast, to complete the ring. But the exact directions depend on the spiral's construction.

But since the problem is about neighbors, maybe each number has six neighbors: one in each direction. However, to compute the neighbors of 2026, we need to know the numbers adjacent to it, which depends on its position in the spiral.

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the neighbors based on its position in the layer.

Alternatively, let me think about how numbers are placed on the hexagonal spiral. Let me try to reconstruct the coordinates for numbers in the spiral.

An approach I can think of is to assign coordinates to the numbers, based on their axial coordinates (q, r). In axial coordinates for hex grids, each hexagon has neighbors in six directions:

Direction 0: +q, -r

Direction 1: +q, +s = +q, -(q + r)

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, there is a coordinate system called axial, with coordinates (x, y), where each hex has six neighbors.

Alternatively, I can model the spiral as follows:

Start at the origin (0, 0) for number 1. Then, each layer k consists of moving in a certain direction for k steps, turning direction, etc.

But perhaps for a hexagonal spiral, the movement is similar to a square spiral, but with six directions instead of four. So, for example, the spiral could proceed by going in direction A for k steps, then turning 60 degrees, direction B for k steps, then turning 60 degrees again, etc., for six directions per layer. 

But how to model this in coordinates?

Alternatively, there is a way to map numbers to their axial coordinates based on the layer and position in the layer. For example, in each layer, the numbers are placed along the six directions.

Alternatively, here's an idea from square spirals: in square spirals, the coordinates depend on the side of the square you're on. Similarly, in hexagonal spirals, the coordinates depend on which side of the hexagon you are on. 

Let me consider that. So for layer k, each side has k numbers. Our number is on the third side of layer k=26, position 23 along that side. If I can figure out the coordinates of the start of that side, then moving along the side for 23-1 steps would give me the coordinates of 2026.

First, what is the starting point of each side?

Assuming the spiral goes in a certain order. Let's define the order of the directions. For simplicity, let's assume that each layer starts by moving east, then turns 60 degrees (northeast), another 60 (northwest), then west, southwest, southeast, to complete the hexagon. 

But to define coordinates, let's use axial coordinates where moving east is (q, r) = (+1, 0), moving northeast is (0, +1), moving northwest is (-1, +1), etc. Wait, actually different axial coordinate systems can be used. Let me recall:

In axial coordinates, there are three axes, but usually, two coordinates are used to represent positions. Each hexagon can be represented with coordinates (q, r), where the third coordinate s = -q - r. 

The six directions in axial coordinates can be represented as:

Direction 0: ( +1,  0 )

Direction 1: ( +1, -1 )

Direction 2: (  0, -1 )

Direction 3: ( -1,  0 )

Direction 4: ( -1, +1 )

Direction 5: (  0, +1 )

Wait, let me check this. If we consider axial coordinates, the six directions are as follows. However, I might need to confirm the exact directions. 

Alternatively, here's a reference for axial coordinates:

Each direction can be represented as:

EAST: (+1, -1)

NORTHEAST: (+1, 0)

NORTHWEST: (0, +1)

WEST: (-1, +1)

SOUTHWEST: (-1, 0)

SOUTHEAST: (0, -1)

But different sources might define them differently. Maybe I need to be careful here. For our purposes, perhaps the exact coordinate system isn't important, as long as I can define the movement.

Alternatively, maybe I can use cube coordinates (x, y, z) with x + y + z = 0, which are easier to handle for neighbors. Each hex can be represented with three coordinates, but constrained to x + y + z = 0. The six directions are then the six possible permutations of (+1, -1, 0). For example, moving in the six directions:

( +1, -1, 0 )

( +1,  0, -1 )

(  0, +1, -1 )

( -1, +1,  0 )

( -1,  0, +1 )

(  0, -1, +1 )

These correspond to the six directions in cube coordinates. Now, if we can figure out the cube coordinates of the number, we can find the neighbors by adding/subtracting these direction vectors.

So, assuming that, let's try to model the spiral as moving in these directions.

But how does the spiral progress? Let me try to reconstruct the spiral for the first few layers.

Starting at center, which is (0, 0, 0).

Layer 1 (k=1): moving in direction 0 for 1 step, then direction 1 for 1 step, etc. 

Wait, let me think about how a spiral would be constructed. In a square spiral, you move right, up, left, down, repeating, increasing the length every two turns. In a hexagonal spiral, maybe the length increases every 6 turns? Wait, but in our case, each layer k has 6*k numbers, each side of the layer has length k. So to create the spiral, after completing a full layer (6 sides with k steps each), you increase k by 1 for the next layer.

Therefore, the spiral is constructed by starting at center, then moving in direction 0 for 1 step (layer 1), then direction 1 for 1 step, ..., direction 5 for 1 step, then for layer 2, moving direction 0 for 2 steps, direction 1 for 2 steps, ..., direction 5 for 2 steps, etc. 

Assuming that the directions are labeled 0 through 5 in a clockwise manner.

So let me define direction 0 as moving towards the first direction, say, the positive x-axis in cube coordinates? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of starting direction. 

Assume that the first step from the center is in direction 0: (1, -1, 0). Let me check if this works.

Starting at center (0,0,0). Number 1 is here.

Layer 1 (k=1):

Move direction 0 (let's say direction for x+) for 1 step: to (1, -1, 0), which is number 2.

Then direction 1 for 1 step: from there, direction 1 would be another direction. But need to figure out the direction sequence. Since it's a spiral, after moving in direction 0, you turn clockwise to direction 1, then direction 2, etc.

But in cube coordinates, the sequence of directions might be direction 0 through 5 as above. But need to figure out what direction comes next after direction 0.

Assuming that the directions are ordered in a way that turning is clockwise. Let me assign directions as follows:

Let me consider:

Direction 0: East, (1, -1, 0)

Direction 1: Northeast, (1, 0, -1)

Direction 2: Northwest, (0, 1, -1)

Direction 3: West, (-1, 1, 0)

Direction 4: Southwest, (-1, 0, 1)

Direction 5: Southeast, (0, -1, 1)

Then turning clockwise would be direction 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0...

If that's the case, then when building the spiral, after completing each side, we turn clockwise to the next direction.

So starting at center (0,0,0), number 1.

Layer 1 (k=1):

Start moving in direction 0 for 1 step:

Number 2: (0,0,0) + direction 0 = (1, -1, 0)

Then direction 1 for 1 step:

Number 3: (1, -1, 0) + direction 1 = (1 + 1, -1 + 0, 0 + -1) = (2, -1, -1). Wait, but cube coordinates must satisfy x + y + z = 0. Let me check: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0. Yes, okay.

Then direction 2 for 1 step:

Number 4: (2, -1, -1) + direction 2 (which is (0, 1, -1)? Wait:

Wait, direction 2 is (0, 1, -1)? Wait, in cube coordinates, each direction is (x, y, z). Let me recheck:

Earlier, I listed:

Direction 0: (+1, -1, 0)

Direction 1: (+1, 0, -1)

Direction 2: (0, +1, -1)

Direction 3: (-1, +1, 0)

Direction 4: (-1, 0, +1)

Direction 5: (0, -1, +1)

Yes, so for direction 2, the vector is (0, +1, -1). Therefore, adding that to (2, -1, -1) would give:

x: 2 + 0 = 2

y: -1 + 1 = 0

z: -1 + (-1) = -2? Wait no, the direction vector is (0, +1, -1), so adding to current (x, y, z):

Current x: 2, current y: -1, current z: -1

New x: 2 + 0 = 2

New y: (-1) + 1 = 0

New z: (-1) + (-1) = -2? Wait, but x + y + z should be 0. 2 + 0 + (-2) = 0. Yes. So number 4 is at (2, 0, -2).

Then direction 3 for 1 step:

Direction 3 is (-1, +1, 0). So adding that to (2, 0, -2):

x: 2 + (-1) = 1

y: 0 + 1 = 1

z: -2 + 0 = -2. Check sum: 1 + 1 + (-2) = 0. Okay. So number 5 is (1, 1, -2).

Then direction 4 for 1 step:

Direction 4 is (-1, 0, +1). Adding to (1, 1, -2):

x: 1 -1 = 0

y: 1 + 0 = 1

z: -2 + 1 = -1

Check sum: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0. Okay. So number 6 is (0, 1, -1).

Then direction 5 for 1 step:

Direction 5 is (0, -1, +1). Adding to (0, 1, -1):

x: 0 + 0 = 0

y: 1 + (-1) = 0

z: -1 + 1 = 0. So number 7 is (0, 0, 0). Wait, but that's the center! But we already have number 1 at (0,0,0). This seems like a problem. Wait, that would mean number 7 is overlapping with the center. Which contradicts the example, because in the example, number 7 is adjacent to number 8, which is in the next layer. Therefore, my direction assignments must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the order of directions is different. Because if we follow the direction 0 to 5 as above, moving in direction 5 returns to the center. Which is not correct. The number 7 should be adjacent to the numbers that start the next layer. So perhaps my direction order is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence of directions is not 0 through 5, but another order. Maybe after moving in direction 0, the next direction is not direction 1, but another direction?

Alternatively, maybe the spiral doesn't return to the same place after one full layer. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe my directions are not correctly ordered. Let me think again about the directions.

In the example given:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

Looking at the numbers 4, 3, 10 in the first row. Number 1 is in the middle, surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Then numbers like 8,9,10, etc. are in the next layer.

From 7 to 8, the direction is...? In the example, moving from 7 to 8 is to the west? Since in the third row, after 16 ... 6 7 8 ... So number 8 is to the west of number 7? Or maybe south-west?

In the example, number 7 is adjacent to number 8 and number 6. Number 6 is adjacent to number 7 and number 16. So number 8 is adjacent to number 7 and 9.

So if I look at number 7, it's connected to 6, 8, 1, 2 (looking at the numbers in the example). Wait, number 7 is adjacent to numbers 6, 8, and maybe others? But in the given example, number 7 is between 6 and 8, and also adjacent to 1 and 2? Wait, looking at the arrangement:

The middle row is ...15 5 1 2 9... So number 1 is adjacent to 5, 2, and 6,7? Wait. The middle row has ...15 5 1 2 9 ... So directly above this row is ... 14 4 3 10... and below it is ...16 6 7 8...

Therefore, number 1 is adjacent to:

To the left: 5? Wait, no. Number 1 is in the middle row. Looking at the middle row, from left to right: ..., 15, 5, 1, 2, 9, ...

Above it, the row is ..., 14, 4, 3, 10...

Below it is ...,16, 6, 7, 8...

Therefore, the neighbors of 1 are: above left is 4? Wait, in hex grids, each cell has six neighbors. Let me visualize.

Assuming a hex grid, the cell with 1 is in the middle. In the middle row: ...15, 5, 1, 2, 9...

Above that row, shifted left: ...14, 4, 3, 10...

And below, shifted right: ...16, 6, 7, 8...

So in a hex grid, the cell north of 1 would be 3, the cell northeast would be 2, the cell east is 9, southeast is 8, south is 7, southwest is 6, west is 5, northwest is 4?

Wait, but each cell has six neighbors. Let me try:

For the central cell (1):

Looking at the layout:

Row 1 (top): ... 14 [A] 4 [B] 3 [C] 10 ...

Row 2 (middle): ... 15 [D] 5 [E] 1 [F] 2 [G] 9 ...

Row 3 (bottom): ... 16 [H] 6 [I] 7 [J] 8 [K]...

Assuming that each row is offset. In hex grids, even and odd rows may be offset. Assuming that Row 2 is in between Rows 1 and 3.

So the neighbors of 1 (cell F) would be:

Looking at neighboring cells:

- Northwest neighbor: Cell D (5)? If the grid is offset, perhaps cell to the northwest of F is E? Not sure. It's complicated without seeing the actual grid.

Alternatively, perhaps in the example given, the neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Indeed, the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are adjacent to 1. So each of these is one neighbor. So that suggests that after layer 1 (numbers 2-7), the next layer starts at 8. And from 7, moving to 8 is one step in some direction. 

Given that 7 is adjacent to 8 and 6. From the example, 7 is adjacent to 8 and 6, so if we move from 7 in the direction opposite to 6, we get to 8. Since number 6 is adjacent to 7 and 16, and 1 is adjacent to 6. So moving from 7 to 8 would be the next step after completing layer 1. So direction from 7 to 8 is the starting direction for layer 2. 

Given that number 7 is at some position, moving to 8 in some direction. If we can figure out what that direction is, we can model it. 

But since earlier, with my cube coordinates, moving in direction 5 from number 6 (0,1,-1) would add direction 5 (0, -1, +1) to get (0 + 0, 1 + (-1), -1 + 1) = (0, 0, 0), which is overlapping with center. But in reality, number 7 should connect to 8. So there's an error in the direction assignment. 

Perhaps my initial direction assignments are incorrect. Maybe after completing layer 1, instead of turning to direction 5, we turn another direction. Alternatively, maybe the direction order is different. For example, after finishing a side, we turn 60 degrees the other way? Or maybe the spiral goes counterclockwise?

Alternatively, perhaps the order of directions is different. Maybe after direction 0, instead of going to direction 1, it goes to direction 5? Let me think. In square spirals, when you complete a side, you turn right (90 degrees). In a hex spiral, turning 60 degrees each time. Depending on clockwise or counterclockwise.

Suppose we start moving east (direction 0). After completing that side, we turn clockwise (60 degrees), so direction 0 -> direction 1 -> direction 2... etc. But that led to overlapping at number 7. Alternatively, if after completing a side, we turn counterclockwise?

Alternatively, perhaps the error comes from how I defined the directions. Maybe I need to use axial coordinates differently.

Let me look up how hexagonal spirals are usually constructed. Wait, since I can't actually look things up, let me try to think. 

Another approach: for a hexagonal grid, each layer corresponds to a ring around the center. The number of elements in the nth layer is 6n, as established. 

The positions on the ring can be labeled by their position along the six "arms" or sides.

If we consider moving along the six directions, each labeled from 0 to 5, then each side of the layer corresponds to moving in one direction. For example, on layer k, moving along direction 0 for k steps, then direction 1 for k steps, etc.

But to avoid overlapping, the order of directions must be such that after completing the six sides, you are adjacent to the starting point of the next layer.

Alternatively, maybe there is a standard way to generate the hexagonal spiral numbers.

Wait, here's a thought. In square spirals, the top right corner of each layer is (2n+1)^2. Similarly, perhaps in hexagonal spirals, there are specific positions that can be calculated.

But I need a different strategy. Let me think about coordinates.

Let me try to find the coordinates for the numbers in the first layer.

Number 1: (0, 0, 0).

Number 2: Let's say direction is 0. Suppose moving in the direction of (1, 0, -1) in cube coordinates. Wait, no, cube coordinates must satisfy x + y + z = 0. If I move in a direction, I change one coordinate by +1 and another by -1. For example:

If I define the six directions as:

Dir 0: ( +1, -1, 0 )

Dir 1: ( +1, 0, -1 )

Dir 2: ( 0, +1, -1 )

Dir 3: ( -1, +1, 0 )

Dir 4: ( -1, 0, +1 )

Dir 5: ( 0, -1, +1 )

These are the six directions. Starting from center, moving in direction 0 for layer 1 (k=1):

Number 2: (1, -1, 0).

Then direction 1: number 3: (1, -1, 0) + direction 1 (1, 0, -1) = (2, -1, -1).

Direction 2: number 4: (2, -1, -1) + direction 2 (0, 1, -1) = (2, 0, -2).

Direction 3: number 5: (2, 0, -2) + direction 3 (-1, +1, 0) = (1, 1, -2).

Direction 4: number 6: (1, 1, -2) + direction 4 (-1, 0, +1) = (0, 1, -1).

Direction 5: number 7: (0, 1, -1) + direction 5 (0, -1, +1) = (0, 0, 0), which is the center. That's a problem. Therefore, the issue is that following this direction order brings us back to center after finishing the sixth side, which is incorrect because number 7 should be at the end of the first layer and adjacent to the start of the next layer. Therefore, my direction order is flawed.

Perhaps the direction order is counterclockwise instead of clockwise? Let's check. Suppose after direction 0, we turn counterclockwise instead of clockwise. In cube coordinates, turning counterclockwise might involve going to a different direction. For example, if after moving in direction 0, we turn to direction 5 instead of direction 1. Let's try.

So, starting with direction 0 for first side, then direction 5, then direction 4, etc. Let me try this:

Layer 1:

Number 2: (1, -1, 0) [direction 0].

Then direction 5: which is (0, -1, +1). So adding to (1, -1, 0) gives:

x: 1 + 0 = 1

y: -1 + (-1) = -2

z: 0 + 1 = 1. Check sum: 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0. Okay. So number 3: (1, -2, 1).

Next direction? If turning counterclockwise from direction 5, would it be direction 4? Let's assume directions are ordered 0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... for counterclockwise. Let's see.

Number 4: previous position (1, -2, 1) + direction 4 (-1, 0, +1) → (1 -1, -2 + 0, 1 + 1) = (0, -2, 2).

Number 5: + direction 3 (-1, +1, 0): (0 -1, -2 + 1, 2 + 0) = (-1, -1, 2).

Number 6: + direction 2 (0, +1, -1): (-1 + 0, -1 + 1, 2 + (-1)) = (-1, 0, 1).

Number 7: + direction 1 (+1, 0, -1): (-1 + 1, 0 + 0, 1 + (-1)) = (0, 0, 0). Again back to center. Still overlapping. Hmm. Not helpful.

Maybe the issue isn't the direction order, but instead, the starting direction. Perhaps I chose the wrong starting direction? Let's suppose instead that the first move is in a different direction.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinate system should be different. Perhaps using axial coordinates (q, r) without translating to cube coordinates.

In axial coordinates, each hexagon has neighbors in the six directions:

q+1, r

q, r+1

q-1, r+1

q-1, r

q+1, r-1

q, r-1

Wait, different systems have different conventions. Perhaps this is the right way.

Let me look up the standard axial coordinates neighbor directions (from memory). In axial coordinates with q and r, the six neighbors are:

(q+1, r)

(q, r+1)

(q-1, r+1)

(q-1, r)

(q+1, r-1)

(q, r-1)

So these are the six directions. Let's try to model the spiral with these.

Starting from center (0, 0). Layer 1 has 6 numbers. Let's define the spiral movement as follows: starting at (0, 0), then move in direction 0 (say, q+1) for 1 step, then turn direction for next side, etc.

Let me try building layer by layer.

Layer 0: just (0,0).

Layer 1 (k=1):

Start at (0,0).

First side: direction (q+1, r). So starting at (0,0), moving in direction (1, 0). So number 2 is at (1, 0).

Then next side: direction (q, r+1). Moving from (1,0) in that direction for 1 step to (1, 1). Number 3.

Next direction: (q-1, r+1). From (1,1) + (-1, 1)? Wait, the movement is adding the direction vector. The six directions are as addition vectors. So for example:

To move in direction 0: add (1, 0).

Direction 1: add (0, 1).

Direction 2: add (-1, 1).

Direction 3: add (-1, 0).

Direction 4: add (0, -1).

Direction 5: add (1, -1).

Yes, these are the six axial direction vectors.

Assuming the spiral proceeds by going in these directions, turning in a certain order. Let's assume that to make a spiral, after each side, you turn to the next direction in the order 0,1,2,3,4,5, and repeat. Let's try.

Layer 1:

Start at (0,0) [number 1]. 

First side, direction 0 for k=1 step: move to (1, 0) [number 2].

Second side, direction 1 for k=1 step: move to (1, 1) [number 3].

Third side, direction 2 for k=1 step: move to (1, 1) + (-1, 1) = (0, 2) [number 4].

Fourth side, direction 3 for k=1 step: move to (0, 2) + (-1, 0) = (-1, 2) [number 5].

Fifth side, direction 4 for k=1 step: move to (-1, 2) + (0, -1) = (-1, 1) [number 6].

Sixth side, direction 5 for k=1 step: move to (-1, 1) + (1, -1) = (0, 0) [number 7]. Uh-oh, back to center. Same problem as before. Therefore, layer 1 ends with number 7 returning to center, which is not desired. Hence, this suggests that either the direction order is wrong or the turning direction is wrong (clockwise vs counterclockwise).

If instead, after moving along the sides, we turn the other way. Let's try turning counterclockwise. In terms of direction order, instead of 0,1,2,3,4,5, maybe 0,5,4,3,2,1. Let's try:

Layer 1:

Start at (0,0). First side direction 0 for 1 step: number 2 at (1,0).

Next side direction 5: add (1, -1): from (1,0) + (1, -1) = (2, -1) [number 3].

Next side direction 4: add (0, -1): from (2, -1) + (0, -1) = (2, -2) [number 4].

Next side direction 3: add (-1, 0): from (2, -2) + (-1, 0) = (1, -2) [number 5].

Next side direction 2: add (-1, +1): from (1, -2) + (-1, +1) = (0, -1) [number 6].

Next side direction 1: add (0, +1): from (0, -1) + (0, +1) = (0, 0) [number 7]. Again back to center. No good.

Hmm. Same issue. So regardless of turning direction, it returns to center. Therefore, there must be a different issue.

Wait, maybe the number of steps is not k on each side? Wait, in layer 1, k=1, but maybe the last side has k-1 steps? Let me think.

In square spirals, after completing a layer, the next layer starts at a new position. Similarly, maybe here, after completing side 6, we don't go back to center, but start the new layer. Perhaps the error is that in the first layer (k=1), the sixth side doesn't end at the center, but adjacent to it?

Wait, let's think about how to connect layer 1 to layer 2. If the last step of layer 1 is adjacent to the first step of layer 2, then the spiral can be continued. 

For example, in square spiral, after completing one round, you have a gap where the next spiral starts. Maybe similarly here.

Let me try again. Let me forget the coordinate system for a moment and think about how to create a spiral.

Start at 1. To create a hexagonal spiral, you move in one direction, then turn 60 degrees, move, turn 60 degrees, etc., increasing the length every full rotation. Wait, but in our case, each layer has length k. So for layer k, all six sides have length k. But if you follow that, the path would overlap itself. Hence, likely the correct way is that each layer has sides of length k, but after completing the six sides, you are in a position to start the next layer.

But perhaps my previous attempts to model it are error-prone. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Since I need to find the neighbors of 2026, and I know it's in layer 26, position 75 (third side, 23rd step), maybe I can find formulas for the neighbors based on its position.

In hexagonal grids, each hex has neighbors in six directions. Depending on where the number is located in the spiral, its neighbors are:

- The previous and next number in the layer.

- The number in the previous layer in the same direction.

- The number in the next layer in the same direction?

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the numbers adjacent to a given number on the spiral:

- If the number is in the middle of a side, its neighbors are the previous and next numbers in the side, plus numbers adjacent from the previous and next layer.

If the number is at a corner, it will have a neighbor from the next side.

Alternatively, perhaps for a number not at a corner, it has two neighbors on its side of the layer, one from the previous side, and one from the next side, and two from the previous layer.

But this is vague.

Alternatively, think about the numbers in the layer. For layer k, each side has k numbers. If the number is in the middle of a side (not at the corner), then its neighbors on the spiral would be:

- Previous number in the side.

- Next number in the side.

- A number from the previous layer in the same general direction.

- A number from the next layer in the same direction.

But how to calculate these?

Alternatively, use the fact that in the spiral, each number has specific relationships with its neighbors. For example, in square spirals, there are formulas for the differences between neighbors, but I don't know if similar exists for hex spirals.

Wait, another approach: since I know the layer (k=26) and the position within the layer (75), which is on the third side (since 2*26=52, and 75-52=23), and position 23 on that side. Since each side has k numbers, and the third side is from position 53 to 78 in the layer.

Now, if I can figure out what the starting number of each side is, then I can determine what the number before and after 2026 are on that side, and then determine the other neighbors.

For example, the first side of layer 26 starts at 1952 (T(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952). The first side has numbers from 1952 to 1952 + 26 - 1 = 1952 + 25 = 1977.

Second side: 1978 to 1978 + 25 = 2003.

Third side: 2004 to 2004 + 25 = 2029.

Fourth side: 2030 to ... etc.

Wait, the third side of layer 26 is from 2004 to 2029 (since each side has 26 numbers? Wait, earlier we said that layer 26 has 6*26=156 numbers. Each side has 26 numbers. Therefore, starting number of side m is T(25) + 1 + (m-1)*26 = 1952 + 26*(m-1). For m=1: 1952, m=2: 1952 + 26=1978, m=3: 1978 + 26=2004, m=4: 2004 + 26=2030, etc.

So third side: numbers from 2004 to 2004 + 25 = 2029. Our number is 2026, which is in this third side. 

Since 2026 - 2004 + 1 = 23rd number on the third side. So the position on the side is 23.

Now, on a side, each number has neighbors:

- The previous number in the side (2025)

- The next number in the side (2027)

- The number before starting the side (the end of the previous side, which is 1978 + 25 = 1978 + 25 = 2003?)

Wait, no: the previous side is the second side, which ends at 1978 + 25 = 1978 + 25? Wait no: the second side starts at 1978 and has 26 numbers: 1978 to 1978 + 26 - 1 = 1978 + 25 = 2003. Yes. 

So the end of second side is 2003. Then the third side starts at 2004. Now, the start of the third side is adjacent to the end of the second side. Similarly, the end of the third side is adjacent to the start of the fourth side.

Similarly, each number in the third side, except for the first and last, has neighbors from the previous and next sides?

Wait, not sure. Perhaps in the hexagon, each number on a side has neighbors inside the layer (previous and next number) and two neighbors from the previous layer and one from the next?

This is getting too vague. Let me think of specific examples.

Take the example from the beginning. Number 3 in layer 1 (position 2 on the second side? Wait, layer 1: first side starts at 2, second side at 3, third at 4, etc. Wait, no: for layer 1, each side has 1 number. First side (direction 0) has number 2, second side (direction 1) has number 3, third side direction 2 has number 4, fourth side direction 3 has 5, fifth side direction 4 has 6, sixth side direction 5 has 7.

In the example, number 3 is at position 2 on the second side of layer 1. Its neighbors in the spiral would be:

- 2 (previous on the layer)

- 4 (next on the layer)

- 1 (inside previous layer)

And others?

But according to the example, number 3 is adjacent to 1, 2, 4, and others? In the given example, number 3 is between 4 and 10 in the upper row. Wait, in the example, number 3 is adjacent to number 1 and number 4. So in this case, neighbors are 2, 4, 1, and maybe others. But since it's in layer 1, maybe it also has neighbors from outside? But layer 1 is the first ring, surrounded by layer 2.

Wait, number 3 is on the second side of layer 1. If we can find its neighbors, which include numbers from layer 1 and layer 2.

If I assume that each number has one neighbor from the next layer, then maybe the first number on a side is adjacent to the last number of the previous side and the first number of the next side?

This is too vague. Maybe I need to think about how the numbers are placed on the layer and find their coordinates.

Let me return to the axial coordinate system, with the six directions as follows:

q increases by 1 (direction 0)

r increases by 1 (direction 1)

q decreases by 1 and r increases by 1 (direction 2)

q decreases by 1 (direction 3)

r decreases by 1 (direction 4)

q increases by 1 and r decreases by 1 (direction 5)

Let me try to model the spiral in this coordinate system. Let me try to define the directions in such a way that the spiral goes clockwise, and after each side, turns right (clockwise). 

Let me try to define the sequence of directions for each layer. For example, for each layer k, the six sides are traversed in directions 0, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, or some other sequence. 

Wait, I need a better idea. Maybe I can find the coordinates for the numbers on each side.

Suppose that in layer k, the starting coordinate for the first side is a certain position. For example, in layer 1, the first side starts at (1, 0), as before. If I can determine the starting coordinates for each side, then I can compute the coordinates for 2026 and then find its neighbors.

But how?

Alternatively, note that each side of a layer is in a specific direction. For example, the first side of each layer is in direction 0, then the next side is direction 4, then direction 5, etc. But I need to figure out the correct sequence.

Wait, let me look at how the layers connect. For example, the last number of layer k's sixth side should be adjacent to the first number of layer k+1's first side.

Alternatively, after completing a full layer, the starting point of the next layer is adjacent.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to find a pattern or formula for the neighbors.

Given that 2026 is in layer 26, third side, position 23. Let's assume that on this side, moving in some direction d. Then, its neighbors would be:

- The previous number on the side (2025) and next number on the side (2027).

- A number from the previous layer (inside) at the same relative position.

- A number from the next layer (outside) at the same relative position.

- Two other neighbors from adjacent sides?

Wait, but without knowing the exact direction, it's hard to say. However, in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For a cell not at a corner of the layer, it would have two neighbors along its side, one from the previous side and one from the next side, and two from inside and outside.

But since I don't know the direction, maybe I can calculate the difference between numbers in the spiral.

For example, in a side of layer k, each number is spaced by a certain step. If I can find what that step is, I can calculate the differences.

Wait, in square spirals, moving along a side, each step changes the number by 1, but when you turn, the step changes. However, in a hexagonal spiral, moving along a side, the numbers increase by 1 as you go along, since you're moving along the side.

So, for the third side of layer 26, numbers go from 2004 to 2029, increasing by 1 each step. So, the neighbors along the side are 2025 and 2027.

Now, the other neighbors are from other parts of the spiral.

Now, what about the number from the previous layer? If we are on the third side of layer k=26, the previous layer is k=25. At position 23 on the third side of layer 26, there should be a neighbor from layer 25 in the same direction. Similarly, a neighbor from layer 27 in the same direction.

If I can determine what number that is, I can add it to the sum.

For example, if moving along the third side, each step corresponds to moving in a certain direction. If I can determine what that direction is, then going back one layer in that direction would give a number in layer 25, and going forward one layer would give a number in layer 27.

But how to find the number in layer 25 in that direction?

Alternatively, since the position along the side is 23, maybe the number in the previous layer is at position 23 on the same side in layer 25. But layer 25 has sides of length 25, so if the third side of layer 25 has numbers from [T(24)+1 + 25*(side-1)] to ... 

Let me calculate. 

For layer 25, total numbers up to layer 24 is T(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600 = 1 + 1800 = 1801.

Each side of layer 25 has 25 numbers. So third side starts at T(24) + 1 + 2*25 = 1801 + 1 + 50 = 1852. And ends at 1852 + 24 = 1876. Since our position is 23 on the side, the number would be 1852 + 22 = 1874? Wait, if position 1 is 1852, then position n is 1852 + n -1. So position 23 is 1852 + 22 = 1874.

Therefore, if the number in layer 25 in the same direction is 1874, then that is a neighbor of 2026.

Similarly, for layer 27, the same side would have numbers starting at T(26) + 1 + 2*27 = 2107 + 1 + 54 = 2162, and position 23 would be 2162 + 22 = 2184. So 2184 would be the neighbor in layer 27. 

Then, for the neighbors from the other directions. What about the numbers at the beginning and end of the side? If our number is not at a corner, then it has neighbors from the adjacent sides.

Wait, but how to calculate those?

For example, the number at the start of the third side (position 1) is 2004. Its neighbor would be the end of the second side, which is 2003, and the start of the fourth side, which is 2030. But since our number is in position 23 of 26 (third side), it is not at the corner, so it should have two neighbors from the adjacent sides. But how?

Wait, in a hexagonal grid, each hex has six neighbors. Since we have two neighbors along the side (2025 and 2027), one from the previous layer (1874), one from the next layer (2184), that's four neighbors. We need two more.

These would come from adjacent sides. For example, depending on position on the side, there might be neighbors from the previous side or next side in the same layer.

But since the number is not at the corner of the side, it is adjacent to a number from the previous side and a number from the next side in the same layer?

Wait, no, because it's in the middle of the side. So maybe not. Or maybe it's adjacent to one number from the previous side and one from the next side?

But how to calculate those?

Let me think of the axial coordinates. Assume that moving along the third side of layer 26, in some direction. If I can determine what that direction is, then the previous side's end and next side's start would be adjacent.

Alternatively, since each side is in a particular direction, the number at position m on a side is adjacent to the number at the end of the previous side and the number at the start of the next side, but only if it's at the beginning or end. For numbers in the middle, perhaps they are not adjacent to those.

Alternatively, think of the numbers on the side as forming a straight line. Each number in the line has two neighbors: the previous and next on the line. Then, the other four neighbors are from adjacent parts of the spiral.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. Maybe I need to consider that in addition to the four neighbors already mentioned (previous, next, inward, outward), there are two more neighbors from adjacent directions.

Let me try to calculate the differences. In square spirals, the neighbors of a number can differ by values depending on their position, but here, with hexagonal, perhaps similar.

But I need a different approach. Let me think about the formula for the numbers in the directions.

If I assume that the neighbors of 2026 are:

- 2025 (previous)

- 2027 (next)

- 1874 (inward)

- 2184 (outward)

Plus two more. Let's think about the numbers at the corners of the layer.

The third side of layer 26 starts at 2004 and ends at 2029. The end of the third side (2029) is the corner, which would be adjacent to the start of the fourth side (2030). Similarly, the start of the third side (2004) is adjacent to the end of the second side (2003).

But our number 2026 is somewhere in the middle of the third side. Is it adjacent to any numbers from other sides of the same layer?

Possibly. For example, in the middle of the side, it could be adjacent to numbers from the previous side and next side, but not sure how to calculate.

Wait, here's an idea. In a hexagonal grid, moving along a straight side, each step you take is in a certain direction. The neighbors from the other sides can be determined by moving in the directions perpendicular to your side.

But without coordinates, it's hard. But maybe the difference between numbers in those directions can be calculated.

Alternatively, think of the numbers at the beginning and end of the side. For example, the number at the start of the third side (2004) is adjacent to the number at the end of the second side (2003). The difference between 2004 and 2003 is +1. Similarly, the number at the end of the third side (2029) is adjacent to the number at the start of the fourth side (2030), difference is +1. For numbers in the middle of the side, their neighbors from the adjacent sides may have different differences.

But how much? Let's think about the layer structure.

Each layer is a ring around the previous one. If you are on a side of a layer, moving along it, then at each step, you are moving in a certain direction. The numbers adjacent from other directions would depend on which side you are on.

For example, if you are on the third side, the numbers from the second side and the fourth side may be adjacent at certain positions.

But since our number is 2026, which is the 23rd on the third side of layer 26, which has length 26. The difference from the end of the side is 26 - 23 = 3. So it's 3 steps before the end.

At this point, perhaps the number is adjacent to a number from the fourth side, which is 3 steps from the start. Similarly, it might be adjacent to a number from the second side, which is 23 steps from the end?

But how to calculate the numbers?

Let me try. The start of the fourth side is 2030. The number 3 steps from the start of the fourth side is 2030 + 2 = 2032? Wait, if position 1 is 2030, position 2 is 2031, position 3 is 2032. So if 2026 is 3 steps before the end of the third side, it might be adjacent to the 3rd number on the fourth side, which is 2032. Similarly, it might be adjacent to the number which is 23 steps back from the end of the second side.

The second side ends at 2003. The number 23 steps back from the end is 2003 - 23 + 1 = 1981. Wait, how?

Let me clarify. The second side has numbers from 1978 to 2003, which is 26 numbers. The end is at position 26: 2003. The number 23 steps before the end is position 26 - 23 = 3. So the third number on the second side, which is 1978 + 2 = 1980. Wait, position 1: 1978, position 2: 1979, position 3: 1980. Therefore, the number 1980 is 23 steps before the end of the second side.

So if 2026 is adjacent to 1980 and 2032, then those would be the remaining two neighbors.

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 would be:

- 2025 (previous)

- 2027 (next)

- 1874 (in layer 25)

- 2184 (in layer 27)

- 1980 (in layer 26, second side)

- 2032 (in layer 26, fourth side)

Let me verify this logic.

In a hexagonal grid, each hex has neighbors in six directions. If we are on the middle of a side, then the two neighbors from the adjacent sides would be from the previous and next sides in the layer, at a certain offset. 

For example, if you move along a side, each hex is adjacent to one hex from the previous side and one from the next side, at the same relative position. The relative position is determined by how far along the side you are.

Since our number is the 23rd on the third side, then it would be adjacent to the 23rd number on the second side (but wait, the second side has already passed)? Or maybe it's adjacent to the 23rd number from the end of the previous side?

Earlier I considered that if it is 3 steps away from the end of the third side, it might be 3 steps from the start of the fourth side, giving the fourth number on the fourth side. Similarly, it might be 23 steps from the start of the third side, giving 23 steps from the end of the second side, hence the third number on the second side.

If this is correct, then those numbers would be neighbors.

Let me check with the example. Take the number 3 in the given spiral example. It is in layer 1, second side, position 1 on that side. Following the same logic, it would be adjacent to the number from the first side (position 1: number 2), and the number from the third side (position 1: number 4). Also, inward neighbor would be 1, and outward neighbor would be...? But layer 1 is the first layer, so no outward neighbor. Let's see. According to the example, the neighbors of 3 are 2, 4, 1, and maybe others. It does have those neighbors. Additionally, in the example, number 3 is adjacent to number 10. How?

Wait, in the example:

... 14  4  3  10 ...

So number 3 is adjacent to 4, 1, 2, and 10. So there are two more neighbors. According to my previous logic, it would only account for 2, 4, 1, but missing 10. So perhaps my logic is incomplete.

This suggests that there are other neighbors from the next side, which might be the start of the next layer? Or within the same layer.

For number 3 on the second side of layer 1, it might be adjacent to the start of the third side (number 4) and the end of the first side (number 2), and also adjacent to a number outside, but since it's on layer 1, there's layer 2 starting at 8. How is number 3 adjacent to 10?

Looking at the example, number 3 is in the upper middle, and number 10 is to its right. In the hexagonal grid, this might be a neighbor from the next layer. However, if layer 2 starts at 8, how is it connected to 3? It might be that number 3 is adjacent to number 10, which is on the first side of layer 2. 

But according to my previous calculation, the first number of layer 2's first side is 8. If number 3 is adjacent to it, then there should be a neighbor from the next layer. But according to my formula for outward neighbor, it would be 3 + something. However, if for layer 1, the outward neighbor would be in layer 2, same relative position. For number 3, which is on second side, first position, the relative position would translate to first position on the second side of layer 2? Not sure.

This suggests that my earlier assumption about the outward neighbor being in the same relative position might not be correct.

Given this confusion, I need to verify if my previous assumption for the neighbors 1980 and 2032 is correct.

Let me assume that in addition to the four neighbors (2025, 2027, 1874, 2184), there are two more neighbors which are 1980 and 2032. Then, the sum would be 2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2184 + 1980 + 2032.

Let me compute that sum.

First, compute 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = 4058

1980 + 2032 = 4012

Total sum: 4052 + 4058 = 8110; 8110 + 4012 = 12122.

But I need to check if this is the correct answer. However, without knowing if the assumption about 1980 and 2032 is correct, it's risky. Let me try to verify with the example.

Take number 3 in the example. If we apply the same logic, it is in layer 1, third side? Or second side? Earlier, layer 1 third side starts at number 4. Number 3 is on the second side of layer 1, position 1. Let's see:

For number 3, position is layer k=1, side m=2, position p=1.

Then inward neighbor would be number from layer k-1=0 (which is 1).

Outward neighbor would be layer k+1=2, same side and position: starting number of layer 2, side m=2, position p=1. Layer 2's second side starts at T(1) + 1 + 1*26? Wait no, for layer k=2, starting number is T(1) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8. Each side has k=2 numbers, so first side: 8-9, second side: 10-11, third side: 12-13, etc. So position p=1 on second side is 10.

Therefore outward neighbor would be 10. Which matches the example: number 3 is adjacent to 10. So in this case, the formula holds: outward neighbor is the same side and position on the next layer. Similarly, inward neighbor is the same side and position on previous layer (if exists). For number 3, inward neighbor would be layer k-1=0, but since k=1, there is no inward neighbor except the center.

So this seems to hold. So for number 3, neighbors are 2 (previous), 4 (next), 1 (inward), 10 (outward), and what about the other two? According to the earlier idea, there should be two more from previous and next sides. 

Using the same logic: since p=1 on side m=2, it is p=1 steps from the start of the side, which is 1 step, so 1 step from the previous side (side m=1) and 1 step from the next side (side m=3). 

Layer 1, side m=1 ends at number 2. 1 step from end is number 2 itself. Layer 1, side m=3 starts at 4. 1 step from start is 4. So neighbors would be 2 and 4, which we already accounted for. Wait, but we already included next and previous on the side. So perhaps in this case, there are no additional neighbors
