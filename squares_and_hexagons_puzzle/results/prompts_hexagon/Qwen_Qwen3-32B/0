Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid. Let me start by understanding how the spiral is structured. The problem shows a small part of the spiral with numbers like 14, 4, 3, 10... and so on. From the given example, it seems like numbers spiral outward from the center, which is occupied by 1. Each layer or ring around the center probably adds more numbers. In a hexagonal grid, each ring k (starting from 0 at the center) contains 6*k numbers. Hmm, so the first ring (k=1) has 6 numbers, the second ring (k=2) has 12 numbers, and so on. That makes sense because each ring adds a layer around the previous hexagon.

First, I need to determine on which ring the number 2026 is located. To do this, I can calculate the maximum number in each ring. The center is 1. The first ring (k=1) ends with 1 + 6*1 = 7? Wait, but if the first ring has 6 numbers, starting from 2 to 7? Wait, but looking at the example given, numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... So yes, 1 is the center, and numbers 2 through 7 are in the first ring. Then the next ring would have numbers from 8 to 8 + 6*2 = 20. Wait, 6*2 is 12 numbers, so starting at 8 and ending at 8 + 12 - 1 = 19. Then third ring would start at 20 and end at 20 + 18 - 1 = 37. Wait, let me think again. For each ring k (starting at k=0), the starting number is 1 + 6*(k(k-1)/2) ??? Maybe there's a formula here.

Alternatively, think about the total numbers up to ring n-1 is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 6*(n-1)*n/2. Simplifying that, it's 1 + 3n(n-1). So the starting number of ring n is previous maximum number + 1 = [1 + 3(n-1)(n-2)] + 1? Wait, maybe let me think again. Total numbers in all rings up to and including ring k is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) ??? Wait, no, if the rings are k=0 (center), k=1 (first ring), etc. Wait, maybe my earlier thought was correct.

Wait, if each ring has 6*k numbers where k is the ring number starting at 1. Then the total numbers up to ring m is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + m) = 1 + 6*(m(m+1)/2) = 1 + 3m(m+1). Wait, but when m=0, total numbers is 1 (the center). For m=1, total numbers is 1 + 3*1*2=7, which matches with numbers 1 to 7. Then for m=2, total numbers is 1 + 3*2*3=19. Which is starting at 8 and adding 12 numbers (6*2) to get to 19. Then ring m=3 is 1 + 3*3*4= 37. So starting at 20 and adding 18 numbers to reach 37. So yeah, that formula seems correct.

Therefore, given a number N, we can find which ring it is in by finding m such that 1 + 3(m-1)m < N ≤ 1 + 3m(m+1). Wait, let me clarify. Since total numbers up to ring m is 1 + 3m(m+1). But the rings are indexed starting from m=0? Wait no, if m=0 is the center only (total numbers 1). m=1 is total numbers 1 + 3*1*(1+1)? Wait that would be 1 + 3*1*2 = 7. Which is correct. So for each m ≥ 0, the total numbers up to and including ring m is 1 + 3m(m+1). Therefore, to find the ring for a given number N, solve for m in 1 + 3m(m+1) ≥ N. Then subtract 1 until the previous total is less than N.

Alternatively, solve for m in 3m(m+1) +1 ≥ N. Let me try solving for m such that 3m² + 3m +1 ≥ N. Let me rearrange.

Let me consider N=2026. So 3m² + 3m +1 ≥ 2026. Let me solve 3m² +3m +1 -2026 ≥0 => 3m² +3m -2025 ≥0. Let me solve 3m² +3m -2025 = 0. Using quadratic formula: m = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 4*3*2025)]/(2*3). Let me compute sqrt(9 + 24300) = sqrt(24309). Let me see, 155² is 24025, 156²=24336. So sqrt(24309) is between 155 and 156. Let me calculate 155.5² = (155 + 0.5)^2 = 155² + 2*155*0.5 + 0.25 = 24025 + 155 + 0.25 = 24180.25. Still less than 24309. 155.5^2 = 24180.25. 156^2=24336. So difference between 24309 and 24180.25 is approx 128.75. Then 24309 - 24180.25 = 128.75. So each increment of 1 in m adds about 2*155.5 +1 per linear term? Wait maybe I should just approximate m ≈ sqrt( (2025)/3 ). Since 3m² ~ 2025 => m² ~ 675 => m ~ sqrt(675) ≈ 25.98. So m≈26.

Testing m=25: total numbers up to m=25 is 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950= 1951.

For m=26: total numbers is 1 + 3*26*27= 1 + 3*702= 1 + 2106=2107. So 2107. Since 2026 is between 1951 and 2107, that means N=2026 is in ring m=26. Wait, but m here is the index such that total numbers up to m is 1 + 3m(m+1). Therefore, ring m=26 is the ring where numbers range from previous total +1=1952 to 2107. So 2026 is in ring 26. Let me note that.

Now, within ring m=26, how far along the ring is 2026? The starting number of the ring m=26 is 1952. The position within the ring is 2026 - 1951= 2026 - 1951=75. Wait, because up to ring m=25 is 1951 numbers. Therefore, the numbers in ring m=26 are from 1952 to 2107. The position of N=2026 is 2026 - 1951=75th number in the ring. Since each ring has 6*m numbers, m=26, 6*26=156 numbers in the ring. Therefore, 75 is less than 156, so that's okay.

Now, to find the neighbors of N=2026, we need to find where 2026 is located on the ring. But how exactly is the spiral structured? In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has six sides, and numbers progress along each side. The challenge is to figure out the coordinates or the position of the number 2026 on the ring, then determine its six neighbors.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical way to determine what numbers are adjacent to a given number on the spiral without having to map coordinates. But first, maybe it's helpful to understand how numbers progress in the spiral.

In the example given, the numbers spiral outward. Let me try to sketch another example.

Looking at the given example:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Wait, arranging it as a hexagonal grid is a bit challenging. Let me try to visualize the layers.

Center is 1. The first ring (ring 1) has six numbers: moving clockwise from 2 to 7. Let me try to imagine how they are placed.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has six "sides". Each side has m numbers, where m is the ring number. For example, ring 1 (m=1) has 6 numbers, each side has 1 number. Ring 2 (m=2) has 12 numbers, each side has 2 numbers. So for ring m, each side has m numbers.

Therefore, for ring m=26, each side has 26 numbers. The total numbers in the ring 26 is 6*26=156, which matches.

So the 75th number in the ring can be located on a particular side.

Since each side has 26 numbers, then the position along the ring can be determined by dividing 75 by 26. Let me compute how many sides we have passed before reaching the position.

Since each side is 26 numbers, 75 divided by 26 is 2 with a remainder of 75 - 2*26 = 75 - 52 = 23. So the position is on the 3rd side (since first side is 0-25, second is 26-51, third is 52-77). Position is 23 along the third side. Wait, position is 75-52=23? Wait, starting from 0, the first side (side 0) is positions 1 to 26? Or is it 0-based? Let me clarify.

Let me think about the ring m. The ring starts at a certain point, let's say after the center. For example, ring 1 (m=1) starts at number 2. If I imagine going clockwise around the hexagon, each side has m numbers. For m=1, each side has 1 number. So starting from the east direction (assuming directions), going northeast, northwest, etc.

But perhaps the exact direction isn't as important as figuring out the position on the ring. Since the 75th number is on the third side of the ring, and is 23 steps along that side. Wait, but perhaps we need to determine the coordinates relative to the ring?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each ring as being defined by directions. For example, each ring can be thought of as moving in six directions. In hexagonal grids, moves can be thought of in axial coordinates or cube coordinates, but maybe that complicates things.

Alternatively, think of each ring having six corners. Each corner is the end of a side. For example, for ring m, each side has m numbers, and the corners are the numbers at the end of each side. The numbers at the corners have coordinates that can be computed based on ring number.

For example, the first corner of the ring m is the starting number plus m numbers. Wait, not sure. Maybe think of each side as starting at a corner. Let me think of the ring starting at the "east" direction. Then moving along the first side (east to northeast), placing m numbers. Then turning 60 degrees (northeast to northwest), placing m numbers, etc.

But for our purposes, perhaps we can find the nearest "corner" numbers for the number 2026.

Alternatively, for each ring, the numbers at the corners are the starting number of the ring plus k*m, where k is 0,1,...,6. Wait, let me think. For example, ring m starts at S. Then each side has m numbers. Therefore, the first corner is S + m, then next corner is S + 2m, then S + 3m, ..., up to S +6m. But since total numbers in the ring is 6m, then S +6m is the end of the ring. However, the starting number of the ring is S = previous_total + 1. For our case, ring m=26 starts at S=1952. Therefore, the numbers at corners are 1952 + 26*k, where k=1...6. Let's compute that:

First corner: 1952 + 26 = 1978

Second corner: 1978 +26= 2004

Third corner: 2004 +26=2030

Fourth corner: 2030 +26=2056

Fifth corner: 2056 +26=2082

Sixth corner: 2082 +26=2108. Wait, but 2108 is beyond the end of the ring, which was 2107. So actually, the sixth corner would be 2107. Maybe there's an off-by-one error here.

Wait, the starting number is S=1952. The first side goes from S=1952 to S+25 (since it's 26 numbers). Then the first corner is S+26=1952+26=1978. Then the second side goes from 1978 to 1978+25, ending at 1978+25=2003, then the second corner is 2003 +1=2004? Wait, maybe the corner is the first number of the next side.

Alternatively, maybe if each side has m numbers, then the corners are between the sides. For example, between side 1 and side 2 is a corner. Therefore, the numbers at the corners are the last number of each side, which is S + m -1, then S + 2m -1, etc. Let me think:

Starting number S=1952. First side has numbers from S to S + m -1 = 1952 to 1952 +25=1977. Then the first corner is 1977. Then second side starts at 1978 and goes to 1978 +25=2003, second corner is 2003. Third side: 2004 to 2004+25=2029, third corner is 2029. Fourth side: 2030 to 2030+25=2055, fourth corner 2055. Fifth: 2056 to 2081, fifth corner 2081. Sixth side: 2082 to 2107, sixth corner 2107. Then total numbers: 2107 - 1952 +1= 156, which is correct.

Therefore, the corners of ring m=26 are at numbers: 1977, 2003, 2029, 2055, 2081, 2107.

Given that our number is 2026, which is in ring m=26. Let's see where it falls between the corners.

Looking at the corners:

First corner:1977

Second corner:2003

Third corner:2029

Fourth corner:2055

So 2026 is between 2003 (second corner) and 2029 (third corner). Therefore, it's on the third side of the ring. Wait, the sides are:

First side: 1952-1977

Second side:1978-2003

Third side:2004-2029

Fourth side:2030-2055

So 2026 is on the third side of the ring. Let me check:

2004 to 2029 is third side. So 2026 is 2026 - 2004 +1 = 23rd number on this side? Wait, starting from 2004 as the first number on the side. 2026 - 2004 = 22, so it's the 23rd number on the third side (since 0-based index would be 22). The side has 26 numbers? Wait, third side goes from 2004 to 2029, which is 26 numbers: 2029 - 2004 +1=26.

Yes, so if the third side starts at 2004 and ends at 2029 (the third corner), then the number 2026 is 2026 - 2004 = 22 steps from the start of the side (if we consider 0th step as 2004, then 22nd step is 2004 +22=2026). Therefore, since each side is of length m=26, then the position along the side is 22 steps from the beginning of the side. Now, depending on the direction of the side, we can determine the neighbors.

In a hexagonal spiral, when moving along a side, the numbers increase in one direction. The neighbors depend on the direction. But perhaps there's a systematic way to calculate neighbors.

But perhaps it's easier to model the numbers in axial coordinates, or some coordinate system for the hex grid. However, since I'm not familiar with axial coordinates, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think about how the neighbors of a number on a hexagonal spiral relate to other numbers. Each number has six neighbors. In the spiral, each time you move outward, the numbers increase or decrease depending on the direction.

Alternatively, since I know that 2026 is on the third side of the ring m=26, and is 22 steps from the beginning of the side. Let me think of the position on the grid. For a hexagonal grid, each ring has coordinates that can be described in terms of directions. However, without coordinates, maybe think of the neighbors as:

For a number located on side k of the ring, its neighbors would be:

- The previous and next numbers along the same side (two neighbors)

- Numbers from adjacent sides of the same ring

- Numbers from the inner ring

- Numbers from the outer ring?

Wait, perhaps not sure. But given that the number is on a ring, its neighbors could be:

- Two along the same side: left and right

- One at the corner, but wait maybe not.

Wait maybe for a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors. So for our number 2026 on the third side of the ring, the six neighbors would be:

1. The number before it on the same side

2. The number after it on the same side

3. The number on the previous side in the same ring

4. The number on the next side in the same ring

5. The number from the inner ring towards the center

6. The number from the outer ring outward.

But need to figure out which numbers these are.

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the neighbors. Let me try to think.

First, the neighbors along the same side: straightforward. The number before is 2026 -1 = 2025, and the number after is 2026 +1=2027. Except if it's at the end of the side. But 2026 is on the third side, which ends at 2029, so 2026 is not at the end. Therefore, those two neighbors are 2025 and 2027.

Then there are four more neighbors. How to find them?

Let me think of the structure of the ring. For a number on the third side of ring m, the two adjacent sides are side 2 and side 4. Each of these sides ends at the corners. But how do they relate to the current number?

Alternatively, let's think of each side as having a direction. Depending on the side, the "across" neighbors (not on the same side) would be located on adjacent sides. Perhaps the numbers that are in the middle of the adjacent sides. Alternatively, numbers that are offset by certain positions.

Alternatively, use a coordinate system. Let me recall that in a hexagonal grid, you can use axial coordinates (q, r), with s = -q - r. Each step in a direction changes one of the coordinates. But perhaps to model our spiral.

Alternatively, think about the numbers on the corners. For ring m, the corners are numbers where the sides end. For example, our ring m=26 has corners at 1977, 2003, 2029, etc. Each corner is connected to the center via a straight line. The numbers at the corners can be thought of as being at the "ends" of each radius.

Given that, if our number is between corners, perhaps we can find its position relative to the inner and outer rings.

For example, if I can find the "base" number of the side, then move inward or outward.

But maybe another way. Let's think about the fact that each side of the ring is adjacent to two sides of the inner ring. Therefore, for a number on side k of ring m, there are two neighbors from the inner ring (m-1), and other neighbors from adjacent sides of ring m, and one neighbor from the outer ring (m+1) if it exists.

Wait, but since we are on ring m=26, the outer ring is m=27, but our number is 2026 which is less than the maximum of the ring m=26 (which is 2107), so neighbors from outer ring would be numbers in ring m=27.

But maybe not. Let me think. Each position on the ring has neighbors both inside and outside. So for example, if you're on the middle of a side, there's one neighbor going inward toward the center, and another going outward from the center. However, since our number is on ring m=26, the inward neighbor is on ring m=25, and the outward neighbor is on ring m=27. The rest of the neighbors are on the same ring.

But how to calculate those numbers?

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the difference between numbers on adjacent rings. For example, the numbers on ring m are larger than those on ring m-1. The difference between a number and its inward neighbor can depend on the position.

But perhaps there's a way to calculate this. Let me consider the general case.

For any number N on ring m, which is on side k of the ring. Let me denote that ring m has 6m numbers. Each side has m numbers. The corners are as we calculated before.

For numbers not on the corner, moving inward from N would lead to a number on ring m-1. Similarly, moving outward leads to ring m+1.

But how to compute their values?

Alternatively, think of the numbers on the ring as being aligned with certain axes. For example, each corner of the ring is aligned with a direction from the center. For example, the first corner (say, east direction) is at distance m from the center. The numbers on that side are moving from east to northeast direction.

If we can find the relationship between numbers in a direction and numbers in adjacent rings, we can find the neighbors.

Alternatively, consider that for a given ring m, the numbers on each side can be represented in terms of a starting corner minus or plus something.

Alternatively, let's take an example. Let me take a smaller number where I can visualize and check.

Take for example, number 2 in ring m=1. It is on the first side. Its neighbors would be 1 (inward), 3 (next on the side), 8 (outward?), and numbers from adjacent sides? Wait, need to know the actual spiral.

Looking at the example given:

The center is 1.

First ring (m=1) numbers: 2 through 7.

Second ring (m=2) numbers: 8 through 19.

Looking at the layout:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So 2 is adjacent to 1 (center), 3 (right), and 9 (down-right). Also, it's adjacent to 4 (up-right?), and 15? Not sure from the diagram, but since it's a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors.

Looking at the given numbers:

Number 2 is adjacent to 1, 3, 9, 4, 15, and 5? Wait, maybe not. It might depend on the exact layout. This is confusing without a clear coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of visualizing, use the mathematical structure.

In any case, maybe for a number on ring m, located on side k, position p along the side (from 0 to m-1), its neighbors can be calculated as follows:

1. The neighbor along the side: previous and next numbers.

2. The neighbor on the same ring, from the previous side: ?

3. The neighbor on the same ring, from the next side: ?

4. The inward neighbor on ring m-1.

5. The outward neighbor on ring m+1.

But need to figure out the exact numbers.

Alternatively, think of the numbers as coordinates in a hexagonal grid. For example, in axial coordinates, each ring can be associated with certain values.

But maybe let's use the formula for numbers on the rings.

First, for the inward neighbor: if our number is N on ring m, then the inward neighbor would depend on its position. For numbers on a side between two corners, the inward neighbor can be calculated by subtracting something.

Alternatively, think of the numbers at the corners. For ring m, the numbers at the corners are the last number of each side. For example, the first corner is S + m -1, as we had before. For ring m, the numbers at the corners can be considered as having a coordinate in a certain direction.

For example, each corner corresponds to a direction, say direction 0 to 5. The number at corner j on ring m can be calculated as follows. The starting number of the ring is S=1 + 3m(m-1). Wait no, earlier we had that total number up to ring m is 1 + 3m(m+1). Wait, earlier calculation:

For ring number m (starting from 0), total numbers up to ring m is 1 + 3m(m+1). But when we were calculating for N=2026, we considered m=26 and found S=1952 as the starting number of that ring. Alternatively, perhaps for ring level K (the layer), which is m=K, the starting number is S= 1 + 3K(K-1) + 1? Wait, earlier, the total up to ring m-1 is 1 + 3(m-1)m. Then the starting number of ring m is that value +1, which is 1 + 3(m-1)m +1= 2 + 3m(m-1). But earlier for m=1, starting number was 2, and 3*1*0 +1 +1? Wait no. Wait total numbers up to ring m-1 is 1 + 3*(m-1)*m. So starting number of ring m is previous_total +1 = 1 + 3*(m-1)*m + 1 = 2 + 3m(m-1). Wait for m=1, that would be 2 + 3*1*0= 2, which is correct. For m=2, 2 + 3*2*1= 8, which is also correct (numbers from 8 to 19). So yes, S(m) = 2 + 3m(m - 1). Alternatively, S(m) = 1 + 3m(m - 1) +1 = same thing. So in general, S(m) = 2 + 3m(m - 1).

But how does that help? For inward neighbor.

Alternatively, consider that each corner number on ring m is at position C_j(m) = S(m) + j*m where j=0,...,5. Except adjusted for the end. Wait earlier for m=26, the first corner was 1977 which is S(m) + (m - something). Wait earlier we calculated S=1952 for m=26. First corner was 1977= S + 25=1952+25=1977. Because the first side has m=26 numbers starting from S=1952. The first corner is the end of the first side, at position S +25=1952+25=1977. Then the next side starts at S +26=1952+26=1978. Similarly, the end of side j is S + j*m -1. Wait, for side 0, end at S + 0*m + (m -1) = S + m -1. For side 1, end at S + m + m -1 = S + 2m -1, etc. So corner numbers are C_j = S + j*m, where j ranges from 0 to 5, and then C_6 = S + 6m which is the end of the ring. But since the ring has 6m numbers, C_6 = S + 6m = S(m) +6m. Which for m=26, S=1952, 1952 + 6*26=1952 + 156= 2108, which is beyond the end of the ring (which is 2107). Hence, probably the corners are C_j = S + j*m -1. Wait earlier corners were:

For m=26, first corner is 1977 = S +25=1952 +25=1977, which is S + (m -1). Then C_0 = S +m -1, C_1 = S + 2m -1, ..., up to C_5 = S +6m -1. Which for m=26, C_5=1952 +6*26 -1=1952 +155= 2107, which is correct. Therefore, corners are C_j = S + (j +1)*m -1 for j from 0 to 5. Wait:

For first corner (j=0): C_0 = S + (0 +1)*m -1 = S + m -1

C_j = S + (j +1)*m -1. Then for j from 0 to 5, gives 6 corners.

Therefore, for any number N on ring m, we can determine which side it's on by finding j such that C_{j-1} +1 ≤ N ≤ C_j, where C_{-1} is defined as S -1, but probably j=0 to 5.

Given that, for our N=2026 in ring m=26 (S=1952), the corners are C_j = 1952 + (j+1)*26 -1 = 1952 +26j +26 -1 = 1952 +26j +25 = 1977 +26j. Wait:

Wait, for C_0 = 1952 + (0 +1)*26 -1 = 1952 +25=1977, yes.

C_1=1952 +2*26 -1=1952 +51=2003

C_2=1952 +3*26 -1=1952 +77=2029

C_3=1952 +4*26 -1=1952 +103=2055

C_4=1952 +5*26 -1=1952 +129=2081

C_5=1952 +6*26 -1=1952 +155=2107

So N=2026 is between C_1=2003 and C_2=2029. Therefore, it's on the second side (j=1)? Wait, j from 0 to 5. So between C_{j-1} and C_j. Wait if C_1 is 2003 and C_2 is 2029, then between them is side j=2? Wait j=0 is between C_{-1} and C_0. Probably need to adjust the indexing. Let me think. Each side is between C_{j-1}+1 and C_j. Therefore, the first side (side 0) is from S to C_0 = 1977. Second side (side1) from C_0 +1 = 1978 to C_1=2003. Third side (side2) from C_1 +1=2004 to C_2=2029. Hence our N=2026 is on side2 (third side). Therefore, side index is 2 (starting from 0). Therefore, to find neighbors, it's on side j=2, position p = N - C_{j-1} -1 = ?

Wait C_{j-1} is C_1=2003 for j=2. Therefore N - C_{j-1} -1 = 2026 -2003 -1= 22. So p=22, meaning it's 22 steps into side j=2.

But each side has m=26 numbers, so p ranges from 0 to m-1=25.

Therefore, with p=22 on side j=2.

Now, how to find the neighbors. Let's try to find formulas for neighbors based on side and position.

First, neighbors along the side: previous and next are straightforward.

Previous: N -1 = 2025

Next: N +1 = 2027

Now, the other four neighbors. These would be:

- The number that is adjacent from the side before (side1) at the same position from the corner.

- The number that is adjacent from the side after (side3) at the same position from the corner.

- The number inward (towards center).

- The number outward (away from center).

Wait, maybe not exactly the same position, but some offset.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the following. For a number on side j at position p, there are neighbors on the same ring, which are:

- The number on side j-1, which is at position p from the corner.

- The number on side j+1, which is at position p from the corner.

Wait not sure. Alternatively, if you imagine the hexagonal ring, each side is adjacent to two other sides. When moving along a side, at each position, there's a diagonal neighbor from the previous side and another from the next side.

Alternatively, think of a hexagonal ring as having numbers arranged such that each number on a side has a neighbor from the previous side and the next side, which is offset by certain amount.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the number with its neighbors based on its side and position.

Let me consider that for a number on side j at position p (where 0 ≤ p < m), then the neighbors on the same ring would be:

- On side j-1: the number which is p steps before the corner from side j-1 to side j.

Wait, when you are on side j, the corner between side j-1 and side j is C_{j-1} = S + j*m -1. Wait earlier we had C_j = S + (j+1)*m -1. Therefore, the corner between side j-1 and side j is C_{j-1}.

If we are on side j at position p, then the number p steps counterclockwise from the corner C_{j-1} would be on side j. To find the neighbor on side j-1, it would be p steps clockwise from the corner? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe when moving from side j-1 to side j, the starting number of side j is C_{j-1} + 1. For example, side j starts at C_{j-1} + 1. Therefore, if I'm on side j at position p, then the number on side j-1 adjacent to it would be C_{j-1} - p? Wait let's test with an example.

Take side j=2 (third side) on ring m=26. Starting at C_1 +1 = 2004. Suppose p=0: the first number on side j=2 is 2004. Its neighbor on side j-1 (side1) would be... Looking at the layout, if it's the first number on side j=2, then it's adjacent to the end of side j-1. The end of side j-1 is C_{j-1}=2003. So neighbor would be 2003. But according to formula C_{j-1} -p: C_{j-1}=2003, p=0, then 2003 -0=2003. Correct. Similarly, if p=1, the neighbor on side j-1 would be 2003 -1=2002. But the number on side j=2 at p=1 is 2005. So its neighbor on side j-1 is 2002? Is 2002 adjacent to 2005?

Not sure without seeing the grid. But maybe this is the correct relation.

Alternatively, think of the number on side j at position p as being adjacent to the number on side j-1 at position m - 1 - p. Wait not sure.

Alternatively, consider that moving around the ring, each number on side j is adjacent to the number on side j-1 at the same offset from the corner. Wait for example, at the beginning of side j, p=0, the neighbor on side j-1 is at the end of side j-1, which is p=m-1. Wait confusing.

Alternatively, consider the corner C_{j-1} which connects side j-1 and side j. The numbers on side j-1 go up to C_{j-1}. The numbers on side j start at C_{j-1}+1. Therefore, the number at position p on side j is C_{j-1} +1 + p. Therefore, to find a neighbor on side j-1 adjacent to this number, it would be C_{j-1} - p? For example, at p=0, C_{j-1} +1 +0 = C_{j-1} +1 is the start of side j, and its adjacent neighbor on side j-1 is C_{j-1} (end of side j-1). Which is C_{j-1} -p where p=0: C_{j-1} -0 = C_{j-1} which is correct. At p=1, neighbor would be C_{j-1} -1. So yes, the neighbor on side j-1 is C_{j-1} - p.

Similarly, the neighbor on side j+1 would be C_j + 1 + p? Wait, no. Let me think. For the neighbor on side j+1: when you are on side j at position p, there's a diagonal neighbor on side j+1. How to compute that?

The side j+1 starts at C_j + 1. The number p steps from the start of side j+1 would be C_j +1 + p. But the diagonal neighbor would be... Hmm. Alternatively, if moving from side j towards the next side, the neighbor would be on side j+1 at position p?

But if you are at position p on side j, then the number on side j+1 that is adjacent would be... Let's think of the end of side j is at C_j. Then when moving to side j+1, the first number is C_j +1. The number at the start of side j+1 is adjacent to the end of side j. Therefore, if you are somewhere on side j, there might be an adjacent number on side j+1. For example, the number N on side j at position p is adjacent to N1 on side j+1. To find N1, perhaps it's C_j +1 + (m - p -1). Wait not sure.

Alternatively, think of the following: for the number on side j at position p, there are two neighbors on adjacent sides. One on side j-1 and one on side j+1. These neighbors can be calculated based on the corners.

The number on side j-1 that is adjacent to our number would be C_{j-1} - p.

Similarly, the number on side j+1 that is adjacent would be C_{j} + (m - p -1). Let me test with an example.

Take side j=2 on ring m=26. C_{j-1}=C_1=2003, C_j=C_2=2029. For our number N=2026 at p=22 on side j=2.

The neighbor on side j-1=1 would be C_{j-1} -p = 2003 -22=1981. Is 1981 adjacent to 2026? Let's see. How far apart are they? 2026 - 1981 = 45. Given that the entire ring has numbers increasing by 1 as we go around, but positions are on different sides. It might depend on the grid geometry, but maybe this is a valid formula.

Similarly, the neighbor on side j+1=3 would be C_j + (m - p -1)= 2029 + (26 -22 -1)=2029 +3=2032. Therefore, neighbor is 2032. Then 2032 -2026=6. Hmmm. If those numbers are neighbors, their difference might be related to the geometry.

Alternatively, maybe this is correct. Let me try with p=0 on side j=2:

Neighbor on side j-1=1 would be C_{j-1} - p =2003 -0=2003, which is the end of side1, which is adjacent to start of side2 (2004). So yes, 2003 is adjacent to 2004. But 2004 is at p=0 on side2. So yes, the formula gives the correct neighbor.

For p=0 on side j=2, neighbor on side j+1=3 would be C_j + (26 -0 -1)=2029 +25=2054. Which would be the penultimate number on side3 (since side3 ends at 2055). That makes sense, as the start of side3, 2030, is adjacent to 2029 (end of side2). So 2029 is adjacent to 2030. Similarly, the first number on side3, 2030, is adjacent to p=25 on side2? Wait according to the formula, for p=0 on side3, neighbor on side2 would be C_{2} - p?

Wait no, if we were on side j=3 at p=0, then neighbor on side j-1=2 would be C_{j-1} - p = C_2 -0=2029 -0=2029. Which is end of side2. Yes, correct. So in reverse, for p=0 on side j=2, the neighbor on side3 is C_j + (m - p -1)=2029 + (26 -0 -1)=2029 +25=2054. Is 2029 adjacent to 2054? Probably not directly because they are on adjacent sides but offset. However, 2029 (end of side2) is adjacent to 2030 (start of side3). Then 2030 is adjacent to 2031, and so on. So 2054 is 24 steps from 2030 on side3, which would be 2030 +24=2054. So it's mid-side. How is that adjacent to p=0 on side2? Maybe the neighborship is not direct? Maybe my formulas are wrong.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For a cell on the middle of a side, two of its neighbors are along the side, one is inward, one is outward, and two are on adjacent sides. However, depending on the position, the neighbors on the adjacent sides might not be at the same position.

Maybe there's a better way. Let's think about directions.

In a hexagonal grid, there are six directions from any cell. When moving along a hexagonal spiral, each ring can be thought of as having numbers arranged in such a way that each side of the ring corresponds to a particular direction.

Alternatively, think of the side numbers as moving in a straight line from one corner to another. The key insight is that for any number on the ring, the inward neighbor is located in the direction towards the center. Similarly, outward neighbor is away from center.

To compute inward neighbor, perhaps we can think of the number as being part of a "arm" of the hexagon, and going inward would be subtracting a certain value.

Alternatively, consider that for any number on a side of ring m, the inward neighbor is located on ring m-1, at a position that is offset by p steps from the inner corner.

Let me take an example. For ring m=2, side j=0 (first side). The inward neighbor of the first number on side j=0 (which is 8) would be something. But maybe not sure.

Alternatively, recall that for any number N on ring m, the inward neighbor can be calculated by N - 6*(m -1). Wait, testing with number 8 on ring m=2: 8 - 6*(2 -1)=8 -6=2, which is not adjacent. Hmm no. Maybe another formula.

Alternatively, the difference between numbers on the same axial line. For example, numbers along a radius from the center. Let's think about the corners, which lie on the radius. For example, the corner at C_j(m) for ring m is directly outward from the corner C_j(m-1) on ring m-1.

For example, take corner C_0(1)= S(1) + (0 +1)*1 -1= S(1) +0= S(1). Wait S(1)=2, so C_0(1)=2 +1 -1=2? Wait earlier formula was C_j(m)=S(m) + (j +1)*m -1. For m=1, S(m)=2, so C_j(1)=2 + (j+1)*1 -1=2 +j. For j=0 to 5: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which are the corners for ring m=1. So for example, the corner C_0(1)=2, which is on the first side. The inward neighbor of this number would be the center, which is 1. The outward neighbor would be the next corner on that radius, which for m=2 would be C_0(2)= S(2) +1*2 -1. S(2) is 2 +3*2*(2-1)=2 +6=8. Wait no:

Wait earlier formula for S(m) is 2 + 3m(m-1). For m=2, S(2)=2 +3*2*(2-1)=2+6=8. Then C_0(2)=S(2) + (0+1)*2 -1=8 +2 -1=9. So the corner C_0(2)=9. Therefore, the inward neighbor of 9 is 2, and the outward neighbor would be on the next ring. So the difference between the corner on ring m and the inward corner is 9 - 2 =7, which is equal to the total numbers in ring m=1 (which is 6 numbers) +1? Not sure.

But perhaps the inward neighbor of a corner on ring m is the same corner on ring m-1. So for our number N which is on a side of ring m, if it is aligned with a radius (i.e., it is a corner), its inward neighbor is the corresponding corner on ring m-1.

For our number N=2026, which is on side j=2 at position p=22, not a corner, we need to find its inward neighbor. To do this, perhaps it's located along the same "arm" of the hexagon, p steps inward.

But how to calculate that?

For a number on side j at position p on ring m, its inward neighbor is the number on ring m-1, side j at position p. Is that possible?

Wait, for example, take the first number on side j=0 on ring m=2, which is 8. Its inward neighbor would be the number on ring m=1, side j=0 at position p=... Well, ring m=1 side j=0 has numbers from S(1)=2 to C_0(1)=2 + (0+1)*1 -1=2 +1 -1=2. Wait, only one number? So side j=0 on ring m=1 is just [2]. Therefore, inward neighbor of 8 would be 2. Which is correct.

Another example, take the second number on side j=0 of ring m=2. Wait side j=0 has m=2 numbers: from S(2)=8 to C_0(2)=8 + (0+1)*2 -1=8 +1=9. So numbers 8 and 9. The inward neighbor of 9 would be the number on ring m=1, side j=0 at position p=...? But ring m=1 side j=0 only has 1 number (2). So maybe not the same side? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps inward movement depends on the side.

Alternatively, think of the inward neighbor of N as follows: for a number on side j at position p of ring m, its inward neighbor is at corner C_{j}(m-1) + p.

Wait for example, for N=9 on ring m=2, side j=0 at position p=1 (since S(2)=8, the numbers on side j=0 are 8 (p=0) and 9 (p=1)). The inward neighbor would be on ring m=1, side j=0's corner, which is C_0(1)=2, plus p=1? But C_0(1) + p=2 +1=3. Is 3 adjacent to 9? In the example given, 3 is adjacent to 2 (center) and 4 and 10. 9 is adjacent to 2 and 3 and 15? Maybe not directly. So this seems incorrect.

Alternatively, inward neighbor is corner C_j(m-1) - p?

For N=9, which is on side j=0 of ring m=2, p=1. The inward neighbor would be C_0(m-1) - p= C_0(1) - p=2 -1=1. Which is the center, adjacent to 9? From the example, 9 is on the first ring's side? Actually, no, ring m=2, number 9 is on ring m=2. Its inward neighbor should be towards the center. But according to this formula it's 1. Which is two steps away. Wait maybe multiple steps? Probably this approach isn't working.

Perhaps need to think differently. For any number N on ring m, there's a unique number on ring m-1 that is adjacent to it, and vice versa for outward.

Let me think about the numbers on the same axial line.

For example, consider the axial line from center to the corner C_0(m). Along this line, the numbers would be:

- Center:1

- C_0(1)=2

- C_0(2)=9

- C_0(3)=?

Let me calculate for m=3, S(3)=2 +3*3*(3-1)= 2 + 18=20. Then C_0(3)= S(3) + (0 +1)*3 -1=20 +3 -1=22. So numbers along this line are 1,2,9,22,...

So the difference between m and m+1 is 9-2=7, 22-9=13, etc. Not consistent.

But if I want to find the inward neighbor of a number on this line, it's the previous one. For example, inward neighbor of 22 is 9, inward neighbor of 9 is 2, etc.

But for a number not on this line, how do we find its inward neighbor?

Maybe for any number N on side j at position p of ring m, the inward neighbor is the number N - some value. If I can figure out what that value is.

Alternatively, notice that each ring m has a maximum number of 1 + 3m(m+1). The inward ring is m-1 with maximum 1 + 3(m-1)m.

But how to get from N to its inward neighbor.

Alternatively, consider that moving inward from a number reduces its distance from the center. In terms of numbering, each ring's numbers are larger than the previous. So going inward would mean subtracting some amount.

But what amount?

Let me consider the number at the end of side j in ring m, which is C_j(m). Its inward neighbor is C_j(m-1). For example, C_j(2)=9, inward neighbor is C_j(1)=2. The difference is 9 - 2 =7.

Similarly, for C_j(3)=22, inward neighbor is C_j(2)=9, difference 22 -9=13.

What is 7 and 13? For m=2, difference= 7= 6*(2-1) +1=6*1+1=7. For m=3, difference=6*(3-1) +1=13. Yes! So for a corner on ring m, the inward neighbor is N - [6*(m-1)+1].

Similarly, for a general number on a side, perhaps the inward neighbor is N - [something].

For example, for a number not at the corner, but at position p on side j of ring m, the difference to its inward neighbor might be based on the position p.

For example, if we think of the inward neighbor as being on the same "arm," then for a number p steps from the corner, its inward neighbor is also p steps from the inward corner.

Given that the difference between the outward corner and inward corner is 6(m-1) +1, then the inward neighbor of a number p steps from the outward corner would be inward corner + p. Therefore, the inward neighbor of N is N - [difference - p]?

Wait let me think:

Let me denote the outward corner as O = C_j(m). Its inward neighbor is I = C_j(m-1). The difference is O - I = [6(m-1)+1].

Now, suppose a number N is p steps before O on side j: N = O - p.

Then its inward neighbor would be I - p, which is C_j(m-1) - p.

Therefore, N_in = I - p = O - [O - I + p] = O - [6(m-1)+1 + p] ?

Wait maybe not. Let's take N = O - p = C_j(m) - p. Its inward neighbor is C_j(m-1) - p.

Thus, the difference between N and N_in is N - N_in = [C_j(m) - p] - [C_j(m-1) - p] = C_j(m) - C_j(m-1).

But what is C_j(m) - C_j(m-1)?

C_j(m) = S(m) + (j+1)*m -1

C_j(m-1) = S(m-1) + (j+1)*(m-1) -1

But S(m) = 2 + 3m(m-1), and S(m-1) = 2 +3(m-1)(m-2)

Therefore:

C_j(m) - C_j(m-1) = [2 + 3m(m-1) + (j+1)*m -1] - [2 +3(m-1)(m-2) + (j+1)*(m-1) -1]

Simplify:

= [2 -1 + 3m(m-1) + (j+1)m] - [2 -1 + 3(m-1)(m-2) + (j+1)(m-1)]

= [1 + 3m(m-1) + (j+1)m] - [1 + 3(m-1)(m-2) + (j+1)(m-1)]

= 3m(m-1) - 3(m-1)(m-2) + (j+1)m - (j+1)(m-1)

Factor terms:

For the first part: 3(m-1)[m - (m-2)] = 3(m-1)(2) = 6(m-1)

For the second part: (j+1)[m - (m-1)] = (j+1)(1) = j+1

Therefore total difference is 6(m-1) + (j+1)

Thus, N - N_in = 6(m-1) + (j+1)

So N_in = N - [6(m-1) + (j+1)]

Wait but earlier we thought N_in is C_j(m-1) - p, and N = C_j(m) - p, so the difference N - N_in should be C_j(m) - C_j(m-1) = 6(m-1) + (j+1). Therefore, N_in = N - [6(m-1) + (j+1)].

So for any number N on side j of ring m, its inward neighbor is N - [6(m-1) + (j+1)].

Let me test this formula with the previous example. Take N=9 on ring m=2 side j=0. We have m=2, j=0, N=9.

N_in = 9 - [6(2-1) + (0+1)] = 9 - [6 + 1] = 9 -7=2. Which is correct, as the inward neighbor of 9 is 1, wait no, 2. From earlier example, the inward neighbor of 9 is 2? Wait if 9 is on ring m=2, what is its inward neighbor? If you look at the layout provided:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Here, 9 is adjacent to 2 and 8 and ...? It might depend on the grid, but according to the formula, it's 2, which is correct if it's on the same "arm". So the inward neighbor is 2, which is correct. Another example: take N=22 on ring m=3 side j=0 (which is the corner). Its inward neighbor should be C_j(2)=9. Using the formula: N_in =22 - [6*(3-1) + (0+1)] =22 - [12 +1]=22 -13=9. Correct.

Another example: take N=2026 on ring m=26, side j=2. So N_in =2026 - [6*(26-1) + (2+1)] =2026 - [6*25 +3] =2026 - [150 +3]=2026 - 153= 2026 - 153= 1873.

Let me check if this is correct. If I can verify with another example.

Let me take smaller example: N=3 on ring m=1, side j=0, p=... Wait N=3 is on ring m=1. Its inward neighbor would be N_in =3 - [6*(1-1) + (j+1)]. Assuming side j=0 for N=3. But for m=1, j can be 0-5. Wait N=3 is on side j=1? Because for m=1, C_j(m)=S(1) + (j+1)*1 -1=2 + (j+1) -1= j+1 +1= j +2? Wait no:

Wait earlier we said C_j(m)= S(m) + (j+1)*m -1. For m=1, S(1)=2. Therefore C_j(1)=2 + (j+1)*1 -1= 2 +j +1 -1= j +2. So for j=0, C_0(1)=0 +2=2, j=1:3, j=2:4,... up to j=5:7. Therefore, N=3 is at j=1, side j=1? Wait no, the side numbers are from C_{j-1} +1 to C_j. So N=3 is on side j=1, between C_0=2 and C_1=3? No, wait C_0=2, C_1(j=1)=3. So side j=1 has numbers from C_0 +1=3 to C_1=3, which is just [3]. So N=3 is the only number on side j=1 of ring m=1. Then its inward neighbor would be N_in=3 - [6*(1-1) + (1+1)]=3 - [0 +2]=1. Correct, since 3 is adjacent to 1 (the center). Great!

So this formula seems to work. Therefore, for N=2026, inward neighbor is 2026 -153= 1873.

Now, similarly, for the outward neighbor. Probably similar formula, but adding instead of subtracting. Let me think.

If for inward neighbor we have N_in = N - [6(m-1) + (j+1)], then for outward neighbor, it would be N_out = N + [6(m+1) -1 + (j+1)]? Wait need to derive it.

Following similar logic, for outward neighbor. Suppose N is on ring m, side j. Its outward neighbor is on ring m+1, side j, at a position offset. Let me try to derive it.

Using the same logic as before, let's consider a number N on ring m, side j at position p. Its outward neighbor N_out is on ring m+1, side j at position p. The difference between N_out and N would be C_j(m+1) - C_j(m).

Using earlier difference formula, for C_j(m+1) - C_j(m) = 6(m+1 -1) + (j+1) = 6m + (j+1). Therefore, N_out = N + [6m + (j+1)].

Let me test with N=2 on ring m=1, side j=0. Its outward neighbor should be 9, as from earlier example. Using formula: N_out=2 + [6*1 + (0+1)]=2 + 6 +1=9. Correct! Another example: N=9 on ring m=2, side j=0. Outward neighbor should be 22 (C_j(3)=22). Formula gives N_out=9 + [6*2 + (0+1)]=9 +12 +1=22. Correct. So this works.

Therefore, for our N=2026 on ring m=26, side j=2, outward neighbor is N_out=2026 + [6*26 + (2+1)] = 2026 + [156 +3] = 2026 + 159= 2185. However, ring m=27 has numbers up to 1 + 3*(27)(28)=1 + 3*756=1 + 2268=2269. So 2185 is within that range, so valid.

So now, for N=2026, we have four neighbors:

- Along the side: 2025 and 2027

- On adjacent sides: need to calculate

- Inward: 1873

- Outward: 2185

Now remaining are two more neighbors on adjacent sides. Earlier I had tried a formula which gave 1981 (side j-1) and 2032 (side j+1). Let me verify those or find the correct formula.

Earlier I considered that for a number on side j at position p, the neighbor on side j-1 is C_{j-1} - p, and neighbor on side j+1 is C_j + (m - p -1). Let me test these with examples.

Take N=3 on ring m=1, side j=1, p=0 (only position). Neighbor on side j-1=0: C_{0} - p=2 - 0=2. Which is correct, as 3 is adjacent to 2. Neighbor on side j+1=2: C_j=3 + (m - p -1)=3 + (1 - 0 -1)=3 +0=3. Which is itself? That can't be. So formula is wrong here.

Wait, clearly, my previous reasoning for neighbors on adjacent sides is flawed. Let's think differently.

In the example of N=3 on ring m=1 side j=1, its neighbors on the same ring are 2 (previous side), 4, and others? In the given diagram, 3 is adjacent to 2, 1, 4, and ... Let me check the provided diagram:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

From the diagram, 3 is adjacent to 2, 1, 4, and 10. Wait, 10 is on the next ring? Or is it on the same ring?

In the first ring (m=1), numbers are from 2 to 7. 10 is on ring m=2. So for number 3, the neighbors on the same ring would be 2, 4, and 1 (the center)? Wait in hex grid, each cell has six neighbors. But since 3 is on ring m=1, inward neighbor is 1, outward neighbor would be on next ring. The other three neighbors are on the same ring.

From the diagram, 3 is adjacent to 2, 4, and 5? Wait the diagram has ... 4 3 10 ... and ... 5 1 2 9 ... So maybe 3 is adjacent to 2, 4, and 5. Then also ... maybe 6? Not sure without clearer diagram. But let's trust the formula.

Alternatively, let's use the earlier idea that for a number on side j at position p, the two diagonal neighbors on adjacent sides are C_{j-1} - p and C_j + (m - p -1). For N=3 on ring m=1, side j=1, p=0.

C_{j-1}=C_0=2. So neighbor on side j-1 is 2 - 0 =2. Correct. For neighbor on side j+1=2: C_j=3, m=1, so 3 + (1 - 0 -1)=3 +0=3. Which is itself, which is incorrect. So this suggests the formula is incorrect.

Alternative idea: the neighbor on side j+1 would be C_j + 1 + p. Let's try: for N=3, C_j=3, side j+1 starts at C_j +1=4, then neighbor would be 4 + p=4 +0=4. Which is correct, as 3 is adjacent to 4. So maybe the formula for neighbor on side j+1 is C_j +1 + p. For N=3, it gives 4, which is correct. For N=9 (ring m=2, side j=0, p=1), C_j=9, neighbor on side j+1 would be 9 +1 +1=11. Let's check if 9 is adjacent to 11. From the diagram, 9 is on the end of side j=0 (first side) of ring m=2, which is adjacent to the start of side j=1, which is 2004 for m=26... Wait example with N=9. Let me imagine ring m=2. The numbers are from 8 to 19. If 9 is on side j=0, and side j=1 starts at 10? Let's compute corners for m=2: S(2)=8. C_0=8 + (0+1)*2 -1=8 +1=9. C_1=8 + 2*2 -1=8+3=11. Wait no: C_j(m)=S(m) + (j+1)*m -1. So for m=2, S=8, C_0=8 + (0+1)*2 -1=8 +2 -1=9. C_1=8 + (1+1)*2 -1=8 +4 -1=11. C_2=8 + (2+1)*2 -1=8 +6 -1=13, and so on up to C_5=8 +6*2 -1=8 +12 -1=19. Therefore, side j=0: numbers from 8 to 9. side j=1: 10 to 11. So neighbor of 9 on side j=1 is 10. But according to formula C_j +1 + p= C_0 +1 + p. Wait j=0 for N=9, so neighbor on side j+1=1 is C_j(m) +1 + p=9 +1 +1=11. But 11 is on side j=1's end. However, the neighbor should be 10. So formula gives 11, which is not correct. So formula is incorrect.

Alternative idea: neighbor on side j+1 is C_j(m) + 1 - p? For N=3 on side j=1, p=0: C_j=3, C_j +1 - p=3+1-0=4, which is correct. For N=9, C_j=9, +1 -p=9+1 -1=9, which is not correct. Hmm.

Alternative approach: neighbor on side j+1 is the number that is directly adjacent when moving from side j to j+1. For the first number on side j, it is adjacent to the last number on side j+1. For example, the first number on side j=1 is adjacent to the last number on side j=0. Wait this is getting too abstract.

Perhaps I should recall that on a hexagonal grid, each hex has six neighbors, and for a number on a side of a ring, two of its neighbors are on the same side, one inward, one outward, and two on adjacent sides. These two on adjacent sides can be determined by looking at the directions.

Alternatively, think of directions in terms of the six corners. For a number on side j of ring m, the two adjacent sides are j-1 and j+1. The numbers on these sides that are adjacent to N would be located at certain positions.

If our number N is on side j at position p, then the adjacent numbers on side j-1 and j+1 can be calculated by looking at how far along those sides.

Since we know the corners, maybe think in terms of the following: moving from side j to side j-1, the adjacent number would be p steps from the corner C_{j-1} on side j-1. Similarly for side j+1.

Wait earlier we thought that the neighbor on side
