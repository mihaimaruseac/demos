Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 on this hexagonal spiral. Let me start by understanding how the spiral is structured. 

First, I remember that in a hexagonal grid, each number is surrounded by six neighbors. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and then expands outward in layers. Let me visualize the grid given in the problem:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So, the numbers spiral out in a hexagonal pattern. For example, 1 is in the center. Moving clockwise around it, we can see 2, 9, 8, 7, 6, 15, 14... etc. But the exact structure might be a bit more complex because of the hexagonal grid versus the square grid. 

First, maybe I need to figure out how the numbers are arranged in layers. In a square spiral, each layer is a ring around the center, but in a hexagonal spiral, I believe each layer adds a ring of hexagons around the previous ones. 

Let me recall that in a hexagonal grid, the number of cells in each concentric ring can be calculated. For a hexagonal grid, starting from the center (which is ring 0 with 1 cell), each subsequent ring n has 6n cells. For example, ring 1 has 6*1 = 6 cells, ring 2 has 6*2 = 12 cells, ring 3 has 18 cells, etc. 

Therefore, the total number of cells up to and including ring n is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1). 

Let me check this formula. For n=0, it's 1. For n=1, it's 1 + 3*1*2 = 1 + 6 = 7. Which makes sense because the central cell plus 6 in the first ring. For n=2, it's 1 + 3*2*3 = 19. The second ring would have 12 cells, so 7 + 12 = 19. That seems correct. 

So, if I can find which ring the number 2026 is in, then figure out where exactly it is within that ring, and then determine its neighbors. 

First step: Find the ring number for 2026. 

Let me denote the total numbers up to ring n as T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1). 

So, I need to find n such that T(n-1) < 2026 ≤ T(n). 

Let me solve for n in T(n) ≈ 2026. 

So, 1 + 3n(n+1) ≈ 2026

Which simplifies to 3n² + 3n + 1 ≈ 2026

Let me ignore the smaller terms for estimating:

3n² ≈ 2025 ⇒ n² ≈ 675 ⇒ n ≈ sqrt(675) ≈ 25.98. So n is approximately 26. 

Let me check T(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

Then T(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 

Therefore, 2026 is in ring n=26, since T(25)=1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107=T(26). 

So, ring 26 has numbers from T(25) + 1 = 1952 up to T(26) = 2107. 

So, the position of 2026 within ring 26 is 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in ring 26. 

Wait, because T(n-1) is 1 + 3(n-1)n. For n=26, T(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1951. Therefore, position within ring is 2026 - 1951 = 75. 

But each ring has 6n cells, which for n=26, is 6*26 = 156. So the 75th number is in the middle of ring 26. 

Now, in a hexagonal spiral, each ring is divided into six "sides", each side having n numbers. For ring n, each side has n numbers. So for ring 26, each side has 26 numbers. 

Therefore, the positions in ring 26 can be divided into six sides, each of 26 numbers. 

So, to figure out which side 2026 is on, we can compute the position within the ring: pos_in_ring = 75. 

Since each side has 26 numbers, we can divide 75 by 26 to find which side it's on. 

75 divided by 26 is 2 with a remainder of 75 - 2*26 = 75 - 52 = 23. 

Wait, 26*2 = 52, 26*3 = 78. 75 is between 52 and 78, so it is on the third side (since the first side is positions 1-26, second side 27-52, third side 53-78). 

But the remainder is 75 - 2*26 = 75 - 52 = 23. Wait, actually, if we use ceiling or zero-based indexing? Hmm. 

Let me think. Let me index sides starting from 0 to 5. Each side has length 26. 

But perhaps more accurately, since each ring has six sides, each of length n. 

Therefore, if the position_in_ring starts at 1, then the first side is positions 1 to 26, second side 27-52, third 53-78, fourth 79-104, fifth 105-130, sixth 131-156. 

Therefore, position 75 is in the third side (positions 53-78). 

So, the position along the third side is 75 - (53 - 1) = 75 - 52 = 23. Wait, no. If the third side starts at position 53, then the offset from the start of the side is 75 - 52 = 23? Wait, 53 to 78 is 26 numbers. So 75 - 53 + 1 = 23rd position on the third side? 

Wait, if the first position on the third side is 53, then position 53 is offset 1, 54 is offset 2,... 75 is offset 75 - 53 + 1 = 23. So yes, the 23rd element on the third side. 

Therefore, 2026 is located on the third side of ring 26, at the 23rd position from the start of that side. 

Now, to find the neighbors, I need to figure out the coordinates or the relative positions in the grid. 

But maybe there's a way to calculate the numbers around 2026 by understanding the numbering pattern. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to model the coordinates of each number in the spiral. 

But how?

In hexagonal grids, coordinates can be represented in axial coordinates or axial with offset. But perhaps for this problem, a more intuitive approach is needed.

Alternatively, since each ring is a layer around the center, and each side can be thought of as moving in a certain direction. 

Perhaps I can figure out the starting number of each ring and each side. 

First, let's note that the numbers in ring n start at T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? Wait no. Wait T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1). Therefore, T(n-1) = 1 + 3(n-1)n. Therefore, the first number of ring n is T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? No, wait:

Wait T(n) is total numbers up to ring n. Therefore, the first number in ring n is T(n-1) + 1. For example, ring 1 starts at T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, but according to the grid given, the numbers around 1 (center) are 2, 3,... up to 7, then 8, etc. Let me check.

Wait when n=1 (first ring), numbers from T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 to T(1) = 7. So numbers 2 to 7. Which is six numbers. Which matches with the given example. For example, the numbers around 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8? Wait in the given grid, the numbers adjacent to 1 are 2, 5, 6, 7, maybe? Wait in the grid given:

Looking at the center cell 1, the neighbors should be 2, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5? 

Wait let me reconstruct the grid given in the problem:

The first few lines:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So if we imagine the hexagonal grid, each layer adds a ring around the previous one. The center is 1. Moving clockwise, the numbers adjacent to 1 should be 2, 9, 8, 7, 6, 15, 14... 

So, in the first ring (n=1), numbers from 2 to 7. Then in the second ring (n=2), from 8 to 19? Wait T(2) = 1 + 3*2*3 = 19. So numbers from T(1)+1=7+1=8 up to 19. 

So in the given grid, the second ring is starting at 8. The numbers given go up to 16. 

But perhaps the way to find the neighbors is by figuring out how numbers are placed along each side of the ring.

Let me think of each ring as having six sides. For each side, as we move along it, the numbers increase by a certain step. 

First, let's think about the first ring (n=1). It has six numbers: 2 to 7. Each side has one number. 

But in the given example, moving from 2 to 9 (which is in the next ring). 

But maybe for higher rings, each side of the ring is a straight line in the hexagonal grid, and as you move along the side, the numbers increase by a certain amount.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the starting number of each ring and each side, and then compute the numbers along the side. 

Let me try to find the starting number of each ring. 

The starting number of ring n is S(n) = T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? Wait no. Wait T(n-1) = 1 + 3(n-1)n. Then S(n) = T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? No, no, T(n-1) is already the total up to ring n-1. So S(n) is T(n-1) + 1 = [1 + 3(n-1)n] + 1? No, wait:

Wait T(n) is the total number of numbers up to ring n. So if we have ring 0 with 1 number, then ring 1 adds 6*1=6 numbers. So the starting number of ring 1 is 2 (as T(0) = 1). Similarly, the starting number of ring n is T(n-1) + 1. 

So for example:

- Ring 0: S(0) = 1 (just number 1)
- Ring 1: S(1) = T(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- Ring 2: S(2) = T(1) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8
- Ring 3: S(3) = T(2) + 1 = 19 + 1 = 20
- And so on.

So, for ring n, S(n) = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? Wait no. Wait T(n-1) is 1 + 3(n-1)(n). Therefore S(n)=T(n-1)+1=1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? No, T(n-1) is 1 + 3(n-1)n, so adding 1 would be T(n-1)+1=2 + 3(n-1)n. 

Wait for n=1, S(1)=T(0) + 1 = [1] + 1 = 2. Which matches. For n=2, T(1)=1 + 3*1*2=7, so S(2)=7 + 1=8. Correct. For n=3, T(2)=1 + 3*2*3=19, so S(3)=20. So yes, S(n) = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? No, it's T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1? Wait, T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1). Therefore, T(n-1) = 1 + 3(n-1)(n). Therefore, S(n) = T(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(n^2 -n) + 1 = 2 + 3n(n - 1). So yes, for example, for n=1, 2 + 3*1*(0) = 2 + 0 = 2. 

Therefore, the starting number of ring n is S(n) = 2 + 3n(n - 1). 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about the numbers on each side of the ring. 

For example, each side of the ring will have numbers increasing by a certain value. For example, in the first ring (n=1), each side has 1 number. The numbers go from 2 to 7. 

But moving to the second ring (n=2). Starting at 8. Each side has 2 numbers. 

If I can figure out what numbers are on each side, I can find where 2026 is, and then figure out its neighbors. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the starting number of each side in the ring. 

Each ring has six sides. Let me think about how numbers progress when moving from one ring to another. 

When you complete a ring and start the next one, you move in a certain direction. Each side of the ring is a straight line in the hexagonal grid. 

In the square spiral, each layer adds numbers in a predictable pattern, but in the hex grid, since it's six directions, it might be more complex. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula for the numbers on each side of the ring. 

Let me think about the starting number of each ring and each side. 

Let me take an example: ring n. Starting number is S(n) = 2 + 3n(n-1). 

Each side of the ring has n numbers. For example, ring 1 (n=1): starting at S(1)=2, with one number per side. 

In the hexagonal grid, moving around the ring, each side is a different direction. 

But perhaps the numbers on a side can be determined based on the ring number and the position on the side. 

Let me consider that when moving along a side of the ring, the numbers increase by 6n - something? 

Alternatively, perhaps it's helpful to consider that each side of the ring corresponds to a direction in the hexagonal grid, and the numbers on that side can be calculated based on the starting number of the ring and the side. 

Alternatively, maybe I can figure out what the number is at the beginning of each side of the ring. 

For example, ring n has six sides. Let's denote them as Side 0 to Side 5. 

Assuming that the ring starts at Side 0, and each subsequent side is numbered incrementally. 

So, the starting number of ring n is S(n). The first side (Side 0) has n numbers. Then Side 1 starts at S(n) + n, and has n numbers, and so on. 

Therefore, the starting number for each side i in ring n is: S(n) + i * n. 

Wait let me check with n=1. 

For ring n=1, S(n)=2. 

Side 0: starts at 2, has 1 number: 2.

Side 1: starts at 2 + 1*1 = 3, has 1 number: 3.

Side 2: starts at 2 + 2*1 = 4.

Side 3: starts at 5.

Side 4: 6.

Side 5: 7.

Then, the sides go from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which are the six numbers in the first ring. That seems correct. 

For ring n=2, starting number S(2) = 2 + 3*2*(2-1) = 2 + 3*2*1 = 8. Then, each side starts at 8 + i*2 for i=0,...,5. 

So sides start at:

Side 0: 8

Side 1: 8 + 2 = 10

Side 2: 12

Side 3: 14

Side 4: 16

Side 5: 18

Then, each side has n=2 numbers. So for example, side 0 has numbers 8 and 9, then side 1 has 10 and 11, ..., side 5 has 18 and 19. 

But according to T(n) formula, T(2)=19, which is correct. 

Looking back at the given grid snippet:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So in the second ring, the numbers start at 8. For example, the bottom row shows ... 16 6 7 8. Wait maybe that's the start of the second ring? Not sure, but the numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. 

But in our example, side 0 (starting at 8) has 8 and 9. Side 1 (starting at 10) has 10 and 11. Side 2 (starting at 12) has 12 and 13, side 3 (starting at 14) has 14 and 15, side 4 (starting at 16) has 16 and 17, side 5 (starting at 18) has 18 and 19. 

Looking at the grid given, in the top line, there's a 14 and 10. In another line, 15 and 16. 

So, that seems to fit. For example, 14 is the start of side 3 (positions 14,15). 15 is next to it. 16 is the start of side 4. 

So, this seems to work. Therefore, the starting number of each side i of ring n is S(n) + i * n.

Therefore, in general, for any ring n and side i, the starting number is:

StartingSide(n, i) = S(n) + i * n = [2 + 3n(n - 1)] + i * n.

Once the starting number of a side is known, the numbers along that side increase by 1 as we move along the side. 

For example, in ring n, side i, the numbers are StartingSide(n, i), StartingSide(n, i) + 1, ..., StartingSide(n, i) + (n - 1).

Thus, for ring n, each side i has n numbers starting at StartingSide(n, i). 

Therefore, given that 2026 is in ring n=26, on the third side (i=2?), wait earlier we said it is on the third side (positions 53-78 in ring 26). Wait how were the sides numbered?

Earlier, for the position within ring 26, pos_in_ring = 75. 

Since each side has 26 numbers, sides are:

Side 0: 1 - 26

Side 1: 27 - 52

Side 2: 53 - 78

Side 3: 79 - 104

Side 4: 105 - 130

Side 5: 131 - 156

So 75 is in Side 2 (indices 53-78). Therefore, i=2 (assuming starting from 0). 

Therefore, the starting number of side 2 in ring 26 is StartingSide(26, 2) = [2 + 3*26*(26 - 1)] + 2*26.

Compute that:

First compute 3*26*25:

3*26=78; 78*25 = 1950. Then 2 + 1950 = 1952. Then adding 2*26 = 52. So 1952 + 52 = 2004. 

Therefore, StartingSide(26, 2) = 2004. 

So, side 2 of ring 26 starts at 2004, and has 26 numbers: 2004, 2005,...,2004 + 25 = 2029. 

Therefore, position 53 (start of side 2) corresponds to 2004, then position 54 is 2005,..., position 53 + k -1 = 2004 + k -1.

So, the offset within side 2 is pos_in_side = 75 - 52 = 23? Wait since pos_in_ring = 75, and side starts at pos 53. So offset is 75 - 53 + 1 = 23? Wait, if position 53 is offset 1 on the side, then position 53 is 2004 + 0 = 2004. Position 53 + k -1 is offset k. Therefore, the value at pos_in_ring = 53 + (k -1) is 2004 + (k -1). Therefore, if pos_in_ring is 75, which is 53 + (k -1) => k -1 = 75 -53=22 => k=23. Therefore, the number is 2004 + 22 = 2026. 

Yes! Therefore, 2026 is located at offset 23 on side 2 of ring 26. 

So now, I need to find the six neighbors of 2026 in the hexagonal grid. 

In the hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. Depending on where exactly 2026 is located in the ring, its neighbors will be in different positions. 

However, since the grid is a spiral, the neighbors could be in the same ring or adjacent rings. 

But perhaps we can find their positions based on the ring and side information. 

First, let's think about the structure. 

In a hexagonal spiral, moving along a side, the neighbors would be:

- The previous number on the same side (if exists)

- The next number on the same side (if exists)

- Two neighbors from the previous side of the same ring

- Two neighbors from the next side of the same ring? Or maybe from adjacent rings?

Wait perhaps it's better to think in terms of directions. 

Alternatively, perhaps for numbers that are not at the corners (i.e., not at the start or end of a side), they have neighbors:

- One behind on the same side (i.e., previous number), 

- One ahead on the same side (next number),

- Two neighbors from the previous ring (inside),

- And two neighbors from the next ring (outside)?

Wait no, maybe not. It depends on the position in the ring. 

Alternatively, given that we have the exact position (ring 26, side 2, offset 23 from the start of the side), we can figure out the relative positions. 

But maybe there's a pattern here. 

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as coordinates. 

Alternatively, let's consider the movement in the hexagonal grid. In hex grids, there are six directions. As we move along a side of a ring, the direction is constant. When you complete a side, you turn 60 degrees and continue. 

But perhaps for our problem, we can note that each number in a side has neighbors in specific directions. For example, if a number is not at the start of a side, then moving backward along the side gives one neighbor, and forward gives another. The other four neighbors are in other directions. 

But perhaps it's easier to think about the numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that each corner of a ring connects to the next ring. 

But I need to think of a way to calculate the numbers. 

Given that 2026 is on side 2 of ring 26, with offset 23. Let me think about what the neighbors are. 

First, same ring neighbors:

- On the same side: the previous number is 2026 - 1 = 2025, and the next number is 2027. But only if we are not at the end of the side. 

Since we are on offset 23 of side 2, which has 26 numbers. Therefore, offset 23 is less than 26, so the next number (2027) is on the same side. The previous number (2025) is also on the same side. 

Then, there are neighbors on adjacent sides. However, when moving from one side to another, there is a corner. For example, the end of side 2 connects to the start of side 3. 

But since 2026 is in the middle of side 2, not at the end, the neighbors from adjacent sides would be... Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the other four neighbors are in the previous ring (ring 25) and the next ring (ring 27)? 

Wait, no, neighbors in the same ring. 

Wait in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For a cell on a side, three of the neighbors are in the same ring, and the other three may be in adjacent rings? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think of how numbers are placed in the spiral. 

Let me consider that for numbers not at the start or end of a side, their neighbors along the ring would be:

- One before (in same side),

- One after (in same side),

- One from the previous side (same ring, previous side),

- One from the next side (same ring, next side),

- Two others?

Wait maybe not. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number on a side can be determined by looking at the corners of the ring. 

Let me think: 

Each ring has six corners, which are the last number of each side. 

For example, in ring 26, side 0 ends at S(n) + n - 1 = StartingSide(n,0) + n -1 = [S(n) + 0 * n] + n -1 = S(n) + n -1. 

Similarly, side 1 ends at StartingSide(n,1) + n -1 = [S(n) + 1 * n] + n -1 = S(n) + 2n -1. 

Wait for ring n, the last number of side i is StartingSide(n, i) + n -1 = [S(n) + i * n] + n -1 = S(n) + (i + 1) * n - 1. 

But maybe I need to find the numbers at the corners. 

Alternatively, think of moving from one side to another. When you are on side i, moving along it, when you reach the end (offset n) you turn towards the next side. 

But for our case, since we're not at the end, maybe the neighbors in the same ring are the ones adjacent along the side, and the ones adjacent on the adjacent sides? 

But how?

Alternatively, maybe think of the numbering pattern. For example, if we are on side i of ring n, then there's a diagonal direction that connects to the previous ring. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to think of the formula for numbers on corners. 

For example, the first corner of the ring (end of side 0) is S(n) + n - 1. 

Similarly, the second corner (end of side 1) is S(n) + n -1 + n = S(n) + 2n -1, etc. 

But what is the relationship between numbers on corners and their neighbors? 

Alternatively, maybe consider that each number in the ring is located at a certain distance from the center and has certain coordinates. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that moving from one ring to the next, there's a certain increment. 

But maybe I need another approach. 

Since I have determined that 2026 is located on side 2 of ring 26, at offset 23. 

Let me try to figure out the numbers adjacent to it in the grid.

First, the immediate neighbors along the side:

- Previous number: 2026 - 1 = 2025.

- Next number: 2026 + 1 = 2027.

Then, there are four other neighbors. 

In the hexagonal grid, moving from a cell, there are six directions. Assuming that we are on a side of a ring, two of the neighbors are adjacent along the side. The other four are in other directions. Two of them are inside the ring (towards the center), and two are outside (away from the center). Wait but since we're on ring 26, moving outward would be to ring 27, and inward to ring 25. 

But how to compute the numbers?

Alternatively, if we can figure out the difference between numbers in certain directions. 

For example, in the given grid:

Looking at number 2 (which is on side 0 of ring 1, offset 1). Its neighbors include 1 (center) and 9 (which is in ring 2, side ...). 

From the grid provided, 2 is adjacent to 1, 9, and maybe others. 

Looking at the sample grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So neighbors of 2 (which is at position ... 2 9 ...): neighbors would be 1, 9, and numbers above, below, and in other directions. From the grid, it seems 2 is adjacent to 1, 9, 3, 4, 5, and maybe  something else? Wait in the grid, moving clockwise around 2, there's 1 (center), then 9, then 3, then maybe  something else?

Wait perhaps this is too vague. 

Alternatively, think of the difference between numbers in certain directions. 

For example, moving from a number on a side in the ring outward to the next ring: 

What is the difference? Let me take an example. 

Take number 2 (ring 1, side 0, offset 1). The number outward in the same direction would be the start of side 0 in the next ring (ring 2), which is 8. So difference is 8 - 2 = 6. 

Another example: number 7 (end of side 1 in ring 1). The next number outward would be 19 (end of side 5 in ring 2?) Wait no. Wait the end of side 0 in ring 2 is 9, side 1 is 11, side 2 is 13, side 3 is 15, side 4 is 17, side 5 is 19. So the end of side 5 (ring 2) is 19. So number 7 (end of side 1 in ring 1) is adjacent to the start of side 2 in ring 2? Let me check. 

If number 7 is the end of side 1 in ring 1 (which for n=1, side 1 starts at 3 and ends at 3 + 1 -1 = 3). Wait no, ring 1, side 1 starts at S(n) + i*n = 2 + 1*1 = 3. Since each side has n=1 number. Therefore, end of side 1 is 3 + 1 -1 = 3. Wait that can't be. Wait for ring n=1, side 0 has numbers from 2 to 2 + 1 -1 = 2. Side 1 has from 2 + 1*1=3 to 3 + 1 -1=3. So each side has one number. Therefore, the corner between side 0 and side 1 is 2 (end of side 0) and 3 (start of side 1). 

But number 7 is the end of side 5 in ring 1. Which is in the position of side 5, offset 1 (since n=1). Therefore, the number after that would be the start of side 0 in ring 2, which is 8. 

So difference is 8 - 7 = 1. 

But 7 is adjacent to 8? In the grid, 7 is adjacent to 8, which is correct. 

Another example: number 9 is in ring 2, side 0, offset 2 (since side 0 starts at 8, and has numbers 8 and 9). The outward neighbor of 9 would be the start of side 0 in ring 3. Starting number of ring 3 is S(3)=2 + 3*3*(3-1)=2 + 3*3*2= 2 + 18=20. So start of side 0 of ring 3 is 20. Therefore, difference is 20 - 9 = 11. 

But is 9 adjacent to 20? Not sure. It depends on the grid. 

But maybe there's a pattern in the differences. 

Alternatively, maybe when you move from a corner to the next ring, you have a certain difference. 

But perhaps for our problem, instead of trying to find general rules, we can use coordinates. 

Let me try to assign coordinates to the numbers. 

In hexagonal grids, one way to assign coordinates is using axial coordinates (q, r, s) with q + r + s = 0. But that might be complicated. 

Alternatively, I can think of the grid as having a coordinate system where moving in six directions corresponds to increments in different directions. 

But maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since we know the ring number and the position on the ring, perhaps we can determine the differences between 2026 and its neighbors. 

Let me think: 

First, the two neighbors along the same side: 2025 and 2027. That's straightforward. 

Then, there are four other neighbors. Let's try to find them. 

First, moving inward (towards the previous ring, ring 25). How much do we subtract?

When moving inward from a position in ring n to ring n-1, the difference might depend on the direction. 

Similarly, moving outward to ring n+1, difference would depend on direction. 

But since we're not at a corner, how can we find these differences? 

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the numbers at the "ends" of the side, and then see the pattern. 

For our case, in ring 26, side 2, which starts at 2004 and ends at 2004 + 25 = 2029. 

Therefore, the first number on this side is 2004, and the last is 2029. 

Now, the number before this side, i.e., at the corner between side 1 and side 2 of ring 26 is the last number of side 1. 

Side 1 starts at S(n) + i*n = S(n) + 1*n = [2 + 3n(n-1)] + n = 2 + 3n(n -1) + n = 2 + 3n² - 3n + n = 2 + 3n² - 2n. 

But since side 1 has n numbers, the last number of side 1 is SideStart + n -1 = [2 + 3n(n-1) + n ] + n -1 = 2 + 3n(n -1) + n + n -1 = 2 + 3n(n -1) + 2n -1. 

Alternatively, since the starting number of side 2 is 2004, the starting number of side 1 is 2004 - n = 2004 - 26 = 1978. Therefore, the last number of side 1 is 1978 + 26 -1 = 1978 + 25 = 2003. 

Therefore, the corner between side 1 and 2 is 2003, and the next number (start of side 2) is 2004. 

Similarly, the corner between side 2 and 3 is the last number of side 2, which is 2004 + 26 -1 = 2029. 

Therefore, if we are somewhere on side 2 (say, number x), then the numbers adjacent to x perpendicular to the side would be:

- When moving inward from x, towards ring 25

- When moving outward from x, towards ring 27

Also, numbers adjacent along the ring in the previous and next sides? 

But how to calculate them?

Alternatively, consider that each corner connects to the next ring. For example, the corner at 2003 (end of side 1) connects to some number in ring 25, and the corner at 2029 (end of side 2) connects to some number in ring 27? 

But not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a formula to compute the number that is k steps in a certain direction from a given number. 

Alternatively, think about the relationship between numbers in the same direction from the center. 

Alternatively, since we know that moving from one ring to the next in the same direction adds a certain value. 

For example, in the first ring, the number 2 is on side 0, direction 0. The number directly outward from it in ring 2, same direction is 8, then outward again in ring 3 would be 20, etc. 

Looking at these numbers: 2, 8, 20, ... 

The differences between them are 6, 12, ... 

Which is 6*1, 6*2, ... 

Similarly, for the next direction, side 1 start: 3, 10, ... 

Difference is 7, then what? Let me see:

For ring n=1, side 1 starts at 3 (ring 1). For ring n=2, side 1 starts at S(2) + 1*2 = 8 + 2 = 10. Then for ring n=3, starting number S(3)=20, side 1 starts at 20 + 1*3 = 23. So the difference between ring 2 and ring 1 for this direction is 10 - 3 = 7, and between ring 3 and ring 2 is 23 - 10 = 13. 

Similarly, the next difference would be 23 + something? 

But maybe there's a pattern here. 

Alternatively, the difference between StartSide(n, i) and StartSide(n-1, i) is something. 

StartSide(n, i) - StartSide(n-1, i) = [2 + 3n(n - 1) + i * n] - [2 + 3(n - 1)(n - 2) + i*(n - 1)].

Let me compute that:

First term: 2 + 3n(n - 1) + i n

Minus: 2 + 3(n-1)(n - 2) + i(n - 1)

So subtract:

[3n(n - 1) - 3(n - 1)(n - 2)] + i[n - (n - 1)] 

Factor out 3(n - 1):

3(n - 1)[n - (n - 2)] + i(1)

Simplify inside the brackets: n - n + 2 = 2

So 3(n - 1)(2) + i = 6(n - 1) + i 

Therefore, StartSide(n, i) - StartSide(n-1, i) = 6(n - 1) + i 

Therefore, for a given direction i, moving outward from ring n-1 to ring n along the same direction adds 6(n - 1) + i. 

For example, take n=2, i=0: difference is 6*(2-1) + 0 = 6*1 + 0 = 6. Which matches 8 - 2 = 6.

For n=2, i=1: difference is 6*(2 -1) +1 = 7. Which matches 10 - 3 = 7.

For n=3, i=1: difference is 6*(3 -1) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. 23 - 10 = 13. Correct. 

Great! Therefore, we have a formula for moving outward in direction i: adding 6(n -1) + i. 

Similarly, moving inward from ring n to ring n-1 in the same direction would subtract 6(n - 1) + i. 

But wait, but the problem is we are not at the start of the side, we are at some offset. 

So if we take a number x located in ring n, side i, offset k, then the number that is outward in the same direction from x would be x + [something]. 

Similarly, inward would be x - [something]. 

But what is that something?

Since the difference from StartSide(n, i) to StartSide(n+1, i) is 6n + i. 

But how does it relate to the offset k? 

Let me think. Suppose I have a number x on side i of ring n, at offset k (so x = StartSide(n, i) + k - 1). 

If I want to find the number in the outward direction from x, which is along the same direction. How much do I add? 

Well, if I move from ring n to ring n+1 along the same direction, the starting number increases by 6n + i. But if I am at offset k on side i of ring n, then the corresponding number on ring n+1 in the same direction would be StartSide(n+1, i) + k -1, provided that k <= length of the side in ring n+1, which is (n+1). Since the sides increase in length as rings increase. 

Wait, for example, if n=2, side i=0, offset k=1 (which is 8). Moving outward to ring 3, same direction, the number would be StartSide(3, 0) + 1 -1 = StartSide(3, 0) = 20. Which is 8 + 6*2 + 0 = 8 + 12 = 20. Correct. 

Similarly, if I am at offset k on ring n, side i, then the outward number would be x + 6n + i. 

Wait x is StartSide(n, i) + k - 1. The outward number would be StartSide(n+1, i) + k - 1. Which is [StartSide(n, i) + 6n + i] + k -1 = x + 6n + i. 

Therefore, the outward number from x is x + 6n + i. 

Similarly, the inward number would be x - [6(n-1) + i]. 

But this is only valid if x is not on the first ring (for inward) and if k <= length of the side on ring n+1 (for outward). 

In our case, x = 2026 is located in ring n=26, side i=2, offset k=23. 

So, moving outward in the same direction (direction i=2), the outward number would be x + 6*26 + 2 = 2026 + 156 + 2 = 2026 + 158 = 2184. 

Similarly, moving inward would be x - [6*(26 -1) + i] = 2026 - [6*25 + 2] = 2026 - [150 + 2] = 2026 - 152 = 1874. 

Therefore, two of the neighbors are 1874 and 2184. 

Now, the fourth and fifth neighbors. 

What about moving in directions that are adjacent to the current side? 

For example, at the corners, when you finish a side, you turn 60 degrees. The neighbors perpendicular to the side would be?

But since our number is at offset 23 on side 2 of ring 26 (which is not at the end of the side), how can we find those? 

Let me think. 

If we consider that moving from one side to the adjacent side involves a certain difference. 

For example, the end of side i is connected to the start of side i+1. 

The end of side 2 (which is our current side) is number 2029. The number after that is the start of side 3, which is StartingSide(n, 3) = 2004 + 3*26. Wait, earlier StartingSide(n, i) = S(n) + i * n. For ring 26, side 3: i=3, so StartingSide(26, 3) = 2 + 3*26*(26 - 1) + 3*26 = 2 + 3*26*25 + 3*26. Which we previously calculated for side 2 as 2004, so side 3 is 2004 + 26 = 2030. 

Therefore, the start of side 3 is 2030. 

The end of side 2 is 2029, which is adjacent to 2030. 

Similarly, the start of side 2 is 2004, adjacent to the end of side 1, which is 2003. 

But for our case, the number 2026 is in the middle of side 2. How are its neighbors connected to other sides?

Perhaps there is a diagonal neighbor from the previous side (side 1) and the next side (side 3). 

For example, if we imagine a grid, moving diagonally from our number to adjacent sides. 

But how much is that difference?

Let me think. If I move from a number on side i, offset k, towards the side i-1 or i+1, how much is the difference?

Perhaps there is a pattern here. 

Let me take an example. Take number 2 (ring 1, side 0, offset 1). Its neighbor towards side 1 would be ... in the sample grid, number 2 is adjacent to 5. Let's check:

In the given grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Looking at number 2, neighbors are 1, 9, and 5? Yes, looking at the grid... the numbers around 2 are 1 (center), then going up left is 5? Maybe not. It's hard to tell from the fragment. 

Alternatively, let's use the formulas. 

Suppose we are at number x on side i, offset k. There might be another neighbor in the ring, which is on side i-1 or i+1. 

Let me try to find the relationship. 

Imagine that from a point on side i, there's a neighbor that is one step towards side i-1 and one step towards side i+1 in the ring. 

For example, consider a cell in the middle of side i. To get to the neighbor "above" or "below" in relation to the side, we might need to go to the same offset in the adjacent sides? 

But how?

Alternatively, think about the difference between numbers on adjacent sides at the same offset. 

For instance, take side i and side i+1. If you are at offset k on side i, there might be a number at offset k on side i+1 that is a neighbor. 

But let me test with an example. 

Take ring n=2, side i=0, offset k=1: number 8. 

What would be the neighbor on side i+1=1, offset k=1: number 10. 

Is 8 adjacent to 10? In the grid, 8 is at the bottom, and 10 is... in the given grid fragment, there's a 10 on the first line. It's adjacent to 3 and ... perhaps. But whether 8 and 10 are adjacent? 

Possibly not. They could be separated by one cell. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a formula here. 

If we have a number on side i, offset k, then the number on side i+1, offset k is x + something?

Yes. Since side i+1 starts at StartingSide(n, i+1) = StartingSide(n, i) + n. 

Therefore, the number on side i+1, offset k is StartingSide(n, i) + n + (k -1) = x + n.

Where x is the number on side i, offset k: x = StartingSide(n, i) + (k -1). 

Therefore, neighbor on side i+1, same offset is x + n. 

Similarly, neighbor on side i-1, same offset is x - n. 

Let me check with an example. 

Take ring n=2, side i=0, offset k=1: x=8. Then neighbor on side i+1=1, same offset is 8 + 2 = 10. Is 8 adjacent to 10? In a hexagonal grid, if they are on adjacent sides at the same offset, they could indeed be neighbors. 

Similarly, in the given grid, number 8 is adjacent to 3 and maybe 10. In the first line of the grid, there is a ... 14 4 3 10 ..., which might be connected to 8. 

Assuming this is correct, then for a number x on side i, offset k, the numbers on side i+1 and side i-1 at the same offset are x + n and x - n respectively. 

Therefore, for our number 2026 on ring 26 (n=26), side i=2, offset k=23, the neighbors would be:

- On side i+1 (side 3) at same offset: 2026 + 26 = 2052

- On side i-1 (side 1) at same offset: 2026 - 26 = 2000

Therefore, these would be two more neighbors. 

Therefore, so far, the six neighbors would be:

1. 2025 (previous on same side)

2. 2027 (next on same side)

3. 1874 (inward)

4. 2184 (outward)

5. 2000 (side i-1, same offset)

6. 2052 (side i+1, same offset)

Let me verify with a smaller example.

Take x=8 (ring 2, side 0, offset 1):

Neighbors would be:

- previous on same side: doesn't exist (it's the first), so maybe none?

Wait, side i=0, offset k=1. Previous would be k=0, but since offset starts at 1, maybe not. 

But in this case, previous would be nothing, but next would be 9. 

Inward: x - [6*(2-1) + i=0] = 8 - [6 + 0] = 8 -6 = 2. Which is correct (8 is adjacent to 2).

Outward: x + 6*2 + 0 = 8 + 12 + 0 = 20. Which is start of side 0 in ring 3. 

Neighbor on side i+1: 8 + 2 = 10. 

Neighbor on side i-1: 8 - 2 = 6. Wait, i-1 would be side -1? No, side indices are modulo 6. 

Wait side i=0, i-1 would be side 5 (since it's a ring). Therefore, the neighbor on side i-1 (side 5) would be x - n = 8 - 2 = 6. 

Is 8 adjacent to 6? In the grid, number 8 is adjacent to 7 and 16... or maybe 6? Looking at the grid:

... 16 6 7 8 ... 

Yes, in the bottom row, 16, 6, 7, 8... So 8 is adjacent to 7 and 6. 

So, yes, x - n = 6 is a neighbor. Therefore, the formula holds. 

Therefore, in general, for any number x on side i of ring n (not at the ends of the side), its six neighbors are:

- x - 1 (previous on same side)

- x + 1 (next on same side)

- x - n (same offset on previous side)

- x + n (same offset on next side)

- x - [6(n-1) + i] (inward)

- x + [6n + i] (outward)

Therefore, for our case, x=2026, n=26, i=2:

neighbors are:

- 2025, 2027, 2000, 2052, 1874, 2184.

Therefore, the six neighbors are those. 

But need to confirm that these numbers actually exist and are valid. 

First, check if the previous and next numbers are within the same side. 

Since 2026 is offset 23 on a side of length 26, 2025 is offset 22 and 2027 is offset 24, both within the side. 

For x - n and x + n:

x - n = 2026 - 26 = 2000.

x + n = 2026 + 26 = 2052.

Are these numbers on the adjacent sides?

For x - n = 2000: 

Since x is on side 2, offset 23, 2000 is on side 1, offset 23. 

Since side 1 starts at S(n) + 1*n = 1952 + 26 = 1978 (as previously computed for side 2 starting at 2004). 

Wait earlier we said for ring 26, starting number is S(n)=1952. Then, StartingSide(n, i) = 1952 + i * 26.

For side i=1: StartingSide is 1952 + 1*26 = 1952 + 26 = 1978. Therefore, the number on side i=1, offset k=23 is 1978 + 23 -1 = 1978 + 22 = 2000. Which is correct. 

Similarly, for x + n = 2026 + 26 = 2052, which is on side i=3, offset k=23. 

StartingSide(n, 3) = 1952 + 3*26 = 1952 + 78 = 2030. Therefore, offset 23 gives 2030 + 23 -1 = 2030 + 22 = 2052. Correct. 

Then inward neighbor is 1874. 

Is that in ring 25? 

Since inward is x - [6(n-1) + i] = 2026 - [6*25 + 2] = 2026 - 152 = 1874. 

Yes, and 1874 is in ring 25. 

Similarly, outward neighbor is x + [6n + i] = 2026 + 6*26 + 2 = 2026 + 156 + 2 = 2184. 

Which is in ring 27. 

Therefore, all neighbors are valid. 

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2000, 2052, 1874, and 2184. 

Now, sum them up:

Let me compute:

First, pair them to make it easier:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2000 + 2052 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = (1800 + 2100) + (74 + 84) = 3900 + 158 = 4058

Wait, let's check:

2025 + 2027 = 2025 + 2027 = 4052.

2000 + 2052 = 4052.

1874 + 2184: 1874 + 2184. Let's compute:

1874 + 2000 = 3874; 3874 + 184 = 4058. 

Therefore, total sum is 4052 + 4052 + 4058 = 

First, 4052 + 4052 = 8104.

8104 + 4058 = 12162. 

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors is 12,162. 

Wait, but let me verify all numbers once again to make sure. 

2025, 2027, 2000, 2052, 1874, 2184. 

Yes. 

But let me check if there is an error in calculation for inward and outward numbers. 

For the inward number: 2026 - [6*25 + 2] = 2026 - 150 -2 = 2026 - 152.

Calculate 2026 - 152: 2026 - 100 = 1926; 1926 - 52 = 1874. Correct. 

Outward: 2026 + 6*26 + 2 = 2026 + 156 + 2 = 2026 + 158. 

Calculate 2026 + 158: 2026 + 100 = 2126; 2126 + 58 = 2184. Correct. 

Then the other numbers:

2000 and 2052 are straightforward. 

Previous: 2025 and next: 2027. 

So yes. 

Therefore, the sum is indeed 12162. 

But let me check once more with another approach. 

Alternatively, compute each number:

2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1874 + 2184 

Let me add them step by step:

Start with 2025 + 2027 = 4052

Then +2000 = 4052 + 2000 = 6052 

Then +2052 = 6052 + 2052 = 8104 

Then +1874 = 8104 + 1874 

Calculate 8104 + 1874:

8000 + 1800 = 9800 

104 + 74 = 178 

Total: 9800 + 178 = 9978? Wait no:

Wait 8104 + 1874:

Breakdown:

8104 + 1000 = 9104 

9104 + 800 = 9904 

9904 + 74 = 9978 

Then add 2184: 9978 + 2184 

Calculate 9978 + 2000 = 11,978 

11,978 + 184 = 12,162. 

Yes, same result. 

Therefore, the answer is 12,162. 

But let me check once again if the neighbors are correct. 

For example, take the inward neighbor 1874: is it adjacent to 2026? 

Since when moving inward from direction i=2, we subtract 152. Given that the formula was derived from previous examples and seems logical, it's likely correct. 

Similarly, the neighbor 2000 is on side i=1, same offset. Given that in the example with number 8, that formula gave us 6, which is correct, it's likely valid here. 

Therefore, unless I made a mistake in deriving the formulas, which I tried to verify with examples, the answer is 12162.

Thus, I think the sum of all six neighbors is 12,162.

**Final Answer**
The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is \boxed{12162}.
</think>

To determine the sum of all six neighbors of the number **2026** in a hexagonal spiral of natural numbers, we analyze the spiral's structure, which expands in **rings** around a central number.

### 🧮 Step 1: Determine the Ring Containing 2026

The total number of natural numbers up to ring $ n $ is given by:

$$
T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
$$

We want to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ T(n) \geq 2026 $.

Trying $ n = 26 $:

$$
T(25) = 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \\
T(26) = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
$$

So, **2026 lies in ring 26**, as $ T(25) < 2026 \leq T(26) $.

Its position **within ring 26** is:
$$
\text{pos\_in\_ring} = 2026 - 1951 = 75
$$

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Identify Side and Offset Within the Side

Each ring has 6 sides, each of length $ n $ (in this case, 26). Divide 75 into regions of 26 to find which side it is on:

$$
75 \div 26 = 2\ \text{remainder}\ 23 \Rightarrow \text{side 2 (0-indexed)},\ \text{offset} = 23
$$

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Determine the 6 Neighbors

From calculations and grid arithmetic (see derivation in the thought process), the six neighbors of **2026** are:

1. **2025** – Previous in the same side
2. **2027** – Next in the same side
3. **2000** – $ x - 26 $
4. **2052** – $ x + 26 $
5. **1874** – Inward from the spiral: $ x - (6 \cdot (n-1) + 2) = 2026 - 152 $
6. **2184** – Outward from the spiral: $ x + (6n + 2) = 2026 + 158 $

Verifying all values ensures correctness and completeness.

---

### ✏️ Step 4: Compute the Total

Add the six values:

$$
2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1874 + 2184 = 12162
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{12162}
