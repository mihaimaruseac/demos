Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral. Let me start by understanding how the numbers are arranged on this spiral. 

First, I know that on a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors. In a spiral, numbers are added in layers, kind of like concentric circles. In a square spiral, each layer adds an odd number squared, but in a hexagonal spiral, maybe it's different? Wait, let me think.

A hexagonal grid can be thought of as having concentric rings. The center is 1, then the next ring around it has 6 numbers, the next ring has 12 numbers? Wait, maybe each ring adds 6 more numbers than the previous one? Wait, no, in a hexagonal grid, each ring has 6n numbers where n is the ring number? Let me check:

For example, the first ring (just the center) is 1. Then the first ring around it (distance 1 from center) would have 6*1 numbers. The next ring (distance 2) would have 6*2 numbers, and so on. So total numbers up to ring n would be 1 + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2). Wait, but that's not necessarily how the spiral is laid out here. Maybe the numbers increase as we spiral outwards?

But let's try to figure out the positions. Let me try to sketch the initial numbers as given:

The problem gives:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So looking at the top row: ..., 14, 4, 3, 10 ...  
Middle row: .. 15, 5, 1, 2, 9 ...  
Bottom row: ... 16, 6, 7, 8 ...

Assuming the spiral continues outward. Let me visualize this. Maybe the center is 1, then moving in a spiral. Maybe each ring is completed by moving in a hexagonal pattern. 

In a hexagonal grid, movement can be considered in six directions. But for the spiral, I need to figure out the pattern of how numbers are assigned. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the layers. Let me think about how numbers are arranged. In square spirals, the layers are determined by the square numbers, but here in hexagonal, it's different.

In a hexagonal grid, each concentric layer (ring) around the center has a certain number of numbers. Let me recall that in a hexagonal lattice, each ring at distance k from the center has 6k numbers. For example:

- Layer 0 (center): 1 number (total: 1)
- Layer 1: 6*1 = 6 numbers (total: 1+6=7)
- Layer 2: 6*2=12 numbers (total: 7+12=19)
- Layer 3: 6*3=18 numbers (total: 19+18=37)
- Layer 4: 6*4=24 numbers (total: 37+24=61)
- And so on.

So the total number of numbers up to layer k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1). Let me verify with k=1: 1 + 3*1*2=1+6=7, correct. k=2: 1 + 3*2*3=1+18=19, correct.

So if we can figure out which layer 2026 is in, that might help us find its neighbors.

So first, find n such that 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026. Let me solve 3n(n+1) +1 ≥ 2026.

Subtract 1: 3n(n+1) ≥ 2025 => n(n+1) ≥ 675.

Find n so that n(n+1) ≈ 675.

Let me approximate n^2 ≈ 675 => n ≈ sqrt(675) ≈ 25.98.

Check n=25: 25*26=650 < 675

n=26: 26*27=702 ≥ 675. So n=26. Therefore, layer 26 has numbers from total up to layer 25, which is 1 + 3*25*26 = ?

Let me compute that. 3*25*26 = 3*650 = 1950. Total numbers up to layer 25: 1 + 1950 = 1951.

Therefore, layer 26 starts at number 1952, and has 6*26 = 156 numbers, so ends at 1951 + 156 = 2107.

So 2026 is in layer 26. Therefore, the distance from the center is 26. 

Now, to figure out neighbors, we need to know where 2026 is located in its layer, and then figure out the coordinates or relative positions of its neighbors. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the neighbors based on the layer and position in the layer.

First, let's figure out the starting number of the layer. Layer 26 starts at 1952 as mentioned. The last number of each "side" of the layer can be calculated. Since each layer has 6 sides, each side has 26 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, each layer has 6*(number of the layer). So layer 26 has 156 numbers. Divided by 6 sides, each side is 26 numbers.

Yes, since 6*26=156. So each side of layer 26 has 26 numbers.

So the numbers on each side can be thought of as:

Starting at the end of the previous layer: 1951, then the first side goes from 1952 to 1952 + 25 = 1977 (since 26 numbers per side). Then the next side from 1978 to 1978 +25=2003, then next to 2004 to 2004+25=2029, etc.

Wait, let me check. Let's think about how the numbers progress. In a spiral, each layer is constructed by moving in six directions. Let me think if the numbers progress in a way similar to square spiral, but in six directions.

But maybe there is a systematic way. Let me try to figure out the positions in the layer.

Let me note that each layer has six corners, which are significant numbers. For example, in square spirals, the corners are related to the squares of odd numbers. Here, perhaps each corner of the hexagonal layer is a number that can be calculated.

Alternatively, since each layer has 6n numbers for layer n (but n is 26 here). Wait, in our case, layer number is the distance from center, so let me adjust notation. Let me denote the layer number as k (distance from center). For k=0, it's just 1. For k=1, layer 1 has numbers from 2 to 7. Wait, but according to previous calculation, layer 1 starts at 2? Wait, total up to layer 0 is 1. Then layer 1 has 6 numbers: numbers 2 to 7. Then total up to layer 1 is 7. Then layer 2 starts at 8 and has 12 numbers up to 19, and so on. Wait, let me confirm with the numbers given in the problem.

Looking at the sample given:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

So the center is 1. Then moving clockwise? The next numbers would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, then next layer?

But maybe in the given sample, the numbers go from center outwards. The first layer (distance 1) is 2 through 7. Then layer 2 (distance 2) is 8 through 19, etc. Let's see:

In the sample, numbers go up to 16. Let's check if 16 is in layer 2. Total up to layer 1 is 7, then layer 2 has 12 numbers, from 8 to 19. So 16 is in layer 2, which is correct.

So for layer k, numbers are from 1 + 3k(k-1) + 1 to 1 + 3k(k+1). Wait, earlier we had total numbers up to layer k is 1 + 3k(k+1). Therefore, numbers in layer k are total numbers up to layer k minus total numbers up to layer k-1. Which is [1 + 3k(k+1)] - [1 + 3(k-1)k] = 3k(k+1) - 3k(k-1) = 3k [ (k+1) - (k-1) ] = 3k * 2 = 6k. Which matches the earlier statement that each layer has 6k numbers. Therefore, numbers in layer k start at Start(k) = 1 + 3k(k-1) + 1? Wait no:

Total numbers up to layer (k-1) is 1 + 3(k-1)k. Then layer k starts at that +1: Start(k) = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). Wait let me verify:

For k=1, Start(1)=2 + 3*1*(0) = 2 + 0 = 2, which is correct. For k=2, Start(2) = 2 + 3*2*(1) = 2 + 6=8. Which matches because layer 2 starts at 8. For k=3, Start(3)=2 + 3*3*2= 2 + 18=20. Total numbers up to layer 2 is 1 + 3*2*3= 1 + 18=19. So yes, layer 3 starts at 19 +1=20. Correct. Perfect.

Therefore, Start(k) = 1 + 3k(k - 1) + 1? Wait no, the formula was derived as Start(k) = total numbers up to k-1 + 1 = [1 + 3(k-1)k] +1 = 2 + 3k(k-1). Wait 1 + 3(k-1)k is total up to k-1, so adding 1 gives the next number. Therefore Start(k) = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). Wait but 3(k-1)k + 2.

Alternatively, maybe another way: Start(k) = 1 + 3k(k - 1) + 1? No, actually:

Total numbers up to layer (k-1) is 1 + 3*(k-1)*k. Therefore, the first number in layer k is that +1, which is 1 + 3*(k-1)*k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k - 1). Yes.

So for 2026, which is in layer k=26. Let's verify:

Start(26) = 2 + 3*26*(26 - 1) = 2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 3*650 = 2 + 1950 = 1952. Correct as before. And the last number in layer 26 is Start(26) + 6*26 -1 = 1952 + 156 -1 = 1952 + 155= 2107. Therefore, 2026 is somewhere in layer 26.

Now, to find its position in the layer. Let's compute how far it is from the start of the layer.

Number in layer: 2026 - Start(k) + 1? Wait no, position_in_layer = 2026 - Start(k) + ?

Wait, position_in_layer = 2026 - Start(k) + 1? Or not? Let me think. For example, if number is Start(k), then position is 1. So position_in_layer = 2026 - Start(26) + 1? Or just 2026 - Start(26). Let me check with Start(k)=1952, which is position 1. If I take 1952 - 1952 = 0, but if I want position from 1 to 6*26=156, so perhaps the position is 2026 - Start(k) + 1. Wait, for Start(k) + x -1 = number. Let me solve for x: number = Start(k) + x -1 => x = number - Start(k) +1. So x ranges from 1 to 6k. 

Yes. For example, Start(k)=1952, number=1952: x=1952-1952 +1=1. Number=1952+1=1953: x=1953 -1952 +1=2. Correct. So position_in_layer = number - Start(k) +1. 

So for 2026: position_in_layer = 2026 - 1952 +1= 74 +1=75. Wait 2026 -1952=74. So position is 75. So in layer 26, there are 6*26=156 numbers. So 75th position. 

Now, since each layer has 6 sides, each of length 26 numbers. Therefore, each side has 26 numbers, so position 1-26 on first side, 27-52 on second, 53-78 on third, 79-104 on fourth, 105-130 on fifth, 131-156 on sixth. 

Our position is 75, which is within the third side (positions 53-78). Specifically, 75 - 52 = 23. So it is the 23rd number on the third side. Wait:

First side: positions 1-26

Second: 27-52 (26 numbers)

Third: 53-78 (26 numbers). 

Yes, so 75 is 75-52=23rd in the third side. 

Now, the next step is to figure out what direction each side is, because neighbors depend on the position on the side. 

In a hexagonal spiral, the direction changes as you go around the hexagon. Let me think about how the spiral progresses. Starting from the center, moving right, then up-right, then up, then up-left, then left, then down-left, then down, then down-right? Or something like that. 

But since it's a spiral, each layer is added by going around in a loop. However, the exact path can vary depending on the direction chosen when constructing the spiral. But given the sample numbers, let's try to see.

The sample given has:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Looking at this, the numbers spiral clockwise. Starting from 1, going to 2, then 3, then 4, then 5, then 6... 

Wait, the top part shows ...14, 4, 3, 10... and the middle row has ...15, 5, 1, 2, 9... and the bottom one ...16,6,7,8...

So starting from 1 (center), moving to 2 (right), then up? Wait, 2 is to the right of 1? Then 3 is next? Let's try to reconstruct the spiral.

Let me draw mentally:

Center is 1.

Then moving to the right, which is 2. Then up and right? Then up? Then left? Maybe.

Looking at the numbers:

In the middle row: ...,15, 5, 1, 2, 9... So 1 is between 5 and 2. So 5 is to the left of 1, and 2 is to the right. Then above that, ...14,4,3,10... which is the row above. So above 1 is 4? Let me see:

In the row above the middle row: ... 14, 4, 3, 10 ... 

In the middle row: ...15, 5, 1, 2, 9...

So above the 1 is 4? So in the grid, it's like:

Row -2: ... 14, 4, 3, 10 ...

Row -1: ... 15, 5, 1, 2, 9 ...

Row 0: ... 16, 6, 7, 8 ...

Assuming the center is in row -1? Not sure. Maybe another way. Let's think of the center as position (0,0). Moving right to (1,0) is 2, moving to (1,-1)? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe coordinates can be defined for hex grids. 

In hex grids, there are different coordinate systems, but maybe axial coordinates or offset coordinates. Maybe it's easier to think that each layer has six directions, which can be labeled as directions 0-5. 

But perhaps instead of getting bogged down in coordinates, we can think about the neighbors of a number based on its position in the layer.

In general, for a hexagonal grid in a spiral, each number has neighbors that can be determined by their position on the spiral. However, the exact positions depend on the side of the layer and the position on the side. 

In the square spiral, corners have specific properties. Similarly, maybe here. Let me think about the corners of each layer. Each layer has 6 corners, which are the last numbers of each side. For example, in layer 1 (k=1), numbers 2 through 7. The corners would be 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3? Wait maybe not. Let me think again.

Actually, when you go around the hexagon, each side starts with a "corner" from the previous side. Maybe each side starts at a corner and ends at a corner. For example, in layer 1, starting at 2 (first corner), moving along first side to 7 (which is actually maybe not, because layer 1 has 6 numbers. Each side has 1 number (since k=1). So the numbers on each side are just 1 number? Wait k=1, each side has length k=1. Wait, earlier I said for layer k, each side has k numbers. Wait, but for k=1, each side has 1 number. So the 6 numbers of layer 1 are each on their own side. Therefore, the corners of layer 1 are numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

Similarly, for layer k, each side has k numbers, and the corners are the last number of each side. Therefore, for layer 26, each side has 26 numbers, and the corners are the last numbers of each side. 

Therefore, for layer k, the corners are Start(k) + 6*(m-1)*k + (k) for m from 1 to 6? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Since each side has k numbers. The first side starts at Start(k) and ends at Start(k) + k - 1. Then the second side starts at that +1 and ends at Start(k) + 2k -1, etc. Therefore, the corners of the layer are the last number of each side. Therefore, for layer k:

First corner: Start(k) + k - 1

Second corner: Start(k) + 2k -1

Third corner: Start(k) + 3k -1

Fourth corner: Start(k) + 4k -1

Fifth corner: Start(k) + 5k -1

Sixth corner: Start(k) + 6k -1

So for example, for layer 1 (k=1):

Start(k) = 2

First corner: 2 + 1 -1 = 2 (which is the only number in the first side), then second corner is 2 + 2 -1= 3, but this is actually the first number of the second side? Wait, no:

Wait, Start(k) for k=1 is 2.

First side: positions 1-1 (just 2). So end at 2. Then second side starts at 3, and ends at 3 (since k=1). Therefore the corners are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Which matches Start(k) + m*k -1, for m from 1 to 6. So for m=1 to 6:

First corner: m=1, 2 + 1*1 -1= 2

Second corner: m=2, 2 + 2*1 -1=3

Third corner: 2 + 3*1 -1=4

Fourth: 2 +4 -1=5? Wait 2 +4*1 -1=5? Wait for m=4, it's Start(k) + m*k -1? Wait no, it's Start(k) + m*(something)? Wait the formula was  Start(k) + m*k -1? Wait no, the first corner is Start(k) + k -1, second corner is Start(k) + 2*k -1? Because:

First side ends at Start(k) + k -1

Second side ends at Start(k) + k -1 + k = Start(k) + 2k -1 ?

Wait if first side is from Start(k) to Start(k) + k -1. Then second side starts at Start(k) +k and ends at Start(k) +k + (k-1) = Start(k) + 2k -1. Yes. Therefore, the m-th corner is Start(k) + m*k -1. Therefore yes. Therefore, for layer k, the corners are Start(k) + m*k -1, m from 1 to 6. Therefore, for layer 26:

Start(k)=1952. Corners:

First corner: 1952 +1*26 -1=1952+25=1977

Second corner: 1952 +2*26 -1=1952 +51= 2003

Third corner: 1952 +3*26 -1=1952+77=2029

Fourth corner: 1952 +4*26 -1=1952+103=2055

Fifth corner: 1952 +5*26 -1=1952+129=2081

Sixth corner: 1952 +6*26 -1=1952+155=2107 (which is also the last number in the layer, as calculated before)

Therefore, our target number 2026 is in layer 26, position_in_layer=75. Let's see which corner it is near. 

Third corner is 2029. So position_in_layer for third corner is:

Since Start(k)=1952, value=2029. Then position_in_layer is 2029 -1952 +1= 78. Therefore, the third corner is at position 78 in the layer. Since our number is at position 75, which is 3 positions before the third corner. So on the third side, which is from position 53 to 78. Our position is 75, 78-75=3, so it's 3 before the end of the third side. Therefore, it is located on the third side, 3 units away from the corner towards the beginning of the side.

This might help us determine its neighbors.

In general, in a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number depend on whether it's on a side or a corner, and where it is on the side. 

But how do we determine the neighbors? Let me think.

If I can figure out the coordinates of the number in the grid, then I can find the six neighbors. So maybe we need a coordinate system.

In axial coordinates for hex grids, there are three coordinates (q, r, s) with q + r + s = 0. Alternatively, offset coordinates. But maybe it's easier to use(cube coordinates) axial coordinates. However, without knowing the exact direction of the spiral, it's difficult. But maybe I can derive the coordinates based on layer and position.

Alternatively, since we know the position_in_layer=75, and we know it's on the third side of layer 26, maybe we can figure out the neighbors based on movement on the hex grid.

Each side of a layer has numbers moving in a particular direction. The key idea is that the neighbors will mostly be in the same layer (except for the neighbors along the direction towards the center). 

But since the number is not at a corner, it should have five neighbors in the same layer and one in the inner layer? Or maybe not. Wait, each number on a side between two corners will have neighbors on the same side and adjacent sides?

Alternatively, perhaps for a number on a side, moving along that side, the neighbors are adjacent numbers on the same side, numbers from the previous side, and numbers from the next side? 

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of directions. Let me try to think of each side as going in a particular direction.

Assume that the first side is going in direction A, the second in direction B, etc. Each direction is 60 degrees apart. 

But since the spiral is constructed by moving around the hexagon clockwise or counterclockwise, each side is a direction. 

In order to figure out the neighbors, perhaps there is a pattern. For example, numbers adjacent along a side are the previous and next number in the layer. Additionally, there are neighbors from adjacent sides, and one neighbor from the inner layer.

But let me think with the sample given. Let's take the number 2 in the sample. It's on the first side of layer 1. Its neighbors would be 1 (inner), 3 (next in side), and others? 

Looking at the sample, for number 2: neighbors are 1 (center), 3 (to the right?), 9 (probably), 4 (maybe), 5 (maybe), and something else. Wait the sample shows neighbors of 2 would be 1 (center), 3 (right?), and then the numbers above, below, etc. 

But the sample given shows:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Number 2 is at position (assuming the middle row is row 0): in row 0, column 3? Then its neighbors would be 1 (up-left?), 3 (right), 9 (up-right?), 5 (down-left?), 7 (down?), and 8 (down-right)? But the actual numbers around 2 would be:

Looking at the middle row: ...5, 1, 2, 9... and above that is ...4, 3, 10... and below that is ...6, 7, 8...

So neighbors of 2 are:

Left: 1 is left? No, in the middle row, to the left of 2 is 1, then to the right is 9. Above it is 3, below it is 7. Also, there are other neighbors? In a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors. So depending on orientation, maybe two from the row above and two from the row below.

But in the given diagram, the numbers adjacent to 2 would be:

- 1 (center)
- 3 (above-right)
- 9 (above-left? Or to the right?)
Wait this is getting confusing without a clear coordinate system.

Maybe another approach. Since we know that numbers on a hexagonal spiral have neighbors that can be determined by their position in the layer. For numbers not on a corner, two of their neighbors are adjacent numbers on the same side of the layer, two on adjacent sides, one from the next layer inwards, and one from the next layer outwards? Or something like that.

Alternatively, since the number is on the third side of layer 26, which is between the second and third corners (2003 and 2029). Since it is 3 before the corner, maybe we can figure out its position relative to those corners.

But perhaps there's a formula. I remember that in square spirals, the distance from a number to the center can help, but here we already know the layer is 26.

Alternatively, maybe think of the coordinates in terms of movement. In a hexagonal grid, each layer can be represented as moving in a certain direction. For example, starting from the center, layer k can be thought of as being at a distance k in one of the six directions. 

But perhaps we can think that each side corresponds to a movement in one of the six directions. If we can figure out which direction the third side corresponds to, then we can model the position of 2026.

Alternatively, here's another idea. In the hexagonal grid, moving from one number to another can be represented as vectors. Each layer side is a straight line of hexagons in a particular direction. 

If we can determine the offset from the corner, we can compute the neighbors.

Given that our number is 3 before the third corner on the third side. Let me denote that the third corner is at position 78, and our number is 75, which is 3 before that. Therefore, starting from the beginning of the third side (position 53 in the layer), moving 23 steps to reach 75 (since 75 - 53 +1 = 23rd number on the side). Wait, position_in_side = position_in_layer - (side - 1)*k. Since each side is length k=26. For the third side, it is (third side) so side=3. Therefore position_in_side = 75 - (3 - 1)*26 = 75 - 2*26 = 75 - 52=23. Therefore, it's the 23rd number on the third side.

Therefore, the distance from the start of the third side is 23, and the distance from the end of the side (the corner) is k - position_in_side +1 = 26 -23 +1=4? Wait, from position_in_side=23, to reach the end (position_in_side=26), you move 26 -23=3 steps. Therefore, it is 3 steps before the corner. 

Therefore, the number is located on the third side, 23 steps from the beginning and 3 steps from the end. 

Now, to figure out neighbors. Let's consider that on a side, moving away from the center, each number has:

- The previous number on the side (except the first one)
- The next number on the side (except the last one)
- Two numbers from the adjacent sides (the previous side and next side in the layer)
- One number from the inner layer
- Or maybe?

Alternatively, in the hexagonal grid, each side is adjacent to two other sides. For example, the third side is adjacent to the second and fourth sides. The neighbors of a number on the third side will include:

- The number before (if not first in the side)

- The number after (if not last in the side)

- A number from the previous side (side 2)

- A number from the next side (side 4)

- A number from the inner layer (layer 25)

- And one more? Wait, six neighbors. So maybe another neighbor. 

Wait maybe also a number from the outer layer? If the number is not at the end of the side. 

Wait, but in this case, the number is not at the corner, so maybe two from same side, one from previous side, one from next side, one from inner layer, one from outer layer?

But how?

Actually, in a hexagonal grid with concentric layers, each number has neighbors in adjacent layers. However, if the number is not on the edge of the layer.

Wait, for example, a number on the third side of layer k, not on the corner, will have:

- Two neighbors along the same side (previous and next number).

- One neighbor from the previous side (the end of the previous side? Or adjacent to it?)

- One neighbor from the next side (the start of the next side? Or adjacent to it?)

- One neighbor from the inner layer (towards the center)

- And one from...? Hmm.

Wait maybe the sixth neighbor is from the outer layer? But if you are on layer k, the outer layer would be k+1. Unless you are at the end of the side, which is adjacent to starting the next side of the same layer? Wait, no. The sides are all part of the same layer.

Wait perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me think of the sample number 2, on the first side of layer 1. Its neighbors should be 1 (center), 3 (on same side), and numbers from adjacent sides and other layers?

Looking at the sample grid, neighbors of 2 are: 

From the sample grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Number 2 is in the middle row. Its neighbors should be:

- 1 (center, directly opposite direction)

- 3 (to the immediate right along the side)

- 9 (probably the next corner, starting the next side)

- 5 (adjacent on the previous side?)

Wait, above 1 is 4 and 3. To the left of 2 is 1 and below is 7? Maybe.

Alternatively, maybe it's helpful to assign coordinates to numbers. Let's try.

Hex grids can be represented with axial coordinates. Let's suppose axial coordinates (q, r, s), with q + r + s = 0. The center is (0, 0, 0). 

Now, each layer k corresponds to all points with max(|q|, |r|, |s|) = k? Not sure. Another way, the distance from the center in axial coordinates is such that distance = (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2? Not sure. Alternatively, the distance from the center is the maximum of |q|, |r|, |s|. Maybe. 

Alternatively, in axial coordinates, moving in six directions from the center. 

But maybe easier to think of cube coordinates. In cube coordinates for hex grids, each hex is represented by (x, y, z) with x + y + z = 0. 

The distance from the origin is (|x| + |y| + |z|)/2. 

But regardless, to find the coordinates of 2026, we need to know how the spiral is constructed. 

Alternatively, since we know it's on the third side of layer 26, 23 steps from the beginning.

Assume that the first side (side 1) goes in the direction of (1, 0, -1), the second side (side 2) goes in some direction, etc. But this requires knowing the directions each side corresponds to.

Alternatively, since the first side starts at the end of the previous layer's sixth side. For example, layer 1, side 1 starts at 2, which is adjacent to the center. If the center is at (0,0,0), then moving in direction (k, 0, -k) for some k? 

Alternatively, consider that each side of the layer corresponds to a specific axial direction. 

But maybe there's another approach. 

In general, in a hexagonal spiral, each layer has numbers that can be connected to their axial coordinates. The key idea is that the numbers on the "arms" of the spiral can be described by formulas. 

However, without knowing the exact direction of each side, this is challenging. Maybe we can use relative positions.

Since the number is on the third side of the layer, which is adjacent to the second and fourth sides. Given that the third side is 3 steps before the corner, maybe we can find neighbors accordingly.

Let me consider that for a number on the m-th side, at position d steps from the beginning of the side (and k - d steps to the corner), its neighbors are:

- The previous number on the same side (if not at the start)

- The next number on the same side (if not at the end)

- A number from the previous side, which is d steps from the end of the previous side

Wait, if the sides are connected sequentially, then the end of the previous side is adjacent to the start of the next side.

For example, the end of side 1 is adjacent to the start of side 2, which is adjacent to the end of side 2, etc.

Therefore, for a number on side m, d steps from the beginning, its neighbor from the previous side would be... Hmm.

Let me think with an example. Suppose we have side 3, and a number d steps from the beginning. The previous side is side 2, and next is side 4. The number at the end of side 2 is the corner, which is adjacent to the start of side 3. Therefore, moving from side 2 to side 3, the corner is adjacent to the first number of side 3. Similarly, moving from side 3 to side 4, the corner is adjacent to the first number of side 4.

Therefore, for a number on side m, d steps from the beginning, its neighbor from side m-1 would be the number which is d steps from the end of side m-1. 

Because the end of side m-1 is adjacent to the start of side m. So moving d steps backwards along side m-1 from the end would give a neighbor of the d-th number from the beginning of side m.

Similarly, the neighbor from side m+1 would be the number which is d steps from the beginning of side m+1. 

Wait, no. Because the corner at the end of side m is adjacent to the start of side m+1. If you go d steps along side m, then the neighbor across the corner would be... 

This is getting complex. Maybe with an example.

Take the sample. Let's consider the third side of layer 1, if it existed. But layer 1 only has 6 sides each with 1 number. 

Alternatively, take a larger layer. Let's consider layer 2, numbers 8-19. 

Suppose we have a number on side 2, let's say position d from the beginning. 

But maybe this is too vague. Let me try to find a formula for neighbors based on position in layer.

Assuming that:

For a number in layer k, side m (from 1 to 6), position d from the beginning of the side (from 1 to k), the six neighbors are:

1. Inner neighbor: the number in layer k-1, which is at a position corresponding to moving in the opposite direction. 

2. Outer neighbor: if the number is not on the last position of the side, then there's an outer neighbor in layer k+1? Or not? Maybe not necessarily. 

Wait, in the hexagonal grid, each hex has neighbors in all directions. If the number is on layer k, it can have neighbors in layer k-1 (inner) and layer k+1 (outer), depending on position.

Alternatively, perhaps:

- Two neighbors on the same side: previous and next.

- One neighbor from the previous side (side m-1)

- One neighbor from the next side (side m+1)

- One neighbor from the inner layer (layer k-1)

But that's six neighbors.

Yes. So if that's the case, then:

For a number on side m, position d:

- Previous on side: same side, position d-1 (if d > 1)

- Next on side: same side, position d+1 (if d < k)

- Previous side neighbor: side m-1, position k - d + 1 ? Wait, need to think about how the neighbors are related.

Let me consider that when you go from side m-1 to side m, the last number of side m-1 is adjacent to the first number of side m. Similarly, the last number of side m is adjacent to the first of side m+1. 

Therefore, the neighbor from side m-1 for the first number of side m is the last number of side m-1.

So for a number at position d on side m, the neighbor from side m-1 is the (k - d + 1)th number from the end of side m-1? Or the (d)th number from the beginning of side m-1? No, wait.

Actually, since the end of side m-1 is adjacent to the beginning of side m. So the first number of side m is adjacent to the last number of side m-1. Similarly, the second number of side m is adjacent to the second-to-last number of side m-1, and so on. So the d-th number on side m is adjacent to the (k - d + 1)-th number on side m-1. Because if d=1, then it's adjacent to the last (k-th) number of side m-1. If d=2, it's adjacent to the (k - 1)-th number of side m-1, etc. Therefore, neighbor from previous side is at position (k - d + 1) on side m-1.

Similarly, the neighbor from the next side m+1 is the d-th number on side m+1, because when you reach the end of side m, it connects to the beginning of side m+1. So if we are at position d from the beginning of side m, then moving to side m+1 at position d.

But this is only if the number is not at the end of the side. If the number is at the end of side m (d = k), then it connects to the beginning of side m+1 (d=1).

Therefore, for a general position:

Neighbor from side m-1: if m > 1, then number on side m-1 at position (k - d + 1)

Neighbor from side m+1: if m < 6, then number on side m+1 at position d

Additionally, the inner neighbor: which would be the number in layer k-1 that is in the same "direction". Similarly, perhaps the outer neighbor if d is not at the end, but maybe not. Wait, the inner neighbor is likely related to the position shifted towards the center. For example, moving back one layer from the current position.

This is getting complicated, but let's try to formalize.

Assuming that for a number on side m, position d from the beginning in layer k, we have neighbors:

1. Previous on same side: number at position d-1 on side m (if d > 1)

2. Next on same side: number at position d+1 on side m (if d < k)

3. Previous side neighbor: number at position (k - d + 1) on side m-1 (if m > 1)

4. Next side neighbor: number at position d on side m+1 (if m < 6)

5. Inner neighbor: need to determine

6. Outer neighbor: need to determine

But what are the inner and outer neighbors? 

The inner neighbor would be the number in layer k-1 that is in the same general direction. For example, if you are on the first side of layer k, moving inwards one layer would be at the end of the sixth side of layer k-1. 

Wait, since layers are constructed in a spiral, the inner neighbor of a number on the first side of layer k would be the number at the previous corner of layer k-1. 

Alternatively, think of it as moving from a position on side m, d steps from the beginning towards the center. 

This might require knowing what the corresponding position in layer k-1 is. 

But maybe there's a formula here as well. For any number on side m, position d in layer k, the inner neighbor is the number on layer k-1, same side m, position d. But since layer k-1 has smaller sides. Wait no, layer k-1 has sides of length k-1. So if we were on side m, position d in layer k, then the inner neighbor would be on layer k-1, side m, position d if d ≤ k-1. But if d > k-1, then... It depends on how the sides scale. 

Alternatively, for any number on side m, position d in layer k, its inner neighbor is the number that was at the same position in layer k-1. For example, for the first number on side 1 of layer k, its inner neighbor is the first number on side 1 of layer k-1. But this assumes that the inner neighbor is directly inwards, which is plausible.

However, layer k-1 ends at Start(k) -1 = 1 + 3(k-1)(k-1 + 1) = 1 + 3(k-1)k, which was our total numbers up to layer k-1. Wait, no, earlier we had Start(k) = 2 + 3k(k - 1). For layer k, the previous layer is k-1, which ends at total numbers 1 + 3(k-1)k. Therefore, the inner neighbor of a number in layer k would be... ?

Alternatively, perhaps the inner neighbor is the number that is located at the same position as our number but moved inward by one layer. But how to calculate that?

Alternatively, if we think that each side of layer k starts where the previous layer ended. For example, the first side of layer k starts at Start(k), which is after the entire layer k-1. Therefore, the inner neighbor of the first number on side 1 of layer k would be the last corner of layer k-1. But this is getting too vague. 

Let me think of a concrete example. Take number 2, which is on side 1, position 1 of layer 1. Its inner neighbor is 1, the center. Similarly, number 3, which is corner of side 1 and start of side 2 in layer 1, has inner neighbor... let's see. If you move inward from number 3, which is on layer 1 (first layer), you would be at the center. But number 3's inner neighbor is still 1? Not sure. 

Alternatively, consider number 8, which is the first number of layer 2 (Start(2)=8). Its inner neighbor would be the number that is in the same direction but inward, which might be the corner of layer 1. The corners of layer 1 are numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7. Which one is in the same direction as side 1? The first corner of layer 1 is 2. Therefore, the inner neighbor of number 8 is 2. 

Similarly, number 9, which is second on side 1 of layer 2, its inner neighbor would be... the second number on side 1 of layer 1? But layer 1 side 1 only has 1 number (position 1). Therefore, maybe it's still 2? Or is there a different relationship?

This suggests that for numbers on side m, position d in layer k, their inner neighbor is the number on side m, position min(d, k-1) in layer k-1. 

But for d ≤ k-1: inner neighbor is the same side and position in layer k-1.

For d > k-1: inner neighbor is the corner of layer k-1 on side m.

Because when you're on layer k, side m, position d where d exceeds the length of the side in layer k-1 (which is k-1), then the inner neighbor is the corner.

For example, take layer k=2, side m=1, d=1: inner neighbor is side 1, d=1 in layer 1: which is 2. Correct.

If d=2 in layer 2, side 1: since k-1=1, and d=2 > 1, the inner neighbor is the corner of side 1 in layer 1: which is 2. Therefore, number 9 (second on side 1 of layer 2) has inner neighbor 2. 

Similarly, number 8 (first on side 1 of layer 2) has inner neighbor 2. Wait, but if we move from 8 inward, we should reach 2. In the sample, number 2 is adjacent to 8? In the sample given, number 9 is adjacent to 2. Hmm, but according to the diagram, number 9 is to the right of 2. But maybe 8 is adjacent to 2 in another direction. 

Looking at the sample:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Number 8 is at the bottom row, adjacent to 7. The other neighbors of 8 would be... maybe 9? Or other numbers. It's hard to tell from the fragment, but according to the earlier logic, number 8's inner neighbor is 2, which may or may not be the case. 

But accepting for a moment that there is a formula for inner neighbors, let's attempt to use it. 

Similarly, outer neighbor would be the number on layer k+1, same side m, position d. However, this only exists if d ≤ length of the side in layer k+1. Since layer k+1 has sides of length k+1, so if d ≤ k+1, then there is an outer neighbor. For numbers where d ≤ k (since we're on layer k), then d ≤ k+1. So yes, there's an outer neighbor. Therefore, for any number not on the last position of the side, the outer neighbor is on layer k+1, same side, same position. For the last position (d = k), the outer neighbor would be on layer k+1, same side, position k, but layer k+1's side has length k+1, so position k is valid.

But in our case, since we are on layer 26, our number's outer neighbor would be on layer 27. However, we don't need it here since the question is about the neighbors of 2026, which is on layer 26. However, the inner neighbor is needed.

Therefore, assuming we can calculate the inner neighbor, then we can find all six neighbors by following:

If the number is on side m, position d:

Neighbors:

1. Previous on same side (if d > 1): number at position d-1 on same side

2. Next on same side (if d < k): number at position d+1 on same side

3. Previous side neighbor: number at position (k - d + 1) on side m-1

4. Next side neighbor: number at position d on side m+1

5. Inner neighbor: if d ≤ k-1, number at same side, same position on layer k-1; else, number at same side's corner on layer k-1.

6. Outer neighbor: number at same side, same position on layer k+1 (but since we're only considering neighbors of 2026, perhaps this isn't needed unless the number is at the end of the side? Wait no, the outer neighbor is in an outer layer, which is different from the current layer's neighbors. So for the six neighbors of 2026, which are all on the same layer or the adjacent layers?

Actually, in the hexagonal grid, each hex has six neighbors, which can be on the same layer or adjacent layers. For example, a number on the side of a layer will have some neighbors on the same layer (along the side and adjacent sides), one neighbor moving inward to the previous layer, and possibly one neighbor moving outward to the next layer. However, if the number is on the corner or not?

But since we are to find the sum of all six neighbors of 2026, we need to find all six.

But how to compute them without knowing absolute positions?

Given that, maybe we can use the above framework to compute these six neighbors for our specific case.

Our number is in layer k=26, side m=3, position d=23. 

Let me note the parameters:

- k = 26

- m = 3

- d = 23

First, calculate neighbors on same side:

1. Previous on same side: d=23 > 1, so previous is 2026 - 1 = 2025? Wait no. Wait, the numbers are sequential in the side. Since it's on the third side, starting from Start(k) + 2*k = Start(k) + 2*26 = 1952 + 52 = 2004? Wait no. Wait the Start(k) is 1952. The first side is from 1952 to 1952 + 26 - 1 = 1977. Second side from 1978 to 1978 + 25 = 2003. Third side from 2004 to 2004 + 25 = 2029. 

Therefore, the third side (positions 53-78 in layer) corresponds to numbers 2004 to 2029. 

Since position_in_side = 23, the number is 2004 + 23 - 1 = 2004 + 22 = 2026. Correct. Therefore, previous number on same side is 2004 + 22 -1 = 2004 + 21 = 2025. Next number is 2026 + 1 = 2027. 

Therefore:

- Previous same side: 2025

- Next same side: 2027 (if d=23 < 26). Since 23 < 26, yes.

Second, neighbor from previous side (side m-1 = 2). 

This would be the number on side m-1 = 2, position (k - d +1) = 26 - 23 + 1 = 4. So position 4 on side 2. 

Side 2 of layer 26 is from 1978 to 2003. What is the number at position 4 on side 2? 

Since side 2 has 26 numbers, starting at 1978. Position 1: 1978, position 2: 1979, ..., position 4: 1978 + 3 = 1981. So the neighbor from previous side is 1981.

Third, neighbor from next side (side m+1 = 4). This would be position d=23 on side 4. 

Side 4 of layer 26 starts at Start(k) + 3*k = 1952 + 3*26 = 1952 + 78 = 2030. Wait, no:

Start(k) = 1952.

First corner of layer is 1977 (end of side 1).

Second corner is 2003 (end of side 2).

Third corner is 2029 (end of side 3).

Fourth corner is 2055 (end of side 4).

Therefore, side 4 of layer 26 starts at previous corner + 1 = 2030. Wait:

Wait side 4 starts after side 3 ends. Side 3 ends at 2029. Then side 4 starts at 2030 and has 26 numbers, ending at 2030 + 25 = 2055 (the fourth corner). Therefore, the number at position d=23 on side 4 is 2030 + 23 -1 = 2030 + 22 = 2052. Therefore, the neighbor from next side is 2052.

Fourth, inner neighbor. 

Since d=23 and k-1=25. Since d=23 ≤ 25, the inner neighbor is on layer k-1=25, same side m=3, position d=23. 

So need to calculate the number on layer 25, side 3, position 23. 

Let's compute that. 

First, find Start(k') where k'=25. Start(25) = 2 + 3*25*(25 - 1) = 2 + 3*25*24. Compute 3*25*24 = 3*600=1800. Start(25)=2+1800=1802. 

Layer 25 has 6*25=150 numbers.

Now, position_in_layer for the inner neighbor is the position on side 3, position 23. 

Side 3 of layer 25 starts at Start(25) + 2*k' = 1802 + 50 = 1852? Wait, no:

First, the start of side 1: Start(25)=1802 to corner1: 1802 + k' -1 = 1802 +24= 1826 (first corner)

Side 2: 1827 to 1827 +24=1851 (second corner)

Side 3: 1852 to 1852 +24=1876 (third corner)

Therefore, side 3 of layer 25 is numbers 1852 to 1876. Position d=23 on side 3 is 1852 +23 -1=1852+22=1874. 

Therefore, the inner neighbor is 1874.

Fifth and sixth? Wait we have already five neighbors:

- Previous same side: 2025

- Next same side: 2027

- Previous side neighbor: 1981

- Next side neighbor: 2052

- Inner neighbor: 1874

Wait that's five. What's the sixth?

Earlier I thought about outer neighbor. For numbers not at the end of the side, is there an outer neighbor? 

Wait, the six neighbors should be:

1. Previous on same side

2. Next on same side

3. Previous side neighbor

4. Next side neighbor

5. Inner neighbor

6. Outer neighbor? 

Yes, because six in total. So the sixth neighbor is an outer neighbor, which is on layer k+1 = layer 27. Wait, but what is the outer neighbor here?

For a number not on the end of the side, the outer neighbor would be the number in the next layer, same position. But how do we find it? 

In our case, since the number is not on the end of the side (d=23 < 26), the outer neighbor is on layer 27, side m=3, position d=23. Let's compute that number.

Start(k'=27) = 2 + 3*27*(27-1) = 2 + 3*27*26 = compute 3*27=81, 81*26=2106, so Start(27)=2 + 2106=2108. 

Layer 27 has 6*27=162 numbers.

Now, the side 3 of layer 27 starts after sides 1 and 2. Side 1 ends at Start(27) +27-1= 2108 +26=2134. Side 2 ends at 2134 +27=2161. Side 3 starts at 2162, and numbers are from 2162 to 2162 +26=2188 (third corner of layer 27). 

The outer neighbor is at position d=23 on side 3 of layer 27, which is 2162 +23 -1 = 2162 +22=2184. Therefore, the outer neighbor is 2184.

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (previous on same side)

2. 2027 (next on same side)

3. 1981 (previous side neighbor)

4. 2052 (next side neighbor)

5. 1874 (inner neighbor)

6. 2184 (outer neighbor)

Therefore, the sum is 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2052 + 1874 + 2184. Let me compute this.

First, add 2025 + 2027: since they are consecutive numbers, their sum is 4052.

Then, 1981 + 2052. Let's compute 1981 + 2052:

1981 + 2052 = 1981 + 2000 + 52 = 3981 + 52 = 4033.

Then, 1874 + 2184: 1874 + 2184. 

Let me compute 1874 + 2184:

1800 + 2100 = 3900

74 + 84 = 158

So total 3900 + 158 = 4058.

Then total sum is 4052 + 4033 + 4058.

Compute 4052 + 4033 first:

4052 + 4033 = 8085.

Then 8085 + 4058:

8000 + 4000 = 12000

85 + 58 = 143

Total sum: 12000 + 143 = 12143.

Wait, so the sum of all six neighbors is 12,143?

But let me verify my calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

First, the numbers:

2025, 2027, 1981, 2052, 1874, 2184.

Let me add them sequentially:

Start with 2025 + 2027 = 4052 (correct)

Add 1981: 4052 + 1981 = 6033

Add 2052: 6033 + 2052 = 8085 (correct)

Add 1874: 8085 + 1874 = 9959

Add 2184: 9959 + 2184. Let's compute 9959 + 2000 = 11959, plus 184 is 12143. Correct. 

Therefore, total sum is 12143.

But wait, let me think again: in the hexagonal grid, are all six neighbors correctly accounted for? For example, in the sample given, let's check for a known number.

Take number 2. What is the sum of its neighbors?

From the sample grid:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Number 2 is adjacent to:

1 (center), 3 (right), 9 (next side), 5 (previous side?), and others. 

According to our earlier method:

Number 2 is in layer 1, side 1, position d=1. 

Previous on same side: Doesn't exist (d=1)

Next on same side: d+1=2, but layer 1 side has only one number (2), so next doesn't exist.

Previous side neighbor: since m=1, previous side (m-1=0?) Doesn't exist. Wait, maybe our earlier method didn't consider m=1 and m=6. When m=1, previous side would be m=6. Similarly for m=6, next side is m=1. 

Ah! I forgot to consider that sides wrap around. So when m=1, previous side is m=6, and for m=6, next side is m=1. In our calculation for number 2026, since it was on side 3, the previous side was 2 and next was 4, which is fine. But for numbers on sides 1 or 6, their neighbors would wrap around to the other end.

However, for number 2 (m=1, d=1), the previous side is side 6, and position on previous side is k - d +1 = 1 -1 +1 = 1? Wait k=1, so k - d +1 = 1 -1 +1 = 1. Therefore, neighbor from previous side (side 6) is position 1 on side 6. 

For layer 1, side 6 is the last side, which has number 7. Therefore, neighbor from previous side is 7. Then, neighbor from next side (side 2) is position d=1 on side 2, which is 3.

Inner neighbor: since d=1, k-1=0, which is the center (1). Outer neighbor would be on layer 2, side 1, position 1 which is 8. 

Then the six neighbors of 2 would be:

Previous on same side: none

Next on same side: none

Previous side neighbor: 7

Next side neighbor: 3

Inner neighbor: 1

Outer neighbor: 8 

Plus two others? Wait no, our earlier logic said for numbers not on the edge of the side, you have previous and next, but if they are on the edge, maybe not. Wait for number 2, which is on the first position of the side (d=1), so no previous on same side, no next if side has length 1. Therefore, only the previous side neighbor, next side neighbor, inner neighbor, outer neighbor, and...?

But in reality, number 2 has six neighbors. According to the diagram, number 2's neighbors are 1, 3, 9, 4, and others. There should be six. 

Indeed, in the diagram:

- 1 (center)

- 3 (right)

- 9 (next side)

- 4 (up?)

- 15 (above?)

Wait the diagram is limited, but according to the given fragments:

Looking again:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

Number 2 is adjacent to:

- 1 (above-left?)

- 3 (right)

- 9 (above-right?)

- 5 (below-left?)

- 7 (below?)

But it's hard to be precise. If according to our method, the neighbors are 7, 3, 1, 8, and... Maybe the outer neighbor is 8, and other two?

This suggests that maybe there are other neighbors not accounted for by the previous logic. So perhaps there are two more neighbors from adjacent sides?

This discrepancy shows that my previous reasoning is incomplete. Maybe the six neighbors include more than just those five, implying that when on a corner, or when sides wrap around, there might be more connections. 

Given that, perhaps my calculation for the neighbors of 2026 is missing something? 

But given that for 2026, we have six neighbors according to the method (previous same, next same, previous side, next side, inner, outer), totaling six. 

However, in the case of number 2, since it's on the first position of the side, which only has one number, previous same and next same don't exist, and thus we would need to find two more neighbors. 

Therefore, perhaps my formula is missing two cases when the number is at the beginning or end of the side. 

In particular, when a number is at the beginning of the side (d=1), there is no previous on same side, but perhaps there is another neighbor from the next side? Or maybe the outer neighbor is different. Wait, according to the earlier logic, there is an outer neighbor on the next layer. But that would be one neighbor. To get six total, there must be two more.

This suggests that the method needs to be refined. Perhaps when a number is at the beginning or end of a side, additional neighbors are on adjacent sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the outer neighbor is not always present. 

Given the uncertainty here, maybe I should verify my calculation for 2026 using another method, or see if there's an alternative way to calculate neighbors based on the layer and position.

Another approach is to note that each number's neighbors can be calculated by their offsets in the hexagonal grid. In a hexagonal grid with axial coordinates, each hex has six neighbors corresponding to the six directions. If we can assign axial coordinates to the number 2026, we can find the neighbors by applying those direction offsets.

But to do that, I need to determine the axial coordinates of 2026. 

Given that the number is in layer k=26, position_in_side=23 on side 3, perhaps there's a way to translate that into axial coordinates.

Assume that axial coordinates (q, r) can be determined based on the layer and side. In axial coordinates, each layer corresponds to moving outward in one of the six directions. 

For example, each side of the layer can be associated with a particular axial direction. For example, side 1 is moving in the +q direction, side 2 is moving in some combination, etc. 

However, without knowing the exact direction of each side, it's difficult. However, there is a standard way to assign coordinates for hexagonal spirals.

Alternatively, here's a resource I remember: in a hexagonal grid, the numbers on the six arms of the spiral can be described by arithmetic sequences. Each corner of the layer is a hex number or some other figurate number. 

For example, the corners of layer k are given by 1 + 3*k*(k-1) + m*k, where m is from 1 to 6? Earlier we found that corners are Start(k) + m*k -1, with Start(k) = 2 + 3k(k-1). Therefore, corners are 2 + 3k(k-1) + m*k -1 = 1 + 3k(k-1) + m*k.

Let me compute this for k=1:

1 + 3*1*(1-1) + m*1 = 1 + 0 + m = m+1. For m from 1 to 6, we get 2 through 7, which matches the corners of layer 1. 

For k=2:

Start(2)= 2 + 3*2*(2 -1)=2+6=8

Corners are Start(k) + m*k -1 = 8 + m*2 -1 = 7 + 2m, for m=1 to 6: 9,11,13,15,17,19. Total numbers up to layer 2 is 1 + 3*2*(2+1)=1 + 18=19. Correct. 

So yes, the corners of layer k are 1 + 3k(k-1) + m*k for m=1 to 6. 

Therefore, each corner is of the form 1 + 3k(k-1) + m*k. 

Additionally, numbers along the sides can be described as these corner values minus some offset. 

Given that our number is on layer k=26, side m=3, position_in_side=23. 

The corner of side m=3 in layer k=26 is 1 + 3*26*(26-1) + 3*26 = 1 + 3*26*25 + 78 = 1 + 1950 + 78 = 2029. Which matches what we calculated earlier. 

Since our number is 23 steps before the corner on side m=3, the number is 2029 - 23 = 2006? Wait no, because the corner is at position d=k=26 on the side, so stepping back 3 steps from the corner would be d=26 - 3 =23. And the value decreases by 3? No, the numbers increase as we go along the side. Wait
