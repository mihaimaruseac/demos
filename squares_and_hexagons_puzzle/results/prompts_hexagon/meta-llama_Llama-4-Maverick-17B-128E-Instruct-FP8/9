## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the hexagonal grid
The given hexagonal grid is filled with natural numbers in a spiral pattern. To solve this, we first need to understand the pattern and how the numbers are distributed around any given number.

## Step 2: Identify the pattern and the neighbors of a number
Looking at the grid, the number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 15 (if we consider the pattern and fill in the missing numbers). For any number n, we need to identify its position in the spiral and the numbers surrounding it.

## Step 3: Analyze the given numbers and their positions
The numbers given are: ... 14 4 3 10 ..., .. 15 5 1 2 9 ..., ... 16 6 7 8 .... We can see that 1 is at the center. Let's analyze the pattern further to understand how numbers are arranged.

## Step 4: Determine the structure of the spiral
By examining the pattern closely, we can observe that the spiral starts from the center (1) and moves outward. The numbers are arranged such that each layer around the center contains 6 more numbers than the previous layer.

## Step 5: Understand the layers of the hexagonal grid
The first layer (center) contains 1 number. The second layer contains 6 numbers (2-7). The third layer contains 12 numbers (8-19), and so on. The nth layer contains 6n numbers.

## Step 6: Locate the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the layer where 2026 is located, we need to determine which layer it falls into. The total number of elements up to and including the nth layer is given by $1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$. We need to find n such that $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \geq 2026$.

## Step 7: Calculate the layer for 2026
Let's solve $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \geq 2026$. This simplifies to $3n^2 + 3n - 2025 \geq 0$. We can approximate n by solving $3n^2 + 3n - 2025 = 0$.

## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation for n
Using the quadratic formula, $n = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-2025)}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 24300}}{6} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6} = \frac{-3 \pm 155.94}{6}$. We consider the positive root, so $n = \frac{-3 + 155.94}{6} \approx \frac{152.94}{6} \approx 25.49$. Thus, $n = 26$ because we're looking for the smallest n where $3n^2 + 3n + 1$ exceeds 2026.

## Step 9: Verify that 2026 is in the 26th layer
For $n = 25$, $3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$. For $n = 26$, $3(26)^2 + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$. So, 2026 is indeed within the 26th layer because $1951 < 2026 \leq 2107$.

## Step 10: Identify the neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is in the 26th layer, we need to understand the pattern of numbers in this layer and identify its neighbors. The 26th layer starts at 1952 and ends at 2107.

## Step 11: Calculate the position of 2026 within its layer
2026 is the $2026 - 1951 = 75$th number in the 26th layer. The layer has 6 * 26 = 156 numbers.

## Step 12: Understand the neighbor pattern for a number in the 26th layer
For any number in the 26th layer, its neighbors can be in the same layer or in the adjacent layers (25th or 27th). The neighbors of a number are the numbers directly adjacent to it in the hexagonal grid.

## Step 13: Determine the neighbors of 2026
To find the neighbors, we need to understand that 2026 is the 75th number in the 26th layer. The first number in the 26th layer is 1952. The numbers in the layer are consecutive.

## Step 14: Calculate the neighbors based on the spiral pattern
The neighbors of a number in the hexagonal spiral can be determined by its position in the layer. For the 75th number, we need to consider the numbers around it.

## Step 15: Analyze the specific neighbors of 2026
2026 is the 75th number in the 26th layer. To find its neighbors, we should look at the numbers immediately before and after it in the spiral, as well as the numbers in the adjacent layers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12291}$
