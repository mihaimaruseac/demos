I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The rings contain:
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring k: 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
k² + k - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97)/2

Since k must be positive: k ≈ 25.485

So 2026 is in ring 26. Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So ring 26 contains numbers 1952 through 2107.
2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total. The spiral moves around the hexagon, with each side having 26 numbers.

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers are placed along the 6 sides of the hexagon. Each side of ring k has k numbers. The 75th position in ring 26 means we've completed 2 full sides (52 numbers) and are 23 numbers into the third side.

For a number in the middle of a side of the spiral, its 6 neighbors are:
- 2 neighbors on the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors on the inner ring (ring 25)
- 2 neighbors on the outer ring (ring 27)

The neighbors on the same ring are simply 2025 and 2027.

For the neighbors on adjacent rings, I need to understand the alignment. In a hexagonal spiral:
- A number at position p in ring k corresponds roughly to positions around p*(k-1)/k in ring k-1
- And positions around p*(k+1)/k in ring k+1

For 2026 at position 75 in ring 26:
- Inner ring (ring 25) position ≈ 75×25/26 ≈ 72.1
- So the inner neighbors are around position 72 and 73 in ring 25
- Ring 25 starts at 1952, so positions 72-73 are 2023 and 2024

- Outer ring (ring 27) position ≈ 75×27/26 ≈ 77.9
- So the outer neighbors are around position 77 and 78 in ring 27
- Ring 27 starts at 2108, so positions 77-78 are 2184 and 2185

Wait, let me reconsider the neighbor pattern more carefully. In a hexagonal spiral, when a number is not at a corner:
- It has neighbors at positions n-1 and n+1 in the same ring
- It has 2 neighbors in the inner ring 
- It has 2 neighbors in the outer ring

After careful consideration of the hexagonal spiral structure, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring (ring 25): 1949, 1950
- Outer ring (ring 27): 2103, 2104

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1949 + 1950 + 2103 + 2104 = 12158
