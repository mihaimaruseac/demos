I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The rings contain:
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring k: 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
k² + k - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97)/2

Since k must be positive: k ≈ 25.485

So 2026 is in ring 26. Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So ring 26 contains numbers 1952 through 2107.
2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring forms a hexagon. The numbers are placed consecutively along the perimeter. The ring can be divided into 6 sides, with 26 numbers per side in ring 26.

Position 75 in ring 26: 75 = 2·26 + 23, so it's on the 3rd side, position 23 along that side.

For a number in ring k at position along a side (not at a corner), its neighbors are:
- 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors in ring k-1 
- 2 neighbors in ring k+1

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring (26): 2025 and 2027
- Inner ring (25): Two specific numbers
- Outer ring (27): Two specific numbers

To find the inner ring neighbors, I need to map positions. In ring 25, the corresponding positions would be around the (75/156)·150 ≈ 72nd position in ring 25.

Actually, let me use a different approach. The hexagonal spiral follows a predictable pattern where:
- Each number not on a corner has exactly 6 neighbors
- The differences between a number and its neighbors follow a pattern based on the ring number

For a number n in ring k (where k is large enough), the approximate differences to neighbors are:
- ±1 (neighbors in same ring)
- Approximately ±(6k-6) and ±(6k-5) for inner ring neighbors  
- Approximately ±(6k+6) and ±(6k+7) for outer ring neighbors

For 2026 in ring 26:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring differences ≈ -(6·26-6) = -150 and -(6·26-5) = -149
  So inner neighbors ≈ 2026-150 = 1876 and 2026-149 = 1877
- Outer ring differences ≈ +(6·26+6) = 162 and +(6·26+7) = 163
  So outer neighbors ≈ 2026+162 = 2188 and 2026+163 = 2189

The sum of all neighbors:
2025 + 2027 + 1876 + 1877 + 2188 + 2189 = 12182
