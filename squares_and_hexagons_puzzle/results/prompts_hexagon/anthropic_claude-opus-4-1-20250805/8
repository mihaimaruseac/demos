I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- Layer 1 (ring 1): contains 6 numbers (2-7)
- Layer 2 (ring 2): contains 12 numbers (8-19)
- Layer 3 (ring 3): contains 18 numbers (20-37)
- Layer n contains 6n numbers

The total numbers up to and including layer n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
- 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
- 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
- 3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0
- n² + n - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97)/2

So n ≈ 25.485, meaning 2026 is in layer 26.

Let me verify:
- Through layer 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
- Through layer 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in layer 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that layer.

Layer 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total, ranging from position 1952 to 2107.

In a hexagonal spiral, each layer forms a hexagon. The numbers are placed sequentially around the hexagon. In layer 26, position 75 out of 156 means we're about 75/156 ≈ 0.48 of the way around the hexagon.

The hexagon has 6 sides, each with 26 numbers. Position 75 means:
- We've completed 2 full sides (2×26 = 52 numbers)
- We're at position 23 on the third side (75 - 52 = 23)

The six neighbors of a position in a hexagonal grid are:
1. The previous number in the spiral (2025)
2. The next number in the spiral (2027)
3-6. Four numbers from adjacent layers

For a number in layer n at a non-corner position, the neighbors from adjacent layers are:
- Two from layer n-1 (inner layer)
- Two from layer n+1 (outer layer)

Since 2026 is at position 75 in layer 26:
- It has neighbors 2025 and 2027 in the same layer
- From layer 25: The corresponding positions would be around position 72-73 in layer 25
  - Layer 25 starts at 1877 and has 150 numbers
  - Position 72-73 in layer 25 would be numbers 1948-1949
- From layer 27: The corresponding positions would be around position 77-78 in layer 27
  - Layer 27 starts at 2108 and has 162 numbers
  - Position 77-78 in layer 27 would be numbers 2184-2185

However, I need to be more precise about the exact neighbor positions. In a hexagonal spiral:
- Each side of layer n has n numbers
- The corners are shared between adjacent sides

For position 75 in layer 26 (position 23 on side 3):
- Same layer: 2025, 2027
- Inner layer (25): positions approximately 70 and 71 → 1946 and 1947
- Outer layer (27): positions approximately 79 and 80 → 2186 and 2187

Let me recalculate more carefully. The actual neighbor pattern depends on the precise position. Given that 2026 is not at a corner:
- Neighbors in same ring: 2025, 2027
- Neighbors in inner ring (layer 25): 1947, 1948
- Neighbors in outer ring (layer 27): 2186, 2187

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1947 + 1948 + 2186 + 2187 = 12320
