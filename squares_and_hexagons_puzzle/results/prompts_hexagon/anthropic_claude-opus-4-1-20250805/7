I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the numbers spiral outward. In a hexagonal spiral:
- The center (1) is at ring 0
- Ring 1 contains 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2 contains 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring k contains 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

To find which ring contains 2026, I need to solve:
3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0
k² + k - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97)/2

So k ≈ 25.485, meaning 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers. The 75th position is roughly halfway around the ring.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring forms a hexagon. The neighbors of a number in ring k are:
- 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors in ring k-1 (inner ring)
- 2 neighbors in ring k+1 (outer ring)

For 2026 (position 75 in ring 26):
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027
- Inner ring (ring 25): I need to find which numbers in ring 25 are adjacent
- Outer ring (ring 27): I need to find which numbers in ring 27 are adjacent

The structure of the hexagonal spiral means that:
- Ring 25 starts at 1952 and ends at 1951 + 150 = 2101
- Ring 27 starts at 2108 and ends at 2107 + 162 = 2269

In hexagonal coordinates, the position mapping follows a pattern where:
- Each side of ring k has k numbers
- The corners are at positions k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k in the ring

Position 75 in ring 26 means we're at 75/156 ≈ 0.481 through the ring.
This puts us on the 3rd side (since 75 = 2×26 + 23).

For the inner neighbors: The hexagonal spiral has a regular pattern where position p in ring k corresponds to approximately positions (p×(k-1)/k) in ring k-1. For position 75 in ring 26, this maps to positions around 75×25/26 ≈ 72 in ring 25.

The two inner neighbors would be at positions 72 and 73 in ring 25:
- Position 72 in ring 25: 1951 + 72 = 2023
- Position 73 in ring 25: 1951 + 73 = 2024

For the outer neighbors: Position p in ring k corresponds to positions around p×(k+1)/k in ring k+1. For position 75 in ring 26, this maps to position 75×27/26 ≈ 78 in ring 27.

The two outer neighbors would be at positions 77 and 78 in ring 27:
- Position 77 in ring 27: 2107 + 77 = 2184
- Position 78 in ring 27: 2107 + 78 = 2185

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027 (same ring)
2023, 2024 (inner ring)
2184, 2185 (outer ring)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2184 + 2185 = 12468
