I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the numbers spiral outward. In a hexagonal spiral:
- The center is 1
- The first ring contains 6 numbers (2-7)
- The second ring contains 12 numbers (8-19)
- The third ring contains 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring k contains 6k numbers

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring k ends at 1 + 3k(k+1)
- We need 1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
- 3k(k+1) ≥ 2025
- k(k+1) ≥ 675

Testing values:
- k = 25: 25 × 26 = 650 (too small)
- k = 26: 26 × 27 = 702 (works!)

So 2026 is in ring 26.
- Ring 25 ends at 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
- Ring 26 starts at 1952 and ends at 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

Position of 2026 in ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring forms a hexagon. The numbers are placed sequentially around the perimeter. For ring 26:
- It has 156 positions
- Each of the 6 sides has 26 positions
- 2026 is at position 75 within this ring

Position 75 = 2 × 26 + 23, so it's on the 3rd side of the hexagon, position 23 of 26 on that side.

Now for the neighbors of 2026:
1. Two neighbors are consecutive numbers in the same ring: 2025 and 2027
2. Two neighbors are in ring 25 (inner ring)
3. Two neighbors are in ring 27 (outer ring)

For a number at position p in ring k:
- Inner neighbors: These follow a specific pattern based on the position within the ring
- Outer neighbors: Similarly follow a pattern

Given that 2026 is at position 75 in ring 26:
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027 (positions 74 and 76)

For the inner ring (ring 25) neighbors:
Ring 25 has 150 numbers (1802-1951)
The corresponding positions in ring 25 for position 75 in ring 26 would be around position 72-73 in ring 25.
Position 72 in ring 25: 1802 + 71 = 1873
Position 73 in ring 25: 1802 + 72 = 1874

For the outer ring (ring 27) neighbors:
Ring 27 has 162 numbers (2108-2269)
The corresponding positions would be around position 77-78 in ring 27.
But wait, ring 27 starts at 2108, not right after 2107.

Actually, let me recalculate more carefully. In a hexagonal spiral, the relationship between positions in adjacent rings follows a specific pattern.

For position 75 in ring 26 (which is 2026):
- In ring 25: positions would be approximately 72 and 73 → numbers 1873 and 1874
- In ring 26: positions 74 and 76 → numbers 2025 and 2027  
- In ring 27: positions would be approximately 77 and 78 → numbers 2108 + 76 = 2184 and 2185

Sum = 1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168
