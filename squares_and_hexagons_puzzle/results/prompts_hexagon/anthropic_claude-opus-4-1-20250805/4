I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center, the numbers spiral outward in hexagonal layers.

The layers contain:
- Layer 0 (center): 1 number (just 1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Layer k: 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including layer k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

To find which layer contains 2026, I need:
3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k ≥ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6

√24309 ≈ 155.98
k ≥ (-3 + 155.98)/6 ≈ 25.5

So 2026 is in layer 26.

Through layer 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Through layer 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in layer 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that layer.

Layer 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers (positions 1952 through 2107).

In a hexagonal spiral, each layer forms a hexagon. The 156 numbers in layer 26 are arranged along the hexagonal perimeter with 26 numbers on each of the 6 sides.

The 75th position in layer 26:
75 = 2·26 + 23, so it's on the third side of the hexagon, position 23 along that side.

Now I need to identify the neighbors. A number in the middle of a layer side has:
- 2 neighbors in the same layer (one before, one after in the spiral)
- 2 neighbors in the inner layer (layer 25)
- 2 neighbors in the outer layer (layer 27)

In layer 26:
- Previous number: 2025
- Next number: 2027

For the inner and outer layer neighbors, I need to track the correspondence. 

In layer 25, there are 6·25 = 150 numbers (positions 1802-1951).
The position corresponding to being "under" 2026 would be approximately at the same angular position.

Since 2026 is at position 75 in layer 26 (out of 156), its angular fraction is 75/156.
In layer 25 (150 numbers), the corresponding position would be around 75/156 × 150 ≈ 72.1

So the inner neighbors are around positions 72 and 73 in layer 25:
- Position 72 in layer 25: 1802 + 71 = 1873
- Position 73 in layer 25: 1802 + 72 = 1874

In layer 27, there are 6·27 = 162 numbers starting at position 2108.
The corresponding position would be 75/156 × 162 ≈ 77.9

So the outer neighbors are around positions 78 and 79 in layer 27:
- Position 78 in layer 27: 2108 + 77 = 2185
- Position 79 in layer 27: 2108 + 78 = 2186

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same layer: 2025, 2027
- Inner layer: 1873, 1874
- Outer layer: 2185, 2186

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2185 + 2186 = 12170
