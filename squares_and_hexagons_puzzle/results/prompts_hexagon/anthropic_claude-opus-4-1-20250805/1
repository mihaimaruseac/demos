I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the numbers spiral outward. In a hexagonal spiral:
- The center (1) is at ring 0
- Ring 1 contains 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2 contains 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring n contains 6n numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring n contains numbers from [1 + 3n(n-1) + 1] to [1 + 3n(n+1)]
- So ring n contains numbers from [3n² - 3n + 2] to [3n² + 3n + 1]

I need 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026:
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
n = (-3 ± √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 ± √24309)/6 = (-3 ± 155.98...)/6

Taking the positive root: n ≈ 25.5

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 26 starts at 3(26)² - 3(26) + 2 = 3(676) - 78 + 2 = 2028 - 78 + 2 = 1952
Ring 26 ends at 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

Position of 2026 within ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75
(Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total)

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring forms a hexagon. The 156 numbers in ring 26 are arranged around the hexagon, with 26 numbers on each of the 6 sides.

Position 75 in the ring: 75 = 2×26 + 23, so it's on the third side, position 23 of 26.

Now I need to identify the neighbors. A number in ring n has neighbors:
- 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors in ring n-1 (inner ring)
- 2 neighbors in ring n+1 (outer ring)

The neighbors of 2026 are:
1. In ring 26: 2025 and 2027 (adjacent in the spiral)
2. In ring 25: Two numbers that are radially adjacent
3. In ring 27: Two numbers that are radially adjacent

For the inner ring (ring 25):
Ring 25 has 150 numbers (from 1802 to 1951)
The corresponding position in ring 25 would be around position 72-73 in that ring.
Numbers: approximately 1802 + 72 = 1874 and 1802 + 73 = 1875

For the outer ring (ring 27):
Ring 27 has 162 numbers (from 2108 to 2269)
The corresponding positions would map to approximately positions 77-78 in ring 27.
Numbers: approximately 2108 + 77 = 2185 and 2108 + 78 = 2186

Actually, let me recalculate more carefully using the exact hexagonal structure.

In a hexagonal spiral, position 75 in ring 26 (which has 156 positions) corresponds to:
- Same ring: 2025 (position 74) and 2027 (position 76)
- Inner ring 25 (150 positions): positions roughly 72 and 73 → 1873 and 1874
- Outer ring 27 (162 positions): positions roughly 78 and 79 → 2185 and 2186

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2185 + 2186 = 12170
