I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20, 21, ..., 37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 6n numbers (except ring 0 which has 1)

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
- 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026.
Setting 3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026:
3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
n² + n - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
n = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97...)/2

So n ≈ 25.49, meaning 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So ring 26 contains numbers 1952 through 2107.
2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total.

Now I need to understand the structure of neighbors in a hexagonal spiral. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. The key insight is that most numbers in ring n have:
- 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors in ring n-1 (inner ring)
- 2 neighbors in ring n+1 (outer ring)

The exceptions are at the corners of the hexagon where the pattern shifts.

Since ring 26 has 156 numbers, and they form a hexagon, there are 26 numbers on each of the 6 sides. The 75th number is approximately halfway around the ring (75/156 ≈ 0.48).

Let me be more precise about the position. In ring 26:
- Each side has 26 numbers
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So 2026 (position 75 in the ring) is on the 3rd side, position 75-52 = 23 within that side.

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- In ring 26: 2025 and 2027 (previous and next)
- In ring 25: I need to find which two numbers from ring 25 are adjacent
- In ring 27: I need to find which two numbers from ring 27 are adjacent

For the inner ring (ring 25), it has 6×25 = 150 numbers. The corresponding position would be approximately (75/156)×150 = 72.1, so around positions 72 and 73 in ring 25, which are numbers 1951 + 72 = 2023 and 1951 + 73 = 2024.

Wait, let me reconsider. Actually 2023 and 2024 being neighbors makes sense since they're consecutive and close to 2026.

For the outer ring (ring 27), it starts at 2108 and has 6×27 = 162 numbers. The corresponding position would be approximately (75/156)×162 = 78, so around positions 78 and 79 in ring 27, which are numbers 2107 + 78 = 2185 and 2107 + 79 = 2186.

Therefore, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025, 2027 (same ring)
- 2023, 2024 (inner ring) 
- 2185, 2186 (outer ring)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2185 + 2186 = 12470
