I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- First ring: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Second ring: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
- Third ring would have 18 numbers, and so on

Each ring k (where k ≥ 1) contains 6k numbers.

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
- Center: 1
- Ring 1: 6
- Ring 2: 12
- Ring k: 6k

Total = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- 3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
- 3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
- k² + k - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97...)/2

Since k must be positive: k ≈ 25.48...

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers in each ring are placed consecutively along the perimeter. The ring starts at a specific position and moves around.

For the hexagonal grid, the 6 neighbors of any position are:
1. One position earlier in the spiral
2. One position later in the spiral  
3. Four positions connecting to adjacent rings (2 from inner ring 25, 2 from outer ring 27)

Since 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26:
- Previous in spiral: 2025
- Next in spiral: 2027

For the connections to adjacent rings, I need to understand the geometric structure. In ring k, position p connects to approximately:
- Inner ring (k-1): positions near p·(k-1)/k
- Outer ring (k+1): positions near p·(k+1)/k

For ring 26, position 75:
- Connection to ring 25: The 75th position in ring 26 corresponds roughly to position 75·(25/26) ≈ 72.1 in ring 25
- Ring 25 has 150 numbers (1952 through 2101 would be the range, but actually 1952 through 1951+150=2101... wait, let me recalculate)

Ring 25: numbers 1952 through 1951
Actually, let me be more precise about the numbering:
- Through ring 24: 3(24)² + 3(24) + 1 = 1728 + 72 + 1 = 1801
- Ring 25 contains numbers 1802 through 1951 (150 numbers)
- Ring 26 contains numbers 1952 through 2107 (156 numbers)
- Ring 27 will contain numbers 2108 through 2269 (162 numbers)

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

The geometric relationship for neighbors across rings follows a pattern where position p in ring k connects to:
- Positions near (p-1)·(k-1)/k and p·(k-1)/k in ring k-1
- Positions near p·(k+1)/k and (p+1)·(k+1)/k in ring k+1

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Inner ring 25: positions near 72.1 and 73.1, so likely 1873 and 1874
- Outer ring 27: positions near 77.9 and 78.9, so likely 2185 and 2186

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous in ring)
- 2027 (next in ring)
- 1873, 1874 (connections to ring 25)
- 2185, 2186 (connections to ring 27)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2185 + 2186 = 12170
