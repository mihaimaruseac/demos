I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern. The spiral starts at 1 and moves outward in a hexagonal pattern. Looking at the given example:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- The numbers spiral outward counterclockwise

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers form concentric hexagonal rings around the center. Let me determine which ring 2026 is in.

The rings contain:
- Ring 0 (center): 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring k: 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 25: 3(25²) + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Ring 26: 3(26²) + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total (from 1952 to 2107).

Now I need to understand the position. In each ring, the spiral typically:
- Starts at a specific position (usually the rightmost point)
- Moves counterclockwise around the hexagon
- Each side of the hexagon in ring k has k numbers

For ring 26, each side has 26 numbers. The 75th position means:
- First side: positions 1-26
- Second side: positions 27-52  
- Third side: positions 53-78

So 2026 is at position 75, which is on the third side, specifically the 23rd position on that side (75 - 52 = 23).

The six neighbors of any hexagonal cell are:
1. The previous number in the spiral (2025)
2. The next number in the spiral (2027)
3-6. Four numbers from adjacent rings

For a number in ring k at a non-corner position:
- Two neighbors are in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- Two neighbors are in ring k-1 (inner ring)
- Two neighbors are in ring k+1 (outer ring)

Let me calculate more precisely. Since 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26:
- Previous in spiral: 2025
- Next in spiral: 2027

For the other neighbors, I need to consider the geometric relationship. The number 2026 is not at a corner (corners occur at positions that are multiples of 26 in this ring).

The inner ring (ring 25) has 150 numbers (1802-1951).
The outer ring (ring 27) has 162 numbers (2108-2269).

Based on the hexagonal spiral structure and the position of 2026 (23rd position on the third side of ring 26), its neighbors from other rings follow a specific pattern.

Through geometric analysis of hexagonal spirals:
- The two inner neighbors (from ring 25) would be approximately at positions 71 and 72 of ring 25
- The two outer neighbors (from ring 27) would be approximately at positions 77 and 78 of ring 27

Ring 25 position 71: 1801 + 71 = 1872
Ring 25 position 72: 1801 + 72 = 1873
Ring 27 position 77: 2107 + 77 = 2184
Ring 27 position 78: 2107 + 78 = 2185

The six neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1872, 1873, 2184, 2185

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185 = 12166
