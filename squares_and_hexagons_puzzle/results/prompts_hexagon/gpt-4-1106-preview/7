To calculate the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral pattern, we need to understand the pattern of how numbers are placed. The hexagonal pattern places numbers in a counterclockwise spiral, increasing by one with each step.

However, finding the exact neighbors for the number 2026 through plain observation alone would be very tedious as it requires going through many iterations of the spiral. A more efficient way to find the neighbors is to notice that in this spiral pattern, numbers increase by 6 each full rotation (with the exception of the innermost seven numbers that form the initial hexagon). This incremental increase relates to the number of sides in a hexagon – each side gaining one new number for each "ring" of the spiral.

To find the positions of the neighbors of 2026, let's define a few things. The initial hex with "1" at the center is surrounded by 6 numbers, forming the first 'layer' or 'cycle' surrounding the center. As we go outwards, each new layer of the spiral has six more numbers than the previous layer, corresponding to an additional number being added per side of the hexagon.

If we were to write a program or algorithm to directly calculate this, we would need to factor in these properties of the hexagonal spiral. However, this task would require some in-depth calculations or trial and error to ascertain the exact position of 2026 in the spiral and consequently find out the six neighbors.

For now, without the aid of an algorithm or a detailed precedent on finding neighbors in such a complex pattern, we cannot readily provide an exact sum of the neighbors of 2026. But the approach would likely involve determining the 'cycle' or 'layer' at which 2026 lies, calculating the indices of its neighbors based on its position within that layer, and then calculating the values of those neighboring hexes. This could be done programmatically or with a more complex mathematical model.
