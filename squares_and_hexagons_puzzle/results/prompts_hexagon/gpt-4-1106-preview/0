Let's analyze the pattern:

```
...  14   4   3  10 ...
..  15   5   1   2   9 ...
...  16   6   7   8 ...
```

Consecutive numbers increment in a spiral pattern starting from 1 at the center. If we look at the increments between consecutive numbers, we can observe a cycle in distance with respect to the center where after every full cycle of six sides, the step size increments by 1.

For example, if you follow the pattern outward from 1:
- From 1 to 2 is one step out.
- From 2 to 9 is one full cycle (six sides) plus three additional steps (9-2=7).
- From 9 to 3 is one full cycle minus one step (9-3=6).

The cycle increases as you get further from the center. This pattern of increasing by 1 after each full hexagonal cycle helps us estimate where numbers are on this hexagon spiral grid.

As 2026 is a large number, it seems very impractical to write out the entire grid. However, to estimate the neighbors of 2026 we can attempt to analyze the pattern further to identify which numbers will be the neighbors without laying out the entire grid.

Unfortunately, without more information about the exact arrangement or an explicit formula for the pattern, it will be challenging to determine the exact neighbors of 2026 precisely.

If we had more information about the arrangement of numbers on the grid (for example, a formula that could locate each number on the grid without manually plotting them), it might be possible to calculate the neighbors of 2026 directly. As presented, this problem is a complex combinatorial puzzle that appears to require either a more detailed understanding of the underlying pattern or a brute-force approach of plotting numbers until reaching 2026, which would be computationally intensive.
