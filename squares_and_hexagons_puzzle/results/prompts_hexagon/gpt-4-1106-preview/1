To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid, we can make some observations about how the numbers are laid out around any given number.

The hexagonal spiral has a particular structure. For any number \(n\) (in this case 2026), the numbers that surround it will have differences that are somewhat consistent based on the 'layer' of the spiral that \(n\) is on.

The difference between consecutive numbers in the spiral increases by 6 with each full revolution since each new layer of the hexagon adds one more hexagon to each side.

To calculate the neighbors of 2026, let's try to understand the pattern:

1. The first number with a hexagonal ring of 6 around it is 1. 
2. The next number that starts a new layer is 7 (the previous layer has 6 numbers).
3. Every time a full hexagonal layer is completed, we add an additional 6 numbers to the total count needed to encircle the next layer. For instance, the second layer is completed with 7 + 12 = 19, and the next layer begins with 20. The third layer completes with 19 + 18 = 37, and the next starts with 38, and so on.
   
Given this structure, we can find the layer in which 2026 is located by:

1. Calculating the total number of boundary numbers for each layer until the count surpasses 2026.
2. Once the layer is known, we can derive the positions of the neighboring numbers relative to 2026.
   
However, without a simple formula for the above process and given the complexity of calculating these by pure arithmetic, we are presented with a challenge. This puzzle seems to require a computational approach or an insight into a mathematical formula that governs these positions, which isn't immediately apparent from the information given.

The task is computationally intensive and would require programming knowledge to construct the spiral and determine the neighbors efficiently. If this is an exercise or a puzzle where a non-computational approach is expected, there should be additional context or rules provided that allow one to deduce the position of 2026 and its neighbors based on some pattern or formula, which isn't evident from the information given here.

Therefore, without additional context or an algorithmic calculation, I'm unable to provide the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal spiral grid. If you have additional rules or context that might simplify this task, please provide them, and I will assist further.
