To find the neighbors of a specific number on a hexagonal spiral grid, it's useful to identify a pattern for how the numbers are laid out. Analyzing the given portion of the pattern, we notice that the numbers increase as we spiral out from the center:

```
   ... 14  4  3 10 ...
   .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
   ... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

In a hexagonal grid, each number (starting with the "2" which has "1" as the center) is surrounded by six neighbors, apart from the first number (1). If we recently passed a corner with the numbers 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, we could then try to calculate the sequence of increments between these numbers and 2026, which will help us to identify the six surrounding numbers.

In a hexagonal spiral pattern, each full loop around the center hexagon (starting from 2) adds an additional layer of hexagons. With each additional layer, the numbers increase. The corners, where the direction changes, occur after a sequence of numbers whose length corresponds to the number of the loop iteration (in units of hexagons), starting from the hexagon which includes "1".

Unfortunately, without an explicit formula or more context to determine the exact position of the number 2026 within the hexagonal grid, we cannot accurately determine its neighbors.

The problem of finding the neighbors of a given number in the hexagonal spiral grid pattern involves observing the number sequence and mathematically analyzing the growth pattern of the hexagon layers. This is a non-trivial problem and would typically require a more elaborate algorithmic approach to solve efficiently, especially since we are dealing with a relatively high number (2026), and we need to identify the particular loop and position of that number.

However, a computer algorithm could calculate this by simulating the pattern's growth until it reaches the given number, keeping track of the indices or coordinates of adjacent cells. After simulating the spiral and populating it with numbers up to 2026, the program could then quite easily identify the neighbors and calculate their sum. This computational method would be the most feasible approach for solving this problem without a known closed-form formula.
