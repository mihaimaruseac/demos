To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal grid spiral like the one described, we'll have to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify the values of its neighbors. However, since you've provided a pattern, we can rely on the pattern's properties rather than trying to actually draw or calculate the entire spiral up to 2026.

In a hexagonal spiral, each loop around the center hexagon increases in size. The center is 1, and each "shell" or "ring" has 6 more numbers than the previous one because every side of the hexagon increases by one unit in the spiral.

To visualize a bit before we hit larger numbers:

```
       19
   18      14
17      5       4
   16      1       3
       15      2       10
           6       7       9
               8
```

From here, we can deduce a few patterns:

1. The bottom-right number in each ring is a perfect square: 1, 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2),...
2. The bottom-right number in each ring increases by an odd number which increments by 2 for each new layer: 1 to 4 (+3), 4 to 9 (+5), 9 to 16 (+7), etc.
3. Each side of a hexagon (except the first) has the same number of numbers as its distance (in rings) from the center. For example, the third ring has hexagon sides containing 3 numbers each (apart from the central 1).

To locate the number 2026, we need to estimate which ring it would fall into. Given the rate of increase, it's better to use the squares as our guide since these grow by the square of an integer, and we know that 2026 is going to be closer to a square.

The nearest perfect square less than or equal to 2026 is 2025, which is 45^2. Thus, 2025 will be the last number in the 45th ring, positioned at the bottom-right corner of this hexagonal spiral.

The ring that contains 2025 will have sides of length 45, and 2026 will be the first number of the next side after the bottom-right point, which implies it will be on the side ascending to the left from the bottom-right corner.

Following the pattern given, the 6 neighbors of 2026 can be generalized:

1. Directly above (i.e., one ring inside and to the top-left): 2026 - 1 = 2025.
2. To the upper-left (i.e., same ring, counterclockwise): This would be the last number of the 44th ring, which is 44^2 = 1936. But since it is one position to the upper-left of 2025, we add one, so it's 1936 + 1 = 1937.
3. To the lower-left (i.e., same ring, counterclockwise): This will be the last number of the 43rd ring, which is 43^2, but we need to add 45 (the length of a side of the 44th ring) to move one position around the 44th ring. So it's 43^2 + 45 = 1849 + 45 = 1894.
4. Directly below (i.e., one ring outside and to the bottom-right): This will be 2026 + 1 = 2027.
5. To the lower-right (i.e., same ring, clockwise): This is not a perfect square, so its calculation is more complex. It would be the next number after the length of a side of the 45th ring is added to 2026. Thus, 2026 + 45 = 2071.
6. To the upper-right (i.e., same ring, clockwise): Similar to the lower-left neighbor, we start with the bottom-right number of the 44th ring (44^2) and add 43 (the length of a side of the 44th ring). So it's 44^2 + 43 = 1936 + 43 = 1979.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the sum of the 6 neighbors:

2025 (above) +
1937 (upper-left) +
1894 (lower-left) +
2027 (below) +
2071 (lower-right) +
1979 (upper-right) = 11933

Thus, the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal grid pattern is 11933.
