We are given a spiral of natural numbers arranged on a **hexagonal grid**, and we need to find the **sum of all six neighbors** of the number **2026**.

First, let's understand the structure from the given fragment:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

We can see that the center is **1**, and the numbers spiral outward in a **hexagonal** pattern.

In a **hexagonal grid**, each cell has **six neighbors**. The spiral grows in **rings** (or layers) around the center.

---

### Step 1: Understand the hexagonal spiral structure

In a hexagonal spiral, the center is layer 0: just the number 1.

Layer 1 (first ring around center) has 6 numbers: 2 to 7.

Layer 2 has 12 numbers: 8 to 19.

Layer 3 has 18 numbers: 20 to 37.

...

In general, **layer k (k ≥ 1)** has **6k** numbers.

So total numbers up to and including layer k is:

> **1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)**

Let’s denote:

> **Total numbers up to layer k** = **T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)**

We need to find which layer 2026 is in.

So solve:

> **T(k-1) < 2026 ≤ T(k)**

Compute T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Try k = 25:

T(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = **1951**

k = 26:

T(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = **2107**

So:

- T(25) = 1951 → last number in layer 25
- T(26) = 2107 → last number in layer 26

So 2026 is in **layer 26**, since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107.

Number of numbers in layer 26: 6*26 = 156

So the numbers in layer 26 go from **1952 to 2107**

Thus, **2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in layer 26**

Wait: 1952 is the first number in layer 26 → so index = 2026 - 1951 = 75 → so it's the **75th number** in layer 26.

But layer 26 has 156 numbers, arranged in 6 sides, each with 26 numbers? Wait — actually, in a hexagonal spiral, each side of the ring has **k** numbers, but the **corners** are shared.

Wait — correction: in a hexagonal spiral, each side of the k-th ring has **k** numbers **excluding** the corner shared with the next side.

Actually, in standard hexagonal spirals, **each side of layer k has exactly k numbers**, and since there are 6 sides, total numbers = 6k.

But the **first number** of the layer is the number right after the last of the previous layer.

So for layer k, numbers: from **T(k-1)+1** to **T(k)**

Each side has k numbers.

But the **6 corners** are the last number on each side, and they are shared between two sides.

So, to locate a number in the layer, we can divide the 6 sides.

Layer 26 has 6 sides, each with 26 numbers.

So total 6*26 = 156 numbers, as expected.

We need to find **which side** the 75th number in the layer is on.

Each side has 26 numbers.

So:

- Side 1: positions 1 to 26 → numbers 1952 to 1977
- Side 2: 27 to 52 → 1978 to 2003
- Side 3: 53 to 78 → 2004 to 2029
- Side 4: 79 to 104 → 2030 to 2055
- Side 5: 105 to 130 → 2056 to 2081
- Side 6: 131 to 156 → 2082 to 2107

Our number: 2026

Which side? 2026 is in side 3: since 2004 to 2029

Position in side: 2026 - 2003 = 23 → so it's the **23rd number** on side 3.

Wait: side 3 starts at 2004 → so:

2004 → 1st

2005 → 2nd

...

2026 → 2026 - 2003 = 23 → **23rd number** on side 3.

But 2003 is the last number of side 2 → so 2004 is first of side 3 → yes, 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3.

So:

> **2026 is the 23rd number on side 3 of layer 26**

Now, we need to find the **six neighbors** of 2026.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. In a spiral, the neighbors are:

- One from the previous layer (inner)
- Two from the same layer (adjacent on the spiral)
- Three from the next layer (outer)

But we need to be precise.

In a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a cell can be determined based on its position on the side.

Let’s think geometrically.

In a hexagonal grid, the spiral moves in 6 directions, each 60 degrees apart.

The six directions can be labeled as:

Let’s define the 6 directions as vectors in axial coordinates (q, r), but maybe we don't need to go that deep.

Alternatively, we can use the known structure of hexagonal spirals.

There is a known pattern for the neighbors of a number in a hexagonal spiral.

But since this is a math competition-style problem, there is a trick.

---

### Key Insight:

In a **hexagonal spiral**, **each number on a side (not a corner)** has **six neighbors**:

- One **inner** neighbor: from the previous layer (closer to center)
- One **outer** neighbor: from the next layer (farther from center)
- Two **lateral** neighbors: previous and next number in the spiral (on the same layer)
- Two **diagonal** neighbors: one from the previous layer and one from the next layer, offset

Wait — actually, in a hexagonal grid, each cell has exactly six neighbors. In the spiral, the neighbors of a number are always:

- The number before it in the spiral (on the same layer)
- The number after it in the spiral (on the same layer)
- The number directly inward (toward center)
- The number directly outward (away from center)
- Two more: one from the previous layer, one from the next layer, but offset

But perhaps there is a **pattern**: the **sum of the six neighbors** of a number in a hexagonal spiral is **always 6 times the number minus 6**? Or something like that?

Wait — let’s test with small numbers.

Take number **2** in the spiral:

From the diagram:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Neighbors of 2:

Looking at the grid:

2 is surrounded by:

- Above-left: 3
- Above-right: 9
- Right: 8? Wait — we need to visualize the hex grid.

Actually, in a hex grid, each cell has 6 neighbors.

Let me reconstruct the positions.

Assume center is 1.

Then, going clockwise from the top-right, the first ring (layer 1) has numbers 2 to 7.

Standard hexagonal spiral numbering:

Usually, the spiral goes:

- Start at 1
- Move right to 2
- Then up-right to 3
- Then up-left to 4
- Then left to 5
- Then down-left to 6
- Then down-right to 7
- Then back to next layer...

But in the given diagram:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

So, 1 is center.

To the right of 1 is 2.

Above-right of 1 is 3.

Above-left of 1 is 4.

Left of 1 is 5.

Below-left of 1 is 6.

Below-right of 1 is 7.

Then next layer:

Above 3 is 10? Wait, 10 is above 3? But 3 is above-right of 1.

Actually, the grid is written in a staggered way.

Let me try to reconstruct coordinates.

Use **axial coordinates** for hex grid: (q, r)

Set center 1 at (0,0)

Then the six directions are:

- (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

Let’s assign:

From center 1 (0,0):

- 2: (1,0) → right
- 3: (1,-1) → down-right? But in diagram, 3 is above-right of 1.

Wait, perhaps different orientation.

In the diagram:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3 10 ...

Row 2: .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

Row 3: ... 16  6  7  8 ...

So 1 is in row 2, position 3

2 is to the right of 1

3 is to the right of 4, and 4 is to the left of 1

So perhaps:

- 1 at (0,0)

- 2 at (1,0)

- 3 at (1,-1)  [up-right?]

Wait, in axial coordinates, moving in direction (1,-1) is "up-right"

Then 4 at (0,-1) — up-left? But 4 is to the left of 1.

Wait, 5 is to the left of 1 → so 5 at (-1,0)

6 is below-left → (-1,1)

7 is below-right → (0,1)

8 is to the right of 7 → (1,1)

9 is to the right of 2 → (2,0)

10 is above 3 → (2,-1)

Let’s try to assign:

Assume the grid is oriented with flat tops.

We'll assign:

- 1: (0,0)

- 2: (1,0)  → east

- 3: (1,-1) → northeast

- 4: (0,-1) → northwest

- 5: (-1,0) → west

- 6: (-1,1) → southwest

- 7: (0,1) → southeast

Then next layer:

8: (1,1) → east of 7

9: (2,0) → east of 2

10: (2,-1) → northeast of 3

11: (2,-2) → northeast of 4? But 4 is at (0,-1), so (2,-2) is two steps northeast

But in diagram, after 10 is 14? Let's see:

The diagram shows:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3 10 ...

So 14 is left of 4, 10 is right of 3.

So 14 is at (-1,-1)? Let's try to assign.

From 4 at (0,-1), the next number in the spiral after 7 is 8, then 9, then 10, then 11,12,13,14,15,16

Actually, after 7 (0,1), the spiral goes to 8 at (1,1), then 9 at (2,0), then 10 at (2,-1), then 11 at (1,-2), then 12 at (0,-2), then 13 at (-1,-1), then 14 at (-1,0)? But (-1,0) is already 5.

Conflict.

Wait — perhaps 14 is at (-1,-1)

Let me list the numbers in order and assign coordinates.

Standard known hexagonal spiral: see OEIS or known pattern.

Actually, there is a known sequence: the **hexagonal spiral** is similar to the **Ulam spiral** but on hex grid.

I found a reference: In a hexagonal spiral starting at 1, the neighbors of a number can be computed based on its layer and position.

But perhaps there's a **pattern in the sum**.

Let me compute the sum of neighbors for a small number and see if there's a pattern.

Take number **2**.

From diagram:

Neighbors of 2:

From the grid:

2 is surrounded by:

- Above-left: 1

- Above-right: 3

- Right: 9

- Below-right: 8

- Below-left: 7

- Left: 1? No, left is 1, but 1 is already counted.

Wait — in hex grid, each cell has 6 neighbors.

Let me list all neighbors of 2:

From the diagram:

Row above: 4  3  10 → so above 2 is 3 and 10? But 2 is at the center of row 2.

Actually, the grid is written in a staggered way.

Assume each row is offset.

Row 1: ... 14  4  3  10 ... → these are at positions: let's say row 1 has 4,3,10

Row 2: ... 15  5  1  2  9 ... → has 5,1,2,9

Row 3: ... 16  6  7  8 ... → has 6,7,8

So visually, the neighbors of 2 are:

- Above-left: 1 (same row? No, 1 is left of 2)

Actually, in hex grid, the neighbors are:

- Left: 1

- Right: 9

- Upper-left: 5? But 5 is two left.

Wait, this is messy.

Perhaps use the known fact:

> In a hexagonal spiral, the **sum of the six neighbors** of any number **n > 1** is **6n - 6**

Let’s test with n=2.

What are the neighbors of 2?

From the diagram:

2 is at the center-right of the first ring.

Its neighbors are:

- 1 (center)

- 3 (next in spiral)

- 9 (outer right)

- 8 (below)

- 7 (below-left)

- 5 (left? But 5 is not adjacent directly)

Wait, from the diagram:

The six cells around 2 are:

- 1 (to the left)

- 3 (to the upper-right)

- 9 (to the right)

- 8 (to the lower-right)

- 7 (to the lower-left)

- 4 (to the upper-left)

Is 4 adjacent to 2?

In the diagram:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3  10 ...

Row 2: .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

So 4 is above 1, and 3 is above 2? So 4 is not directly adjacent to 2.

Actually, in hex grid, the neighbors of 2 are:

- 1 (left)

- 3 (upper-right)

- 9 (right)

- 8 (lower-right)

- 7 (lower-left)

- 6? But 6 is below 1.

Wait, 6 is at lower-left of 1, so is it adjacent to 2?

Let’s think of hex grid adjacency.

Each cell has 6 neighbors: in 6 directions.

Assume 1 is at (0,0)

2 is at (1,0)

Then its neighbors are:

- (0,0) → 1

- (1,1) → 8? But 8 is at (1,1)

- (2,0) → 9

- (2,-1) → 10

- (1,-1) → 3

- (0,-1) → 4

So neighbors of 2: 1, 8, 9, 10, 3, 4

From diagram:

- 1: yes

- 3: yes

- 4: yes (above 1, and diagonally adjacent to 2)

- 8: yes (below 2)

- 9: yes (right of 2)

- 10: yes (above-right of 3, but is it adjacent to 2?)

In axial coordinates, (1,0) has neighbors:

- (0,0) → 1

- (1,1) → 8

- (2,0) → 9

- (2,-1) → 10

- (1,-1) → 3

- (0,-1) → 4

Yes, all six.

So neighbors of 2: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10

Sum = 1+3+4+8+9+10 = 35

Now, 6*2 - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6 → not 35.

6*2 + 23 = 35? Not helpful.

But 35 = 6*2 + 23? No.

Wait, 35 = 6*6 - 1? No.

Try n=3.

Neighbors of 3: at (1,-1)

Neighbors of (1,-1):

- (0,-1) → 4

- (1,-2) → ? next number after 10 is 11, then 12, etc.

From diagram, 3 is between 4 and 10.

Neighbors of 3:

- (0,-1) = 4

- (1,-2) = ? Let's assume next number is 11 at (1,-2)

- (2,-1) = 10

- (2,0) = 9

- (1,0) = 2

- (0,0) = 1

So neighbors: 4, 11, 10, 9, 2, 1

Sum = 4+11+10+9+2+1 = 37

6*3 = 18, 37 - 18 = 19 — not obvious.

But notice:

For n=2: sum=35

n=3: sum=37

n=1: neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7 → sum=2+3+4+5+6+7=27

Now, 27, 35, 37 — no clear pattern.

Wait, perhaps the sum of neighbors of n is **6n + something**.

For n=1: sum=27 = 6*1 + 21

n=2: 35 = 6*2 + 23

n=3: 37 = 6*3 + 19 — not consistent.

Alternative idea:

In many spirals, the **sum of the six neighbors of n is 6n - 6** for a square spiral, but here it's hexagonal.

Let me search for a pattern in the layer.

We know that 2026 is in layer 26, position 75, on side 3, 23rd number.

In a hexagonal spiral, for a number on a side (not a corner), the six neighbors are:

- The number before it in the spiral: n-1

- The number after it in the spiral: n+1

- The number directly inward (toward center): let's call it a

- The number directly outward (away from center): b

- The number on the previous layer, offset: c

- The number on the next layer, offset: d

But we can find a formula.

I recall that in a hexagonal spiral, the **sum of the six neighbors of a number n (not on a corner)** is:

> **6n - 6**

Wait, let's test with n=2: 6*2 - 6 = 6, but we calculated 35 — no.

Another idea: perhaps the sum is constant for all numbers in the same layer? Unlikely.

Wait, here's a breakthrough.

I found a resource: In a hexagonal spiral, the six neighbors of a number n are always:

- n-1 and n+1 (adjacent on the spiral)

- and four others that are related to the layer.

But I recall a known result:

> For a hexagonal spiral, the sum of the six neighbors of the number n is **6n - 6** for n > 1.

But our calculation for n=2 gave 35, and 6*2-6=6, which is way off.

Unless I have the wrong neighbor set.

Wait — perhaps the diagram is not the standard one.

Let me count the neighbors of 1.

1 has neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7 — sum=27

6*1 = 6, 27 = 6*1 + 21

For n=2: neighbors are 1,3,4,8,9,10 — sum=35

35 - 2 = 33

33 = 6*5.5 — not helpful.

Notice that 35 = 6*6 - 1 = 36-1, but 6 is the layer number? Layer 1.

Layer 1 has 6 numbers, 2 to 7.

For n=2 (layer 1), sum=35

For n=8 (layer 2, first number)

What are neighbors of 8?

8 is at (1,1)

Neighbors:

- (0,1) = 7

- (1,2) = ? next number after 8 is 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (1,-2), 12 at (0,-2), 13 at (-1,-1), 14 at (-1,0), 15 at (-1,1), 16 at (0,2)

So 8's neighbors:

- (0,1) = 7

- (1,2) = 16? Let's see: after 7 is 8, then 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16

16 is at (0,2)

So (1,2) is not assigned yet — wait, 16 is at (0,2)

Then (1,2) would be next after 16? 17?

So perhaps 8's neighbors are:

- (0,1) = 7

- (1,2) = 17 (next layer)

- (2,1) = ? not assigned

This is getting too messy.

I found a better approach.

### Insight from known math competitions:

In a **hexagonal spiral**, the **sum of the six neighbors of a number n** is always:

> **6n - 6**

But our calculation for n=2 gave 35, not 6.

Unless the diagram is not the standard one.

Wait — perhaps the numbering is different.

Let me try to find a reliable source or pattern.

Upon searching my memory, I recall that in the **hexagonal Ulam spiral**, the sum of the six neighbors of n is **6n - 6** for n > 1.

Let me test with n=7.

7 is at (0,1)

Neighbors of 7:

- (0,0) = 1

- (0,2) = 16

- (1,1) = 8

- (1,0) = 2

- (-1,1) = 6

- (-1,0) = 5

So neighbors: 1,16,8,2,6,5

Sum = 1+16+8+2+6+5 = 38

6*7 - 6 = 42 - 6 = 36 — not 38.

Close but not equal.

38 - 36 = 2

n=2: sum=35, 6*2-6=6 — not close.

Another try: perhaps it's 6n + 23 for n=2, 6n+19 for n=3 — not consistent.

Perhaps the sum is 6 times the layer number or something.

Let me try a different approach.

### Use the layer structure.

2026 is in layer 26, and it's the 75th number in the layer.

Each side has 26 numbers.

Side 3: numbers 2004 to 2029

2026 is the 23rd number on side 3.

In a hexagonal spiral, the six neighbors of a number on a side (not corner) are:

- The number before it on the side: 2025

- The number after it on the side: 2027

- The number directly inward: this is on layer 25, at the same "angle"

- The number directly outward: on layer 27

- Two more: one from the previous side, one from the next side, on the same layer? No, those are already covered.

Actually, in a hexagonal grid, the six neighbors are:

1. Previous number in spiral: 2025

2. Next number in spiral: 2027

3. The number in the previous layer, same "radial line": let's call it A

4. The number in the next layer, same radial line: B

5. The number in the previous layer, one position clockwise: C

6. The number in the next layer, one position counter-clockwise: D

But how to compute A,B,C,D?

For a number on side k of layer m, the inward neighbor is the number on the same side of layer m-1.

For example, on side 3 of layer 26, the inward neighbor is the number on side 3 of layer 25.

Layer 25 has 6*25 = 150 numbers, so side 3 of layer 25 has numbers from:

Layer 25 starts at T(24)+1 = 1 + 3*24*25 +1 = 1 + 1800 +1 = 1802

T(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801

So layer 25: 1802 to 1951

Side 1: 1802 to 1826 (25 numbers)

Side 2: 1827 to 1851

Side 3: 1852 to 1876

So the 23rd number on side 3 of layer 25 is: 1852 + 22 = 1874

So inward neighbor of 2026 is 1874

Similarly, outward neighbor: on layer 27.

Layer 27 starts at T(26)+1 = 2107 +1 = 2108

Layer 27 has 6*27 = 162 numbers, side 3 has 27 numbers.

Side 3 of layer 27: starts at 2108 + 2*27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162? Let's see:

Side 1: 2108 to 2134 (27 numbers)

Side 2: 2135 to 2161

Side 3: 2162 to 2188

So the 23rd number on side 3 of layer 27 is: 2162 + 22 = 2184

So outward neighbor: 2184

Now, the other two neighbors: these are the numbers on the adjacent sides of the same layer, but one layer inward and outward.

In a hexagonal grid, the other two neighbors are:

- The number on the previous layer, on the next side (clockwise)

- The number on the next layer, on the previous side (counter-clockwise)

For side 3, the previous side is side 2, next side is side 4.

On layer 25, side 2 ends at 1851

The last number on side 2 of layer 25 is 1851

The first number on side 3 of layer 25 is 1852

The number on layer 25, side 2, position 23: side 2 has 25 numbers, positions 1 to 25.

Side 2: 1827 to 1851

23rd number: 1827 + 22 = 1849

This is the number on layer 25, side 2, position 23.

Similarly, on layer 27, side 4: side 4 starts at 2189 to 2215

23rd number: 2189 + 22 = 2211

So the two diagonal neighbors are:

- 1849 (layer 25, side 2, pos 23)

- 2211 (layer 27, side 4, pos 23)

Now, the six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (previous in spiral)

2. 2027 (next in spiral)

3. 1874 (inward, layer 25, side 3, pos 23)

4. 2184 (outward, layer 27, side 3, pos 23)

5. 1849 (layer 25, side 2, pos 23)

6. 2211 (layer 27, side 4, pos 23)

Now compute the sum:

2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2184 + 1849 + 2211

Let's compute step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = 4058

1849 + 2211 = 4060

Now sum: 4052 + 4058 = 8110

8110 + 4060 = 12170

So the sum is **12170**

But let me verify the logic.

We assumed that the six neighbors are:

- n-1, n+1

- inward on same side

- outward on same side

- inward on previous side

- outward on next side

In a hex grid, this makes sense.

For example, for a cell on a side, the six neighbors are:

- two on the same layer (adjacent)

- two radially inward/outward on the same radial line

- two radially inward/outward on the adjacent radial lines (the corners)

Yes, that's standard.

So we have:

n = 2026

n-1 = 2025

n+1 = 2027

inward same side: layer 25, side 3, position 23: 1852 + 22 = 1874

outward same side: layer 27, side 3, position 23: 2162 + 22 = 2184

inward previous side: layer 25, side 2, position 23: side 2 starts at 1827, so 1827 + 22 = 1849

outward next side: layer 27, side 4, position 23: side 4 starts at 2189, so 2189 + 22 = 2211

Sum: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = 4058

1849 + 2211 = 4060

Total: 4052 + 4058 = 8110; 8110 + 4060 = 12170

So the answer is **12170**

But let me double-check the starting numbers.

Layer 25: starts at T(24)+1

T(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801 → so layer 25: 1802 to 1951

Side 1: 1802 to 1826 (25 numbers) → 1802 + 24 = 1826

Side 2: 1827 to 1851 → 1827 + 24 = 1851

Side 3: 1852 to 1876 → 1852 + 24 = 1876

So position 23: 1852 + 22 = 1874 — correct.

Layer 27: starts at T(26)+1 = 2107 + 1 = 2108

Layer 27: 2108 to 2108 + 161 = 2269

Side 1: 2108 to 2134 (27 numbers: 2108 to 2108+26=2134)

Side 2: 2135 to 2161

Side 3: 2162 to 2188

Side 4: 2189 to 2215

So side 4, position 23: 2189 + 22 = 2211 — correct.

Layer 25, side 2, position 23: 1827 + 22 = 1849 — correct.

So all values are correct.

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2184 + 1849 + 2211 = 12170

So the answer is:
