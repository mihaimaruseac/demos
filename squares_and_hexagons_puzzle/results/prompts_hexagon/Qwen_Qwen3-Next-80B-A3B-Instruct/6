We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a **hexagonal grid**, and we are to find the **sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026**.

The spiral layout is shown as:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Let’s understand the structure.

---

### Step 1: Understand the hexagonal spiral layout

In a **hexagonal grid**, each cell has **6 neighbors**. The spiral starts at 1 and winds outward in layers (rings).

Looking at the given snippet:

```
Row 1:      ... 14  4  3 10 ...
Row 2:    .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
Row 3:      ... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

We can reconstruct the positions. Let’s assume the center is 1.

Let’s place the numbers in a coordinate system for a hex grid. There are several coordinate systems for hex grids (axial, offset, cube), but we can reason geometrically.

In many hexagonal spirals (like the one in Project Euler or similar problems), the numbers are arranged in concentric **hexagonal rings** around the center.

Let’s list the numbers in rings:

- **Ring 0**: center → 1 (1 number)
- **Ring 1**: around 1 → 6 numbers: 2 to 7
- **Ring 2**: next layer → 12 numbers: 8 to 19
- **Ring 3**: next → 18 numbers: 20 to 37
- ...
- **Ring k**: 6k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

Wait — let's check with the given numbers.

Given:
- 1 is center.
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are around it → that’s 6 numbers → Ring 1.
- Then 8 to 19? Let’s see:

From the diagram:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Let’s reconstruct the positions relative to 1.

Assume 1 is at the center.

Let’s assign directions in a hex grid. Common directions in hex grid (using axial coordinates) are:

- NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW

But we can also just look at the spiral order.

From the diagram:

- 1 is center.
- 2 is to the right of 1.
- 3 is above-right of 1? But 3 is next to 2 and 4.
- 4 is above 1?
- 5 is above-left of 1?
- 6 is below-left of 1?
- 7 is below 1?
- 8 is below-right of 1?

Wait — let's list the numbers in order of the spiral.

The spiral likely goes: 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 around 1, then 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 around that.

Let’s try to reconstruct the ring 1 (numbers 2-7):

From the diagram:

Row 2: ... 15 5 1 2 9 ...

So from left to right: 15, 5, 1, 2, 9

So 1 is center.

Left of 1 is 5.

Right of 1 is 2.

Above 1? In row 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...

So above 1: 4 and 3? So 4 is above-left of 1, 3 is above-right of 1?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the spiral going clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Let me try to list the numbers in order as they appear in the spiral, starting from 1.

Start at 1.

Then the next number, 2, is placed to the right.

Then 3 is placed up-right? Then 4 up? Then 5 up-left? Then 6 down-left? Then 7 down? Then 8 down-right? Then 9, 10, etc.

Actually, from the diagram:

The numbers around 1 are:

- 2: right of 1

- 3: above-right of 1? But 3 is next to 2 and 4.

In row 1: 14 4 3 10 → so 4 is left of 3, and 3 is right of 4.

So relative to 1:

- 5 is left of 1

- 6 is below-left of 1

- 7 is below 1

- 8 is below-right of 1

- 9 is right of 2? Or above-right of 2?

Wait — let’s try to reconstruct the ring 1 (6 neighbors of 1):

From the diagram:

- Above-left: 4

- Above-right: 3

- Right: 2

- Below-right: 9? But 9 is on the same row as 2 and 1? No.

Wait, row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ..

So 5 is directly left of 1.

2 is directly right of 1.

9 is directly right of 2? So 9 is two steps right of 1?

But then 3 is above 2? In row 1: 14 4 3 10 — so 4 is above-left of 1, 3 is above-right of 1, and 10 is above-right of 2?

This is messy.

Alternative approach: **Look up the known hexagonal spiral**.

Actually, this is a **known problem** — the hexagonal spiral where numbers are placed in a spiral around a hex grid, starting at 1, and each ring has 6n numbers for ring n (n≥1).

This is similar to **OEIS A003215** — the centered hexagonal numbers.

The number of cells in ring k (k≥1) is **6k**.

Total numbers up to and including ring k is:

1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

So total numbers up to ring k: **3k² + 3k + 1**

Let’s verify:

- k=0: 1 → 1

- k=1: 3(1) + 3(1) +1 = 7 → numbers 1 to 7 → correct (1 center, 6 around)

- k=2: 3*4 + 3*2 +1 = 12 + 6 +1 = 19 → numbers 1 to 19 → so ring 2 has 12 numbers: 8 to 19 → matches diagram (we see 8,9,10,14,15,16)

Yes! So the formula for the last number in ring k is: **3k² + 3k + 1**

We need to find which ring 2026 is in.

So solve: 3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026

Let’s solve 3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026

→ 3k² + 3k = 2025

→ k² + k = 675

→ k² + k - 675 = 0

Discriminant: 1 + 4*675 = 1 + 2700 = 2701

√2701 ≈ 51.97 → so k ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So k = 25: 3*(25)^2 + 3*25 + 1 = 3*625 + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = **1951**

k=26: 3*676 + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107? Wait:

Wait: 3*(26)^2 = 3*676 = 2028

3*26 = 78

So total: 2028 + 78 + 1 = **2107**

So:

- Ring 25 ends at 1951

- Ring 26 has numbers from **1952 to 2107**

So **2026 is in ring 26**

Number of numbers in ring 26: 6*26 = 156 numbers (from 1952 to 2107)

We now need to find the **position** of 2026 within ring 26.

Position in ring: 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in ring 26 (since 1952 is the first, so 2026 is 2026 - 1951 = 75th)

Wait: 1952 is the 1st, 1953 is 2nd, ..., so 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Yes.

So 2026 is the **75th number** in ring 26.

Now, in a hexagonal ring, the 6k numbers are arranged in 6 **sides**, each side having **k** numbers.

For ring k, each side has k numbers.

So for ring 26, each side has 26 numbers.

So 6 sides × 26 = 156 numbers → correct.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with 26 numbers.

We need to know **on which side** 2026 lies.

Each side has 26 numbers.

So:

- Side 1: positions 1 to 26 → numbers 1952 to 1977

- Side 2: 27 to 52 → 1978 to 2003

- Side 3: 53 to 78 → 2004 to 2029

Ah! 75 is in side 3.

Side 3: 53 to 78 → 2004 to 2029

So 2026 is the (75 - 52) = 23rd number on side 3.

Side 3 starts at 2004 (which is 53rd in ring → 1951 + 53 = 2004)

So:

- 2004 → position 53

- 2005 → 54

...

- 2026 → 75 → 75 - 52 = 23rd number on side 3.

So 2026 is the **23rd number on side 3** of ring 26.

Now, we need to find its **six neighbors**.

In a hexagonal spiral, each number has 6 neighbors:

- Two neighbors on the **same ring** (previous and next number in the ring)

- One neighbor on the **inner ring** (ring k-1)

- One neighbor on the **outer ring** (ring k+1)

- Two neighbors on the **same "radial" line**? Actually, in hex grid, each cell has 6 neighbors, and the spiral structure ensures that:

For a number on ring k (k ≥ 2), its neighbors are:

1. The previous number in the ring (if not the first on the side)

2. The next number in the ring (if not the last on the side)

3. One neighbor in the **inner ring** (ring k-1)

4. One neighbor in the **outer ring** (ring k+1)

5. Two more neighbors: one is "corner" adjacent? Actually, the structure is such that each number on a side has:

- One neighbor on the inner ring (radially inward)

- One neighbor on the outer ring (radially outward)

- One neighbor on the same side (adjacent along the side)

- One neighbor on the next side (at the corner)

Wait — perhaps a better way is to use known properties of hexagonal spirals.

There is a known pattern: for a number on ring k, on side s, at position p (1 to k), its neighbors are:

Let me recall: in hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number on ring k, side s, position p are:

- Previous number in ring: if p > 1 → number = current - 1

- Next number in ring: if p < k → number = current + 1

- Inner ring neighbor: located on ring k-1, side s, position p

- Outer ring neighbor: located on ring k+1, side s, position p

- The two "corner" neighbors: one on side s-1, last position (k) of inner ring? and one on side s+1, first position (1) of outer ring? Not exactly.

Actually, the neighbors are:

For a number N on ring k, side s, position p (1 ≤ p ≤ k):

Its six neighbors are:

1. **N - 1**: previous number in ring (if p > 1)

2. **N + 1**: next number in ring (if p < k)

3. **Inner ring neighbor**: the number on ring k-1, side s, position p → call it I

4. **Outer ring neighbor**: the number on ring k+1, side s, position p → call it O

5. **"Left" corner neighbor**: on ring k-1, side s-1, position p-1 (if p > 1) OR if p=1, then it's the last position of side s-1 of ring k-1

6. **"Right" corner neighbor**: on ring k+1, side s+1, position p (if p < k) OR if p=k, then it's the first position of side s+1 of ring k+1

This is getting complex.

Alternatively, we can use a **known formula or pattern** from similar problems.

In fact, this is **exactly the same as Project Euler Problem 28**, but on a hex grid instead of square.

Actually, I recall a similar problem: **Hexagonal spiral neighbor sum**.

There is a known result: **For any number N > 1 on ring k, the six neighbors are:**

- N-1

- N+1

- The number directly inward (on ring k-1, same side, same position)

- The number directly outward (on ring k+1, same side, same position)

- The number on the previous side, last position of ring k-1

- The number on the next side, first position of ring k+1

Wait — perhaps we can compute the **inner neighbor** and **outer neighbor** using formulas.

Let’s denote:

Let N = 2026

Ring k = 26

Position in ring: 75th → side 3, position 23 (since side 3: 53 to 78 → 26 numbers, so 75 - 52 = 23)

Side 3: positions 53 to 78 → 26 numbers → 2004 to 2029

So 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3.

Now, the **inner neighbor** is on ring 25, side 3, position 23.

Ring 25 ends at 1951.

Ring 25 has 6*25 = 150 numbers → from 1802 to 1951? Wait:

Wait, ring k has numbers from [3(k-1)^2 + 3(k-1) + 2] to [3k^2 + 3k + 1]

Actually, ring k starts at: 3(k-1)^2 + 3(k-1) + 2

For k=26: starts at 3*25^2 + 3*25 + 2 = 3*625 + 75 + 2 = 1875 + 75 + 2 = 1952 → correct.

Ring k ends at 3k² + 3k + 1

So ring 25 ends at 3*25² + 3*25 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951

Ring 25 starts at: 3*24² + 3*24 + 2 = 3*576 + 72 + 2 = 1728 + 72 + 2 = 1802

So ring 25: numbers 1802 to 1951

Each side has 25 numbers.

Side 3 of ring 25: positions 53 to 77? Wait:

Side 1: 1-25 → 1802 to 1826

Side 2: 26-50 → 1827 to 1851

Side 3: 51-75 → 1852 to 1876

Wait, let's compute:

Side 1: positions 1 to 25 → numbers 1802 to 1826

Side 2: 26 to 50 → 1827 to 1851

Side 3: 51 to 75 → 1852 to 1876

But we need position 23 on side 3 → that's the 23rd number in side 3 → 1852 + 22 = 1874

So inner neighbor = 1874

Similarly, outer neighbor is on ring 27, side 3, position 23

Ring 27: k=27

Starts at: 3*26² + 3*26 + 2 = 3*676 + 78 + 2 = 2028 + 78 + 2 = 2108

Ends at: 3*27² + 3*27 + 1 = 3*729 + 81 + 1 = 2187 + 81 + 1 = 2269

Each side has 27 numbers.

Side 3: positions 53 to 79? Wait:

Side 1: 1-27 → 2108 to 2134

Side 2: 28-54 → 2135 to 2161

Side 3: 55-81 → 2162 to 2188

So position 23 on side 3 → 2162 + 22 = 2184

So outer neighbor = 2184

Now, the two **side neighbors**:

- Previous number in ring: 2025

- Next number in ring: 2027

But wait — 2026 is on side 3, position 23, and side 3 has 26 numbers (positions 53 to 78), so 2026 is not at the end, so yes, both neighbors exist.

So neighbors so far:

- 2025

- 2027

- inner: 1874

- outer: 2184

Now the two **corner neighbors**.

In hexagonal spiral, the two remaining neighbors are:

- One on the **previous side** of the **inner ring** (ring k-1), at the **last position** of side s-1

- One on the **next side** of the **outer ring** (ring k+1), at the **first position** of side s+1

Why?

Because in hex grid, each number has two neighbors that are "diagonal" — one from the inner ring on the previous side, and one from the outer ring on the next side.

Let’s see:

For number at side s, position p, the two corner neighbors are:

- **Corner 1**: on ring k-1, side s-1, last position (position k-1)

- **Corner 2**: on ring k+1, side s+1, first position (position 1)

In our case:

s = 3, k = 26

So:

- Corner 1: ring 25, side 2, last position (25)

Side 2 of ring 25: positions 26 to 50 → numbers 1827 to 1851

Last position: 1851

- Corner 2: ring 27, side 4, first position (1)

Ring 27, side 4: starts at 2189 (since side 3 ends at 2188, side 4 starts at 2189)

So first number on side 4: 2189

So the six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (previous in ring)

2. 2027 (next in ring)

3. 1874 (inner ring, same side, same position)

4. 2184 (outer ring, same side, same position)

5. 1851 (inner ring, previous side, last position)

6. 2189 (outer ring, next side, first position)

Now, let’s sum them up:

List:

- 2025

- 2027

- 1874

- 2184

- 1851

- 2189

Let’s add step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = 4058

1851 + 2189 = 4040

Now sum: 4052 + 4058 + 4040

= (4052 + 4040) = 8092

8092 + 4058 = 12150

Wait: 4052 + 4058 = 8110

8110 + 4040 = 12150

So total sum = **12150**

Let me double-check the numbers:

1. 2025 → yes, 2026 - 1

2. 2027 → yes, 2026 + 1

3. inner: ring 25, side 3, position 23 → side 3: 1852 to 1876 → 1852 + 22 = 1874 → correct

4. outer: ring 27, side 3, position 23 → side 3: 2162 to 2188 → 2162 + 22 = 2184 → correct

5. inner corner: ring 25, side 2, last position → side 2 ends at 1851 → correct

6. outer corner: ring 27, side 4, first position → side 3 ends at 2188, so side 4 starts at 2189 → correct

All numbers are correct.

Sum:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 2184 = 4058

1851 + 2189 = 4040

Now 4052 + 4058 = 8110

8110 + 4040 = 12150

✅
