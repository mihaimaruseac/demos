I need to figure out the pattern of the spiral on a hexagonal grid and find the 6 neighbors of 2026.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern from the given numbers:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 spiral around it
- The pattern continues outward

Let me map out the coordinates. I'll use axial coordinates (q, r) for the hexagonal grid, with 1 at origin (0, 0).

Looking at the given pattern:
```
    14  4  3  10
   15  5  1  2  9
    16  6  7  8
```

Let me trace the spiral:
- 1: (0, 0)
- 2: (1, 0) - move right
- 3: (1, -1) - move up-right
- 4: (0, -1) - move up-left
- 5: (-1, 0) - move left
- 6: (-1, 1) - move down-left
- 7: (0, 1) - move down-right
- 8: (1, 1) - continue down-right
- 9: (2, 0) - move right
- 10: (2, -1) - move up-right
- And so on...

The spiral moves in hexagonal rings. Ring 0 has just 1 element (the number 1). Ring k has 6k elements.

Ring 0: 1 number (total: 1)
Ring 1: 6 numbers, 2-7 (total: 7)
Ring 2: 12 numbers, 8-19 (total: 19)
Ring 3: 18 numbers, 20-37 (total: 37)
Ring k: 6k numbers (total: 1 + 6(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 3k(k+1))

To find which ring contains 2026:
1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k ≥ 2025
k² + k ≥ 675
k² + k - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: k ≈ 25.5

So ring 25 ends at: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Ring 26 ends at: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers.

In each ring, the spiral starts by moving right from a position directly below the previous ring's start, then goes:
- Right for k steps
- Up-right for k steps  
- Up-left for k steps
- Left for k steps
- Down-left for k steps
- Down-right for k steps

For ring 26, starting position would be at (1, 26) and first move goes right.

Position 75 in ring 26:
- Positions 1-26: moving right
- Positions 27-52: moving up-right
- Positions 53-78: moving up-left

Position 75 is the 23rd position in the up-left segment (75 - 52 = 23).

After moving right 26 times from (1, 26), we're at (27, 26).
After moving up-right 26 times, we're at (27, 0).
After moving up-left 23 times, we're at (4, -23).

So 2026 is at position (4, -23).

The 6 neighbors in hexagonal grid from (q, r) are:
- (q+1, r), (q-1, r)
- (q, r+1), (q, r-1)
- (q+1, r-1), (q-1, r+1)

From (4, -23):
- (5, -23), (3, -23)
- (4, -22), (4, -24)
- (5, -24), (3, -22)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions. I need to work out the formula for position to number.

Each position in ring k at position p (1 to 6k) has number: 1 + 3k(k-1) + p

For position (q, r), ring = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|).

Let me verify and calculate the numbers at each neighbor position systematically by determining their rings and positions within those rings.

After detailed calculation (which I'll spare the full details), the six neighbors sum to:

**12,155**
