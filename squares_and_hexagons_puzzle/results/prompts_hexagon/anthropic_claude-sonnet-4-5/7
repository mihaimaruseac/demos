I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form the first ring around 1
- 8, 9, 10, ..., continue in the next ring

Let me establish a coordinate system. I'll use axial coordinates for the hexagonal grid where the center (number 1) is at (0, 0).

The spiral moves:
- 1 at (0, 0)
- 2 to the right at (1, 0)
- Then the spiral goes counterclockwise

Let me trace the pattern more carefully:
- 1: center
- 2: right of 1
- 3-7: complete the first hexagonal ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19: second hexagonal ring (12 numbers)
- 20-37: third hexagonal ring (18 numbers)

The rings have 6, 12, 18, 24, ... numbers (6n for ring n, n ≥ 1).

The total numbers through ring n is: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring n ends at position 3n² + 3n + 1

For n = 25: 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
For n = 26: 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, which contains numbers from 1952 to 2107.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers.
Position within ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Now I need to understand the spiral direction. Looking at the example:
- After 1, we go right to 2
- The spiral continues counterclockwise

In ring n, starting from the rightmost position, the spiral goes:
1. Right-most position, then moving in 6 directions around the hexagon
2. Each of the 6 edges has n positions

For ring 26, each edge has 26 positions.
Position 75 in the ring: 75 = 2×26 + 23, so we're 23 positions into the 3rd edge.

Let me use a different approach with hex coordinates (q, r):
- Start at (26, 0) for position 1952 (start of ring 26)
- Move counterclockwise

The 6 directions in hex coordinates:
1. Edge 1 (positions 1-26): going up-left
2. Edge 2 (positions 27-52): going left  
3. Edge 3 (positions 53-78): going down-left
4. Edge 4 (positions 79-104): going down-right
5. Edge 5 (positions 105-130): going right
6. Edge 6 (positions 131-156): going up-right

Position 75 is in edge 3 (positions 53-78), specifically at position 75-52 = 23 into edge 3.

For ring 26:
- Edge 1 starts at (26, 0) going direction (-1, -1)
- Edge 2 starts at (0, -26) going direction (-1, 0)
- Edge 3 starts at (-26, -26) going direction (0, 1)

Position 75 = position 23 of edge 3:
Starting at (-26, -26), moving direction (0, 1) for 22 steps (0-indexed):
Position of 2026: (-26, -26 + 22) = (-26, -4)

The 6 neighbors in hex coordinates are at offsets:
(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)

Neighbors of (-26, -4):
- (-25, -4)
- (-27, -4)
- (-26, -3)
- (-26, -5)
- (-25, -5)
- (-27, -3)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions. Each is in ring 26 or 27.

After careful calculation of positions in the spiral (checking which edge and position each neighbor falls on), the six neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 1975, 2076, 2077, 1974

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1975 + 2076 + 2077 + 1974 = 12154

The answer is **12154**.
