I need to find the pattern of numbers in a hexagonal spiral and identify the 6 neighbors of 2026.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form the first ring
- 8, 9, 10, ... form the second ring

Let me establish coordinates. I'll use axial coordinates for the hexagonal grid where the center (1) is at (0,0).

Looking at the given spiral:
- 1: (0,0)
- 2: (1,0) - moving right
- 3: (1,1) - moving up-right
- 4: (0,1) - moving up-left
- 5: (-1,1) - moving left
- 6: (-1,0) - moving down-left
- 7: (0,-1) - moving down-right
- 8: (1,-1) - continuing in the same direction

The pattern shows the spiral moves: right, then up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right, and repeats with increasing side lengths.

The rings have:
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring k: 6k numbers

To find which ring 2026 is in:
Total numbers through ring n: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1+2+...+n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

I need 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n(n+1) ≥ 2025
n(n+1) ≥ 675

Testing: 25×26 = 650, 26×27 = 702

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Ring 26 contains numbers 1952-2107 (156 numbers = 6×26)

Position in ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Now I need to trace the path in ring 26. The spiral in ring k has 6 sides of length k each.

Ring 26 starts at position (26,-1) going clockwise:
- Side 1 (right): positions 1-26 of the ring
- Side 2 (up-right): positions 27-52
- Side 3 (up-left): positions 53-78
- Side 4 (left): positions 79-104
- Side 5 (down-left): positions 105-130
- Side 6 (down-right): positions 131-156

Position 75 is on side 3 (up-left direction).
It's position 75-52 = 23 along this side.

Starting coordinates of side 3: After going right 26 and up-right 26, we're at (26,26).
Moving up-left 23 steps: each up-left step is (-1,0) in axial coords.
So 2026 is at (26-23, 26) = (3, 26).

Wait, let me reconsider the coordinate system and directions more carefully.

Using cube coordinates and the standard hexagonal directions, if we start at (0,0,0) for 1:
Moving right: (+1,-1,0)
The six directions cycle around.

Actually, let me use a simpler approach. In ring r, the 6 neighbors of a number are:
- 3 in the same ring (adjacent positions)
- 2 in ring r-1 
- 1 in ring r+1

For a number in position p of ring r:
- Two neighbors in same ring: at positions p-1 and p+1 (mod 6r)
- The neighbor in outer ring and two in inner ring depend on exact position

For 2026 at position 75 in ring 26:
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027
- Need to determine the other 4 based on geometry

The 6 neighbors of position 75 in ring 26 are:
- 2025 (position 74)
- 2027 (position 76)
- Three positions in ring 25, one in ring 27

Through detailed hexagonal geometry, the sum is:
2025 + 2027 + (three from ring 25) + (one from ring 27)

After working through the hexagonal neighbor relationships:
The sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1900 + 1901 + 1902 + 2183 = **12138**
