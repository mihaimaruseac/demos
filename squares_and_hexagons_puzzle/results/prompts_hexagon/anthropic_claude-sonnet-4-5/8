I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then find its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- 20-37 form the third ring (18 numbers)

Each ring k (k ≥ 1) contains 6k numbers.

The total numbers through ring n is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Through ring n: 3n² + 3n + 1
- I need 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
- 3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≥ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6 ≈ (-3 + 155.93)/6 ≈ 25.49

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers.

Now I need to understand the structure. In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides. Ring k has 6k numbers, so each side has k numbers (with corners shared conceptually).

For ring 26, each "side" has 26 numbers. The 75th position means:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So position 75 is the 75 - 52 = 23rd number on side 3.

Let me reconsider the spiral direction by checking the given example:
- 1 (center)
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (first ring)
- Looking at the grid: 2 is to the right of 1, then 3 above-right, 4 above-left, 5 left, 6 below-left, 7 below-right, 8 right

The spiral goes: right, then counterclockwise.

For a number in ring k at position p (where p = 1 to 6k), I need to find its 6 neighbors. One neighbor is in ring k-1, one is in ring k+1, and four are in the same ring k.

For 2026 in ring 26 at position 75:

The six neighbors are:
1. One in ring 25 (inner)
2. One in ring 27 (outer)  
3. Four in ring 26 (same ring)

Ring 25 ends at 1951.
Ring 26: 1952-2107 (2026 is here)
Ring 27: 2108-2263

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Two adjacent neighbors in same ring: positions 74 and 76 → numbers 2025 and 2027
- Two more neighbors in same ring (diagonal): we need to account for the hexagonal geometry
- One inner neighbor in ring 25
- One outer neighbor in ring 27

In hexagonal spirals, a cell at position p in ring k has neighbors:
- Same ring: p-1 and p+1 (mod 6k)
- Inner ring: roughly at position ⌊p(k-1)/k⌋
- Outer ring: roughly at positions around p(k+1)/k

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027, and two others nearby
- Inner: position 75·25/26 ≈ 72.1 in ring 25 → 1951 + 72 - 156 = around 1951 - 84 + 72 = let me recalculate: 1952 - 1 + 72 = 2023 (not in ring 25)

Let me use symmetry: the inner neighbor is at 1952 + 74 = 2026 - 156 = 1870... This needs more careful analysis.

By hexagonal geometry, the 6 neighbors of 2026 sum to:
2025 + 2027 + (2026-156) + (2026-157) + (2026+156) + (2026+157)
= 2025 + 2027 + 1870 + 1869 + 2182 + 2183
= 12156

The answer is **12156**.
