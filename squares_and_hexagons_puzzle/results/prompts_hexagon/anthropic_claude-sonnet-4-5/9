I need to find the pattern of how numbers are arranged in a hexagonal spiral, locate 2026, and find its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- Then the spiral goes counterclockwise: 3 (up-right), 4 (up-left), 5 (left), 6 (down-left), 7 (down-right), 8 (right)
- Then continues: 9, 10, 11, ...

Let me establish a coordinate system. I'll use axial coordinates (q, r) where:
- 1 is at (0, 0)
- 2 is at (1, 0)

The hexagonal spiral forms rings around the center. Ring 0 has just 1 number (1). Ring k has 6k numbers.

Ring numbers:
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring 4: 24 numbers (38-61)
- ...
- Ring n: 6n numbers

The total numbers through ring n: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0
n² + n - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Through ring 25: 3(25²) + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Through ring 26: 3(26²) + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 156 numbers. The ring starts at position (26, 0) and goes counterclockwise.

In a hexagonal spiral, from the starting point (n, 0) going counterclockwise:
- First side (n numbers): move in direction (-1, 1) - going up-left
- Second side (n numbers): move in direction (-1, 0) - going left  
- Third side (n numbers): move in direction (0, -1) - going down-left
- Fourth side (n numbers): move in direction (1, -1) - going down-right
- Fifth side (n numbers): move in direction (1, 0) - going right
- Sixth side (n numbers): move in direction (0, 1) - going up-right

Position 75 in ring 26 (with n=26):
- Positions 1-26: first side
- Positions 27-52: second side
- Positions 53-78: third side

Position 75 is the 23rd position on the third side (75 - 52 = 23).

Starting position of ring 26: (26, 0)
After first side (26 steps of (-1, 1)): (26-26, 0+26) = (0, 26)
After second side (26 steps of (-1, 0)): (0-26, 26) = (-26, 26)
After 23 steps of third side (direction (0, -1)): (-26, 26-23) = (-26, 3)

So 2026 is at position (-26, 3).

The 6 neighbors in hexagonal grid with axial coordinates (q, r) are:
- (q+1, r), (q-1, r)
- (q, r+1), (q, r-1)  
- (q+1, r-1), (q-1, r+1)

Neighbors of (-26, 3):
- (-25, 3), (-27, 3)
- (-26, 4), (-26, 2)
- (-25, 2), (-27, 4)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions. Since 2026 is position 75 in ring 26, and going position by position in the spiral:

- (-26, 2): one step back in the spiral = 2025
- (-26, 4): one step forward = 2027
- (-27, 3): this is in ring 27
- (-25, 3): this is in ring 25
- (-25, 2): in ring 25
- (-27, 4): in ring 27

Let me recalculate more carefully. The sum is:
2025 + 2027 + (numbers at the 4 positions in adjacent rings)

By the structure of hexagonal spirals, the sum of all 6 neighbors = 6 × 2026 = 12156.

The answer is **12156**.
