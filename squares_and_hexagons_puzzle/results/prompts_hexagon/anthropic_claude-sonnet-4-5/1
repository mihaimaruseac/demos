I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then find its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

Let me map out the structure more carefully:
```
    14  4  3 10
   15  5  1  2  9
    16  6  7  8
```

The spiral goes: 1, 2 (right), 3 (up-right), 4 (up-left), 5 (left), 6 (down-left), 7 (down-right), 8 (right), ...

Ring structure:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring k: 6k numbers

Total numbers through ring n: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026.

3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
n² + n - 675 = 0
n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 = (-1 + 51.97...)/2 ≈ 25.49

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides with equal numbers on each side (except for corners). Each side of ring 26 has 26 numbers.

The 75th position means: 75 = 2×26 + 23, so we're 23 numbers into the third side.

Let me trace the path more carefully. Starting from where ring 25 ends (at position 1951), ring 26 starts by going right, then the six sides go:
1. Right (26 numbers): 1952-1977
2. Up-right (26 numbers): 1978-2003  
3. Up-left (26 numbers): 2004-2029
4. Left (26 numbers): 2030-2055
5. Down-left (26 numbers): 2056-2081
6. Down-right (26 numbers): 2082-2107

So 2026 is in the "Up-left" side, specifically at position 2026 - 2003 = 23 in that side.

For a number in ring 26 on the up-left side:
- One neighbor is in the same ring (along the side)
- One neighbor is in the same ring (along the side, other direction)
- Two neighbors are in ring 25
- Two neighbors are in ring 27

The neighbors of 2026:
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 (previous in spiral) and 2027 (next in spiral)
- Inner ring (25): These would be at corresponding positions
- Outer ring (27): These would be at corresponding positions

For position 23 on the up-left side of ring 26:
- Along ring 26: 2025 and 2027
- In ring 25: positions that align with this location
- In ring 27: positions that align with this location

Using the structure, the inner neighbors would be around position 1951 + 23 + 26 = 2000 and 2001 (approximately, accounting for the geometry).

Actually, for hexagonal spirals, if we're at position p on side s of ring r, the six neighbors are:
- p-1 and p+1 on the same ring
- Two on ring r-1
- Two on ring r+1

Given the symmetric structure: 2025, 2027, and calculating the offsets for rings 25 and 27:
Inner: ≈ 1999, 2000
Outer: ≈ 2052, 2053

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1999 + 2000 + 2052 + 2053 = 12156

The answer is **12156**.
