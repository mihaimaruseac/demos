I need to figure out the pattern of the spiral on a hexagonal grid and find the positions of numbers around 2026.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern from the given example:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is above-right of 1
- The spiral goes: 1, 2 (right), then counterclockwise: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

Let me trace the spiral more carefully:
- Position 1: center
- Position 2: one step right
- Positions 3-4: moving up-left direction (3 is above 2, 4 is above-left of 3)
- Positions 5-7: moving left
- Positions 8-10: moving down
- And so on...

The spiral moves outward in rings. Let me identify the ring structure:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: 6n numbers

The last number in ring n is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- 3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026
- 3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
- n² + n - 675 = 0
- n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 = (-1 + 51.97...)/2 ≈ 25.49

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides with n numbers on each side (where n is the ring number). For ring 26, each side has 26 numbers.

The 75th position in ring 26:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So position 75 is the 75-52 = 23rd position on side 3.

Now I need to understand the geometry. In a hexagonal spiral going counterclockwise starting from the right:
- Side 1: going up-left
- Side 2: going left  
- Side 3: going down-left
- Side 4: going down-right
- Side 5: going right
- Side 6: going up-right

Position 75 (which is 2026) is at position 23 of side 3.

For any number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), its 6 neighbors are:
- 2 neighbors along the same ring (positions 74 and 76 in ring 26)
- 2 neighbors in the inner ring (ring 25)
- 2 neighbors in the outer ring (ring 27)

The neighbors along ring 26: 2025 and 2027

For the inner ring neighbors, I need to map position 75 in ring 26 to ring 25:
Position 75 in ring 26 corresponds roughly to position 75·(150/156) ≈ 72 in ring 25
The two inner neighbors would be around: 1951 - 150 + 72 = 1873 and 1874

For outer ring neighbors in ring 27:
Position 75 maps to approximately 75·(162/156) ≈ 78 in ring 27
These would be around: 2107 + 78 = 2185 and 2186

Let me recalculate more carefully. Position 75 on side 3, position 23 of that side.
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring: 1951 + 23 = 1974, 1975
- Outer ring: 2107 + 75 = 2182, 2183

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1974 + 1975 + 2182 + 2183 = 12366

The answer is **12366**.
