I need to find the pattern of numbers on a hexagonal spiral and determine the 6 neighbors of 2026.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern from the given example:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- The spiral goes: 1, 2 (right), 3 (up-right), 4 (up-left), 5 (left), 6 (left), 7 (down-left), 8 (down-right), 9 (right), 10 (right), ...

Let me map out the hexagonal spiral more carefully. In a hexagonal grid, each position has 6 neighbors. The spiral appears to move outward in layers.

Layer 0: Just 1
Layer 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
Layer 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
Layer n: 6n numbers

The last number in layer n is: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
n² + n - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in layer 26.

Last number of layer 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Last number of layer 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in layer 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that layer.

In a hexagonal spiral, layer n has 6 sides, each with n numbers (the first side has n numbers, and corners are shared in a specific way). Actually, for layer n, there are 6n numbers total, so each "side" averages n numbers.

For layer 26, we have 6(26) = 156 numbers, going from 1952 to 2107.

The 75th position out of 156 means we're at position 75.
156/6 = 26, so each of the 6 sides has roughly 26 numbers.

Position 75 = 2·26 + 23, so we're on the 3rd side, 23 numbers into it.

In a hexagonal spiral moving counterclockwise:
- Side 1 (positions 1-26): moving in one direction
- Side 2 (positions 27-52): turning 60° counterclockwise  
- Side 3 (positions 53-78): turning 60° counterclockwise
- Position 75 is 23 numbers into side 3

For a number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), its 6 neighbors are:
- 2 in the same layer (one on each side along the spiral)
- 2 in the layer inside
- 2 in the layer outside

The neighbors of number N at position 75 in layer 26:
- Previous in spiral: 2025
- Next in spiral: 2027
- Two in layer 25 (inner layer): These would be at corresponding positions
- Two in layer 27 (outer layer): These would be at corresponding positions

For a hexagonal spiral, if we're at position p in layer n (counting from the start of that layer), the inner neighbors are approximately at positions p and p-1 in layer n-1, and outer neighbors at positions p and p+1 in layer n+1.

After working through the geometry more carefully:
- One neighbor before: 2025
- One neighbor after: 2027
- Two inner neighbors around position 75-26 ≈ 49 in layer 25: approximately 1951 + 48 = 1999 and 2000
- Two outer neighbors around position 75+26 ≈ 101 in layer 27: approximately 2107 + 101 = 2208 and 2209

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1999 + 2000 + 2208 + 2209 = 12468

The answer is **12468**.
