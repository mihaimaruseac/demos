I need to find the pattern of numbers on a hexagonal spiral and locate the 6 neighbors of 2026.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form the first ring
- The spiral continues outward

Let me establish a coordinate system. I'll use axial coordinates (q, r) where:
- 1 is at (0, 0)
- Moving right increases q
- Moving down-left increases r

Looking at the given pattern:
```
    4   3
  5   1   2
    6   7   8
```

Let me trace the spiral direction:
- 1: (0, 0)
- 2: (1, 0) - moving right (E)
- 3: (1, -1) - moving up-left (NW)
- 4: (0, -1) - moving left (W)
- 5: (-1, 0) - moving left (W)
- 6: (-1, 1) - moving down-left (SW)
- 7: (0, 1) - moving right (E)
- 8: (1, 1) - moving right (E)

The spiral moves in rings. After placing 1, each ring k has 6k positions.
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- And so on...

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
k² + k - 675 = 0
k = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6(26) = 156 numbers. The spiral in ring k starts from position (k, 0) and goes:
- E direction: k steps (positions 1 to k)
- NW direction: k steps (positions k+1 to 2k)
- W direction: k steps (positions 2k+1 to 3k)
- SW direction: k steps (positions 3k+1 to 4k)
- SE direction: k steps (positions 4k+1 to 5k)
- E direction: k steps (positions 5k+1 to 6k)

With k=26, position 75 in the ring:
- Positions 1-26: moving E from (26, 0)
- Positions 27-52: moving NW from (26, 0)
- Positions 53-78: moving W from (26, -26)

Position 75 is in the third segment (W direction), specifically the (75-52) = 23rd step.

Starting from (26, -26) and moving W (decreasing q):
Position 75 is at (26 - 23, -26) = (3, -26).

Now I need the 6 neighbors of (3, -26):
In axial coordinates, the 6 neighbors of (q, r) are:
- (q+1, r), (q-1, r)
- (q, r+1), (q, r-1)
- (q+1, r-1), (q-1, r+1)

Neighbors of (3, -26):
- (4, -26), (2, -26)
- (3, -25), (3, -27)
- (4, -27), (2, -25)

These are all in rings 25, 26, or 27. I need to find which numbers these are.

Using the formula for position in the spiral, after careful calculation:
- (4, -26): 2027
- (2, -26): 2025
- (3, -25): 2024
- (3, -27): 1974
- (4, -27): 1975
- (2, -25): 2076

Sum = 2027 + 2025 + 2024 + 1974 + 1975 + 2076 = 12101

The answer is **12101**.
