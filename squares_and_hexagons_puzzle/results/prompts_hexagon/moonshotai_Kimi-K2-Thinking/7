 **Answer: 12168**  

**Explanation**

The numbers are placed on a hexagonal spiral.  
For any cell we can determine its “ring’’ \(r\) (the distance from the centre) and its index \(i\) inside that ring.  

* The centre is ring 0, number 1.  
* Ring \(r\;(r\ge1)\) contains \(6r\) cells, numbered consecutively while walking counter‑clockwise around the hexagon.  

If  

\[
T(r)=1+3r(r+1)
\]

is the last number of ring \(r\) (the centred hexagonal numbers 1, 7, 19, 37,…), then the numbers in ring \(r\) are  

\[
N(r,i)=T(r-1)+i+1\qquad (0\le i<6r).
\]

For a cell with index \(i\) the neighbours are

* the two cells on the same ring: \(N(r,i-1)\) and \(N(r,i+1)\) (indices taken modulo \(6r\));
* two cells on the next inner ring (different for a corner cell and a mid‑edge cell);
* two cells on the next outer ring.

### 1.  Locate 2026

\(2026\) lies in ring \(r=26\) because  

\[
T(25)=1951<2026\le T(26)=2107 .
\]

Its index inside the ring is  

\[
i=2026-T(25)-1=2026-1951-1=74 .
\]

Since \(0\le i<6r\) we have  

\[
\text{edge}=e=\Big\lfloor\frac{i}{r}\Big\rfloor=2,\qquad
\text{offset}=k=i\bmod r=22 .
\]

Because \(k\neq r-1\) the cell is a **mid‑edge** cell on the edge between the NE and NW corners.  
Its axial coordinates are  

\[
(q,r)=(d-(k+1),\,-d)=(26-23,\,-26)=(3,-26).
\]

### 2.  Its six neighbours  

| direction | axial coordinate | ring | index \(i\) | number |
|-----------|------------------|------|------------|--------|
| west (prev) | \((2,-26)\) | 26 | 73 | 2025 |
| east (next) | \((4,-26)\) | 26 | 75 | 2027 |
| inner 1    | \((2,-25)\) | 25 | 72 | 1874 |
| inner 2    | \((3,-25)\) | 25 | 71 | 1873 |
| outer 1    | \((3,-27)\) | 27 | 76 | 2184 |
| outer 2    | \((4,-27)\) | 27 | 77 | 2185 |

The numbers of the two cells on the same ring are simply \(2026-1\) and \(2026+1\).  
For the inner and outer neighbours we used the same formula \(N(r,i)=T(r-1)+i+1\) after computing their indices from their coordinates.

---

### 3.  Sum of the neighbours  

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{same‑ring}   &: 2025+2027 = 4052,\\
\text{inner ring} &: 1874+1873 = 3747,\\
\text{outer ring} &: 2184+2185 = 4369.
\end{aligned}
\]

Adding them,

\[
4052+3747+4369 = 12168 .
\]

Hence the sum of the six numbers adjacent to 2026 is  

\[
\boxed{12168}.
