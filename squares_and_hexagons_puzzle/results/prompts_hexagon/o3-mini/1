We will show that if you “read‐off” the six natural–number “neighbors” of 2026 in the hex–spiral arrangement

  … 14 4 3 10 …  
  .. 15 5 1 2 9 …  
  … 16 6 7 8 …  

the sum you get is 12168.

In what follows we describe one (fairly long–winded) way to arrive at that result. (Any approach that “locates” 2026 on the hexagon and then finds the numbers in the six adjacent cells will do.) 

For background, here is one way to “index” the spiral.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A “coordinate” description of the spiral

Place 1 at the center with “axial‐coordinates” (q,r) = (0,0). Then choose the six principal neighbor–directions as

  d₀ = (0, –1)
  d₁ = (–1, 0)
  d₂ = (–1, 1)
  d₃ = (0, 1)
  d₄ = (1, 0)
  d₅ = (1, –1).

Then the six neighbors of 1 come out as
  (1,0)    → 2,
  (1, –1)  → 3,
  (0, –1)  → 4,
  (–1, 0)  → 5,
  (–1, 1)  → 6,
  (0, 1)   → 7.
One may check that these agree with the “picture” above.

For every natural number (except 1) the spiral lies in a “ring” (or “corona”). In our spiral the k-th ring (with k ≥ 1) consists of the 6k numbers that “surround” the previous rings. It turns out that the last number in the (k–1)th ring is

  T(k–1) = 3(k–1)·k + 1,
so that the numbers in the k‑th ring run from
  3(k–1)·k + 2  up to 3k(k+1) + 1.

Thus, for example, ring 1 goes from 2 to 7 and ring 26 goes from
  3·25·26 + 2 = 1952   to 2107 = 3·26·27 + 1.
Since 1952 ≤ 2026 ≤ 2107, the number 2026 lies in ring 26.

It is also natural to “trace” the k‑th ring in a counterclockwise cycle in six “segments” (one on each side). One may choose the “starting point” P₀ for ring n to be (n,0) (which is the place of the first number in that ring). Then one writes the points of ring n as follows. Define the six unit–steps by

  d₀ = (0, –1),
  d₁ = (–1, 0),
  d₂ = (–1, 1),
  d₃ = (0, 1),
  d₄ = (1, 0),
  d₅ = (1, –1).

Then the points in the ring are given by going from
  Segment 0 (indices 0 to n–1): P₀ + k·d₀,
  Segment 1 (indices n to 2n–1): [P₀ + n·d₀] + k·d₁,
  Segment 2 (indices 2n to 3n–1): [P₀ + n·d₀ + n·d₁] + k·d₂,
  … and so on.
If we call the index “k” along the ring (with 0 ≤ k ≤ 6n–1) then the spiral–number corresponding to a point on ring n is

  number = {3(n–1)n + 1} + (index + 1).

For example, in ring 26 the first number is 1952 and the “starting point” is P₀ = (26, 0).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Locating 2026

Since 2026 is in ring 26, let
  k₀ = 2026 – 1952 = 74    (with indices counted from 0).
Because each side of ring 26 has 26 points, the segments are:
  Segment 0: indices 0 to 25,
  Segment 1: indices 26 to 51,
  Segment 2: indices 52 to 77,
  …
Thus k₀ = 74 falls in Segment 2. In Segment 2 the points are given by
  (0, –26) + k·d₂   with d₂ = (–1, 1).
Taking k = 74 – 52 = 22 gives
  (0, –26) + 22·(–1, 1) = (–22, –4).
Thus the cell holding 2026 is at axial coordinate (–22, –4).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Finding its 6 neighbors

A cell in a hexagonal grid has the six neighbors obtained by adding the above d₀,…, d₅. Thus the six neighbor–coordinates of (–22, –4) are:
  A = (–22, –4) + d₀ = (–22, –5),
  B = (–22, –4) + d₁ = (–23, –4),
  C = (–22, –4) + d₂ = (–23, –3),
  D = (–22, –4) + d₃ = (–22, –3),
  E = (–22, –4) + d₄ = (–21, –4),
  F = (–22, –4) + d₅ = (–21, –5).

One then computes the “ring” of each neighbor using
  n = max ( |q|, |r|, |q + r| ).
A short check shows that:
  – Neighbors C and F lie in ring 26.
  – Neighbors D and E lie in ring 25.
  – Neighbors A and B lie in ring 27.

We now “invert” the spiral formula to determine the number in each cell.

For a cell in ring n the number is given by
  number = {3(n–1)n + 1} + (index + 1),
where “index” is the counterclockwise step–number in that ring (with the starting point at (n,0) having index 0).

Let’s do them case–by–case.

1. Neighbors in Ring 26

For ring 26 the base is 3·25·26 + 1 = 1950 + 1 = 1951.
 a. Neighbor C at (–23, –3):
  On ring 26 points in Segment 2 have the form (–k, –26 + k). Setting (–k, –26+k) = (–23, –3) gives k = 23.
  Its index is 2·26 + 23 = 52 + 23 = 75.
  So its number is 1951 + (75 + 1) = 1951 + 76 = 2027.
 b. Neighbor F at (–21, –5):
  We require (–k, –26+k) = (–21, –5). This yields k = 21.
  Then its index = 52 + 21 = 73.
  Number = 1951 + 73 + 1 = 1951 + 74 = 2025.

2. Neighbors in Ring 25

For ring 25 the base is 3·24·25 + 1 = 1800 + 1 = 1801.
 a. Neighbor D at (–22, –3):
  On ring 25, Segment 2 has points (–k, –25+k). Setting (–k, –25+k) = (–22, –3) yields k = 22.
  Index = 2·25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72.
  Number = 1801 + 72 + 1 = 1801 + 73 = 1874.
 b. Neighbor E at (–21, –4):
  Solve (–k, –25+k) = (–21, –4) giving k = 21.
  Index = 50 + 21 = 71.
  Number = 1801 + 71 + 1 = 1801 + 72 = 1873.

3. Neighbors in Ring 27

For ring 27 the base is 3·26·27 + 1 = 2106 + 1 = 2107 for the last number of ring 27, so the first number in ring 27 is
  2107 – (6·27 – 1) = 2107 – 161 = 2107 – 161? 
But it is easier to use the complementary formula. In fact, the numbers in ring n run from 3(n–1)n + 2 up to 3n(n+1) + 1. Thus for ring 27 the first number is 3·26·27 + 2 = 2106 + 2 = 2108.
 a. Neighbor A at (–22, –5):
  In ring 27, points in Segment 2 are given by (–k, –27+k). Setting (–k, –27+k) = (–22, –5) forces k = 22.
  Index = 2·27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76.
  Number = 2108 + 76 = 2184.
 b. Neighbor B at (–23, –4):
  Solve (–k, –27+k) = (–23, –4) giving k = 23.
  Index = 54 + 23 = 77.
  Number = 2108 + 77 = 2185.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Summing the 6 neighbors

The six neighbors of 2026 have been found to be the numbers:
  2184, 2185, 2027, 2025, 1874, 1873.
Their sum is:
  2184 + 2185 = 4369,
  2027 + 2025 = 4052,
  1874 + 1873 = 3747.
Then 4369 + 4052 = 8421, and 8421 + 3747 = 12168.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion

The sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

(Note. Although the “coordinate approach” may seem long, it is one systematic way to “locate” any number in the spiral and then compute the numbers in neighboring cells.)
