We will show that, when the numbers are “spun‐out” on a hexagon as in

  … 14 4 3 10 …
  15 5 1 2 9 …
  … 16 6 7 8 … 

then the six numbers immediately surrounding 2026 sum to 12 166.

In what follows we describe one way to “locate” 2026 and its six neighbors and then “read off” their labels. (There are several ways to do this; one may use “axial” or “cube” coordinates on a hexagonal grid.) 

──────────────────────────────
A little background

A “hex‐spiral” is created by writing 1 in the centre and then “circling” 1 by rings. (One common convention is that the six numbers immediately around 1 are 2,…,7.) In fact the n‑th ring (n ≥ 1) contains 6n numbers so that the greatest number in ring n is
  1 + 6 + 12 + … + 6n = 1 + 3n(n + 1).
Thus, 1 is in “ring 0”, ring 1 holds 2,…,7, ring 2 holds 8,…,19, and so on.

For our purposes one may show that the first number in ring n is
  N₍first₎ = 1 + 3(n – 1)n + 1,
so that, for example, ring 25 has numbers 1801 through 1951 and ring 26 has numbers 1952 through 2107.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Find the Ring of 2026

We want 2026. Since the total numbers up to ring r equal 1 + 3r(r + 1), we need r such that
  1 + 3r(r + 1) ≥ 2026.
A little calculation shows that r = 26 is the unique choice (since
  1 + 3·25·26 = 1951  and  1 + 3·26·27 = 2107).
Thus 2026 is found in ring 26. Its “ring–index” (position along the ring) is

  k = 2026 – (number of numbers up to ring 25) = 2026 – 1951 = 75.
(If one “numbers” a ring starting at index 0 then 2026 is at index 74.)

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Setting Up a Coordinate System

One very natural coordinate system for a hexagonal grid is “cube‐coordinates.” (There are many equivalent systems.) In one standard choice one puts the center (the 1–cell) at (0, 0, 0) and declares the six neighbors to be

  d₀ = (1, –1, 0)
  d₁ = (1, 0, –1)
  d₂ = (0, 1, –1)
  d₃ = (–1, 1, 0)
  d₄ = (–1, 0, 1)
  d₅ = (0, –1, 1).

In our spiral the natural “walking order” is as follows. The first ring is “traced” by starting at
  A₀ = (1, –1, 0)  (which we call 2)
and then taking one step at a time in the directions d₀, d₁, …, d₅ cyclically. One may check that the six numbers in the first ring come out as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For higher rings one uses the same idea – the n‑th ring (with n ≥ 1) has 6n numbers and its “first” cell is chosen to be
  A₀ = (n, –n, 0),
which then “runs” around by taking n steps in each of the six directions
  d₀ = (0, 1, –1),
  d₁ = (–1, 1, 0),
  d₂ = (–1, 0, 1),
  d₃ = (0, –1, 1),
  d₄ = (1, –1, 0),
  d₅ = (1, 0, –1).
One may show that with this convention the starting number of ring n is indeed
  1 + 3(n – 1)n + 1,
and that the numbers go in “order” as required.

For example, for ring 26 the starting point is

  A₀ = (26, –26, 0)  (assigned number 1952).

Then the ring is “traced” by going 26 steps in direction d₀ to produce the first segment, then 26 steps in direction d₁, etc. (Thus each “segment” has 26 numbers, and 2026 – being the 75th number in ring 26 – falls in the third segment.)

By a short calculation one obtains that 2026 sits at

  P = (–22, 26, –4).
(In cube–coordinates one always has x + y + z = 0; here –22 + 26 – 4 = 0.)

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Locating the Six Neighbors of 2026

Its six adjacent hexagons are given by adding the six unit steps d₀,…,d₅ to P. In our coordinate system the neighbors are:

  N₀ = P + (1, –1,  0) = (–21, 25, –4),
  N₁ = P + (1,  0, –1) = (–21, 26, –5),
  N₂ = P + (0,  1, –1) = (–22, 27, –5),
  N₃ = P + (–1, 1,  0) = (–23, 27, –4),
  N₄ = P + (–1, 0,  1) = (–23, 26, –3),
  N₅ = P + (0, –1, 1) = (–22, 25, –3).

A short check shows that the “ring–number” (that is, the distance from the centre) of these six cells is not all the same:
 • Two of the neighbors lie in ring 25,
 • Two in ring 26,
 • And two in ring 27.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Reading the Spiral Number at a Given Coordinate

There is a known method to “recover” the spiral number from the cube–coordinate when the cell lies on the outer “ring” (its distance from the centre is r > 0).

For a given ring r the numbers run from
  N_start = 1 + 3(r – 1)r + 1     to     1 + 3r(r + 1).
Furthermore, the r–ring is “divided” evenly into 6 segments (each with r cells). By “locating” the given cube–coordinate on the correct segment and figuring out its offset there, one recovers its spiral number.

Below we summarize the computation for each neighbor.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₀ = (–21, 25, –4):

This cell lies on ring 25 (since max(|–21|,|25|,|–4|) = 25). For ring 25 the first number is

  1801 = 1 + 3·24·25 + 1.
A little thought shows that N₀ (which has y = 25) lies on the “third segment” (segment number 2 counting from 0). In fact one may show that the points on that segment have the form

  (0 – t, 25, –25 + t)  with 0 ≤ t ≤ 25.
Here t = 21 (since –t = –21 and –25 + 21 = –4), so the index within ring 25 is

  index = 2·25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71.
Thus the number at N₀ is 1801 + 71 = 1872.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₅ = (–22, 25, –3):

Also on ring 25. (Here one finds t = 22 on the same “third segment”, so index = 50 + 22 = 72.)
Thus its number is 1801 + 72 = 1873.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₁ = (–21, 26, –5):

This lies on ring 26. (For ring 26 the first number is 1952.) Its coordinates show (with y = 26) that it lies on the third segment (points of the form (0 – t, 26, –26 + t)). Here t = 21 so the index is

  2·26 + 21 = 52 + 21 = 73.
Thus its number is 1952 + 73 = 2025.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₄ = (–23, 26, –3):

Also on ring 26 and on the same segment. Now t = 23 so index = 52 + 23 = 75.
Its number is 1952 + 75 = 2027.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₂ = (–22, 27, –5):

This one is in ring 27 (first number in ring 27 is 2108, since numbers up to ring 26 run up to 2107). Its coordinates (with y = 27) show that it lies on the analogous “third segment” there. Writing that segment as (0 – t, 27, –27 + t), we get t = 22, so index = 2·27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76.
Thus its number is 2108 + 76 = 2184.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor N₃ = (–23, 27, –4):

Also in ring 27; here t = 23 so index = 54 + 23 = 77.
Its number is 2108 + 77 = 2185.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Summing the Six Neighboring Numbers

We have obtained:
 N₀ → 1872
 N₅ → 1873
 N₁ → 2025
 N₄ → 2027
 N₂ → 2184
 N₃ → 2185

Adding them we get:
 1872 + 1873 = 3745,
 2025 + 2027 = 4052,
 2184 + 2185 = 4369,
and so
 3745 + 4052 = 7797,   7797 + 4369 = 12,166.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The six neighbors of the number 2026 have labels 1872, 1873, 2025, 2027, 2184, and 2185; their sum is 12,166.

Thus, the answer is 12,166.
