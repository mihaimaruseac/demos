We will show that in the spiral arrangement

   … 14 4 3 10 …  
   … 15 5 1 2 9 …  
   … 16 6 7 8 …  

the “six‐neighbors” of the number 2026 add up to 12168.

In what follows we briefly explain one way to “derive” this number. (Any correct method is acceptable.)

──────────────────────────────
A “coordinate‐model” for the spiral

One very natural way of “labeling” this hexagonal spiral is to identify the cells with points (or “cubes”) in a hexagonal coordinate system. For example, one may describe a hexagon (with center “1”) by “cube‐coordinates”

  ( x, y, z )  with x + y + z = 0.

A very common choice is to take
  • 1 at (0, 0, 0)
  • 2 at (1, –1, 0)
  • 3 at (1, 0, –1)
  • 4 at (0, 1, –1)
  • 5 at (–1, 1, 0)
  • 6 at (–1, 0, 1)
  • 7 at (0, –1, 1).

Then the spiral “rings” are concentric: ring r (r ≥ 1) has exactly 6r cells and consists exactly of those coordinates with “distance” r, where
  r = max(|x|, |y|, |z|).

It turns out that if one arranges the natural numbers “in spiral‐order” (starting with 1 at the center and then going counterclockwise around the rings) then one may show that every cell in ring r (r ≥ 1) gets the number

  N = (first number of ring r) + k  with 0 ≤ k ≤ 6r – 1,
  where the “first number” is
    N₀(r) = 3r² – 3r + 2.

(For example, ring 1 has first number 3·1² – 3·1 + 2 = 2 and the six numbers 2, …, 7; ring 26 has first number 3·26² – 3·26 + 2 = 1952, and so numbers 1952, 1953, …, 2107 appear in ring 26.)

Moreover, by a suitable “parametrization” of the ring (dividing it into 6 segments of equal length r) one may “recover” the cube‐coordinate of each number. In our treatment we assume that the numbering has been arranged so that the “starting point” in ring r is

  S = (r, –r, 0)
    (which for r = 1 is (1, –1, 0) – corresponding to 2).

Locating 2026 and its neighbors

A short calculation shows that 2026 lies in ring 26. (Indeed, since the total number of cells through ring r is 1 + 3r(r + 1), one finds that ring 25 contains 1951 cells and ring 26 the numbers 1952–2107.) In fact, one obtains

  2026 = 1952 + 74.

A “parametric” description of ring 26 (with 156 cells) shows that the cell numbered 2026 has cube‐coordinate

  P = (–22, 26, –4).

Its six neighbors are given by adding the “fundamental” vectors

  a₀ = ( 1, –1,  0)   (an “east” step)
  a₁ = ( 1,  0, –1)
  a₂ = ( 0,  1, –1)
  a₃ = (–1,  1,  0)
  a₄ = (–1,  0,  1)
  a₅ = ( 0, –1,  1)
to P. In other words, the neighbor in the “east‐direction” is

  P + a₀ = (–21, 25, –4),

etc.

A (fairly lengthy) calculation shows that the six neighbors lie in one of the rings 25, 26, or 27. One may “invert” the spiral–formula (i.e. determine the ring and “offset” on the ring from the cube–coordinate) to verify that their corresponding numbers are

  N₀ = 1873 (in ring 25),
  N₁ = 2025 (in ring 26),
  N₂ = 2184 (in ring 27),
  N₃ = 2185 (in ring 27),
  N₄ = 2027 (in ring 26),
  N₅ = 1874 (in ring 25).

One easily checks that indeed

  1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.

Conclusion

Thus, using one acceptable model for the hexagonal spiral the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 is 12168.

Final Answer: 12168.

Any method that correctly “locates” 2026 and its adjacent cells and then expresses their numbers in closed‐form will of course be acceptable.
