We will show that if we “draw” the numbers on a hex‐spiral – putting 1 in the center and “winding” out in rings – then the six numbers touching the cell that eventually holds 2026 add up to 12168.

In what follows we describe one way to “locate” 2026 and then “read off” the six numbers that border it. (There are several solutions; we outline one.)

───────────────────────────── 
A Hexagonal Spiral “Model”

One very natural way to “spiral–number” a hexagonal grid is as follows. Place 1 at the center. Then arrange the natural numbers in “rings” so that the numbers on the first ring around 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (in order around 1). In general, the n‑th ring (n ≥ 1) has 6n cells. One may show that the total number of cells in rings 0 through n is

  1 + 6(1 + 2 + … + n) = 1 + 3n(n + 1).

Thus the maximum number on ring n is 
  1 + 3n(n + 1)
and (for n ≥ 1) the numbers on ring n run consecutively from 
  A(n) = 3(n – 1)n + 2     to   1 + 3n(n + 1).

A “standard” coordinate system for the hexagonal grid is the axial one. (If you are familiar with “cube‐coordinates,” that works equally well.) In axial coordinates we assign the center (with 1) the coordinate (0, 0) and declare the six “neighbors” to be obtained by adding one of the six vectors

  (1, 0), (1, –1), (0, –1), (–1, 0), (–1, 1), (0, 1).

In our spiral it turns out that we may choose the first cell of ring n to be placed at (n, 0). Then the n cells on each of the six “sides” are obtained sequentially (in counter‐clockwise order) by “stepping” in the direction given below. For convenience we define six “side–step” vectors:
  d₀ = (0, –1)
  d₁ = (–1, 0)
  d₂ = (–1, 1)
  d₃ = (0, 1)
  d₄ = (1, 0)
  d₅ = (1, –1).

Thus any cell on ring n can be written uniquely in the form

  (n, 0) + [for some side s (with 0 ≤ s ≤ 5) add the full side–steps s · n] + (t dₛ)
   with 0 ≤ t ≤ n – 1.
Its “offset” (0–indexed) along the ring is then

  index = s · n + t.

Finally, the spiral number in that cell is

  number = A(n) + (s·n + t).

───────────────────────────── 
Locating 2026

We first ask: In which ring does 2026 lie? Since the maximum number on ring n is

  1 + 3n(n + 1),
we need the smallest n with
  1 + 3n(n + 1) ≥ 2026.

A little algebra shows that n = 26 works (in fact, ring 25 ends with 1 + 3·25·26 = 1951, so ring 26 begins with 1952 and ends with 2107).

Now, the first number on ring 26 is

  A(26) = 3·25·26 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952.
So the “offset” (0–indexed) of 2026 in ring 26 is

  2026 – 1952 = 74.

Since ring 26 has 6·26 = 156 numbers and its cells are broken into 6 sides of 26 cells each, writing 74 = (2 × 26) + 22 shows that 2026 is on side s = 2 with t = 22.

Thus its axial coordinates are computed as follows:
1. Start at the “first cell” of ring 26: (26, 0).
2. Then add the full displacements for sides 0 and 1:
  Side 0 adds: 26 · d₀ = 26 · (0, –1) = (0, –26).
  Side 1 adds: 26 · d₁ = 26 · (–1, 0) = (–26, 0).
  So after 2 sides the position is (26, 0) + (0, –26) + (–26, 0) = (0, –26).
3. Then add t = 22 steps in direction d₂ = (–1, 1):
  22 · d₂ = (–22, 22).
4. Hence the coordinates of 2026 are
  (0 – 22, –26 + 22) = (–22, –4).

───────────────────────────── 
Finding the Neighbors of 2026

In the axial system the six neighbors of any cell at (q, r) are
  (q + 1, r), (q + 1, r – 1), (q, r – 1), (q – 1, r), (q – 1, r + 1), (q, r + 1).
Thus the six neighbors of (–22, –4) are:
  N₁: (–21, –4)
  N₂: (–21, –5)
  N₃: (–22, –5)
  N₄: (–23, –4)
  N₅: (–23, –3)
  N₆: (–22, –3).

Each of these lies on one of the “rings” of the spiral. (One may check by converting to cube–coordinates that their “ring numbers” are as follows: N₁ and N₆ lie in ring 25, N₂ and N₅ in ring 26, and N₃ and N₄ in ring 27.) We now “reverse–engineer” the spiral number at each coordinate.

For a cell on ring m the number is given by

  number = A(m) + [offset computed as follows],
with A(m) = 3(m – 1)m + 2.

The method is, given the cell’s axial coordinates (q, r), first “recognize” on which of the 6 sides it lies and then solve for the parameters s and t in
  (q, r) = (m, 0) + [for i = 0 to s – 1 add m·dᵢ] + t·dₛ.
Below we list one acceptable solution for each neighbor.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₁: (–21, –4)

It turns out that (–21, –4) lies in ring 25. (You can verify that the “range” shows m = 25.) In ring 25 we have:
  A(25) = 3·24·25 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802.
A short search shows that (–21, –4) is obtained on side s = 2. In particular, on side 2 the points are
  (0, –25) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –25 + t).
Setting –t = –21 gives t = 21; then –25 + 21 = –4.
The offset on ring 25 is then s·25 + t = 2·25 + 21 = 71.
Thus N₁ has number 1802 + 71 = 1873.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₂: (–21, –5)

Here the point lies on ring 26. (A quick check gives m = 26, since A(26) = 1952.)
On side s = 2 we have the points
  (0, –26) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –26 + t).
For (–21, –5) we get t = 21 (since –t = –21, and –26+21 = –5).
The offset = 2·26 + 21 = 52 + 21 = 73.
So N₂ has number 1952 + 73 = 2025.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₃: (–22, –5)

This cell lies on ring 27. For ring 27:
  A(27) = 3·26·27 + 2 = 2106 + 2 = 2108.
On side s = 2, the points are
  (0, –27) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –27 + t).
Setting –t = –22 gives t = 22, and –27+22 = –5.
The offset is 2·27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76.
Thus N₃ has number 2108 + 76 = 2184.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₄: (–23, –4)

Also in ring 27, we find on side s = 2 the representation
  (0, –27) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –27 + t).
Setting –t = –23 gives t = 23; then –27+23 = –4.
Offset = 2·27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77.
Thus N₄ has number 2108 + 77 = 2185.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₅: (–23, –3)

This one lies in ring 26. On side s = 2 we have (for ring 26)
  (0, –26) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –26 + t).
Here –t = –23 gives t = 23, and –26+23 = –3.
Offset = 2·26 + 23 = 52 + 23 = 75.
So N₅ gets the number 1952 + 75 = 2027.

───────────────────────────── 
Neighbor N₆: (–22, –3)

Finally, this one is in ring 25. Again on side s = 2 for ring 25,
  (0, –25) + t·(–1, 1) = (–t, –25 + t),
we set –t = –22 so t = 22 and –25+22 = –3.
Offset = 2·25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72.
Thus N₆ gets the number 1802 + 72 = 1874.

───────────────────────────── 
Summing the Six Neighbors

We have found:
  N₁ = 1873
  N₂ = 2025
  N₃ = 2184
  N₄ = 2185
  N₅ = 2027
  N₆ = 1874

Their sum is

  1873 + 2025 = 3898,
  2184 + 2185 = 4369,
  2027 + 1874 = 3901.
Adding: 3898 + 4369 + 3901 = 12168.

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion

Thus, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is 12168.
