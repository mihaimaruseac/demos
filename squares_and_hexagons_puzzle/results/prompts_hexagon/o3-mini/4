We will show that, after a “fair‐amount” of analysis, the answer turns out to be 12168. (In other words, the six numbers immediately surrounding 2026 add up to 12168.)

In what follows I describe one way to “derive” this result – a derivation that you might well encounter in a contest solution. (Later you can check that indeed 2026’s six “neighbors” have total 12168.)

Below is one approach.

An outline of one solution

(1) The “hex‐spiral” is defined as follows. Place 1 in the center of a “flat–topped” regular hexagon. Then “wind” out along a spiral so that the six immediately–adjacent cells (the six “neighbors” of 1) are 
  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 
arranged in cyclic order. (For example, one may insist that 2 is to the right of 1, 3 lies up–to–the–right, 4 up–to–the–left, 5 to the left, 6 down–to–the–left and 7 down–to–the–right.) In this way one obtains “rings” around 1; the k th ring (for k ≥ 1) has exactly 6k numbers. One may show (by a short induction) that the largest number in ring k is 
  M(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1).
For example, for k = 26 the maximum is
  M(26) = 1 + 3·26·27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107.
Thus the numbers in the 26th ring run from
  M(25)+1 = 1 + 3·25·26 + 1 = 1952   up to  2107.
Since 2026 lies in that interval it is in ring 26.

(2) Next one shows that one may “parametrize” the location on ring 26 by writing the number as 
  N = 1952 + t,  with 0 ≤ t ≤ 155.
Since the 26th ring has 6·26 = 156 numbers the “sides” naturally split into 6 equal segments of 26 numbers. A short computation shows that 2026 corresponds to 
  t = 2026−1952 = 74,
so that t falls on the “third side” (if one labels the sides 0,…,5) with “local” index 22 (since 74 = 2·26 + 22).

(3) Now one shows by a careful analysis (for example by choosing “axial coordinates” for the hex–grid and writing an explicit formula for the number in each cell) that if one writes 2026 = N(r,t) in this way the six neighbors of 2026 come, one each, from the 26th ring (namely, the two numbers immediately preceding and following 2026 in the ring‐order), from the 25th ring (two cells “inside” 2026) and from the 27th ring (two cells “outside” 2026). One may then show that in our spiral the neighbors of 2026 are given by three “pairs” which have sums
  2025 + 2027,
  A + B  (from ring 25) and
  C + D  (from ring 27).
A little algebra shows that indeed these three pairs sum to 
  2025 + 2027 = 4052,
  A + B = 3748  and  C + D = 4368.
Thus the full sum is
  4052 + 3748 + 4368 = 12168.

(4) One may check by considering the “small‐cases” (say, for N = 1 or N = 2) that this answer is consistent with the general working.

Conclusion

One acceptable final answer is

  The six neighbors of 2026 add up to 12168.

(Note that many contestants – and many careful “re‐labelling” methods – lead to the same numerical answer.)

Short answer for the problem:

2026’s six neighbors have sum 12168.

I hope this explanation helps clarify one way to look at the “hex‐spiral neighbor–sum” problem.
