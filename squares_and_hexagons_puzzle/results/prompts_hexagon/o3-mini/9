We will show that, when the numbers are “spiralled” onto a regular hex‐grid (with center 1 and the six “first‐ring” numbers 2,…,7 arranged in clockwise order so that 
  2 = east, 3 = north‐east, 4 = north‐west, 5 = west, 6 = south‐west, 7 = south‐east),
then the “cell” numbered 2026 (which lies on “ring 26”) has its six adjacent numbers (its “neighbors”) having sum 12,192.

In what follows we describe – briefly – one way to “translate” the problem into coordinates and then “invert” the labelling. (Any correct method is acceptable!)

───────────────────────────── 
A. Setting up the hex–spiral

1. Coordinate system.
We use “axial” coordinates (q,r) as customary for “pointy‐topped” hexagons. Choose the centre 1 to lie at (0,0). Its six neighbors are then:
  East: (1,0)
  North‐east: (1,–1)
  North‐west: (0,–1)
  West: (–1,0)
  South–west: (–1,1)
  South–east: (0,1).
Thus the first “ring” gets labelled (in clockwise order starting with 2 at east) as follows:
  2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,–1), 4 at (0,–1), 5 at (–1,0), 6 at (–1,1), 7 at (0,1).

2. Spiralling the numbers.
One finds that if you “wrap” around 1, then ring n (n ≥ 1) contains exactly 6n numbers. In fact the total count up through ring n is
  1 + 6 + 12 + … + 6n = 1 + 3n(n+1).
Moreover, a standard method for “tracing” the ring is as follows. In ring n choose the “starting cell” to be at
  V₀ = (n,0)
(which for n = 1 is (1,0) where the number 2 is placed). Then moving clockwise the ring is “traced” by six segments of n steps each with step‐directions
  d₀ = (0,–1),
  d₁ = (–1,0),
  d₂ = (–1,1),
  d₃ = (0,1),
  d₄ = (1,0),
  d₅ = (1,–1).
That is, an arbitrary cell on ring n is, for an appropriate integer 0 ≤ p < 6n, given by
  V(p) = V₀ + (number of steps along d₀, then d₁, …)
with the following “segment–breakdown”: the first n cells (p = 0,…, n–1) come from d₀, the next n from d₁, etc.
Also, one may show that the first number on ring n is
  first(n) = [1 + 3(n–1)n] + 1 = 3n(n–1) + 2.
For example, for n = 26 the first number is 3·26·25 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952 and ring 26 has 156 cells (from 1952 to 2107). 

───────────────────────────── 
B. Locating 2026 and Its Neighbors

1. Find the ring and position of 2026.
Since 
  total up through ring 25 = 1 + 3·25·26 = 1951  and  total up through ring 26 = 2107,
the number 2026 lies in ring 26. Its “offset” within that ring (counting from 0) is 2026 – 1952 = 74 (if we number the cells of ring 26 from 0 to 155). (An equivalent 1–based offset is 75.) 

A short calculation (using the segmentation described above) shows that 2026 comes on the third segment (the one whose steps are in the d₂ direction = (–1,1)). One finds that in fact
  2026 sits at axial coordinate (–22, –4).
(One way to verify this is to “reverse‐engineer” the spiral. In our coordinate system the six “vertices” of ring n are
  V₀ = (n,0),
  V₁ = (n,–n),
  V₂ = (0,–n),
  V₃ = (–n,0),
  V₄ = (–n,n),
  V₅ = (0,n).
For ring 26 these are (26,0), (26,–26), (0,–26), (–26,0), (–26,26), and (0,26). Working through the three segments using d₀ = (0,–1), d₁ = (–1,0) and d₂ = (–1,1) shows that 2026 lands at (–22, –4) – which indeed lies in ring 26.)

2. The Neighbor Cells.
In a hex‐grid a cell has 6 neighbors. In our axial coordinates these are obtained simply by adding the vectors corresponding to the 6 “directions.” Thus the 6 neighbors of (–22, –4) are the cells at:
  A: (–22, –4) + (1,0) = (–21, –4)
  B: (–22, –4) + (0,–1) = (–22, –5)
  C: (–22, –4) + (–1,–1) = (–23, –5)
  D: (–22, –4) + (–1,0) = (–23, –4)
  E: (–22, –4) + (0,1) = (–22, –3)
  F: (–22, –4) + (1,1) = (–21, –3).

For each such neighbor the spiral–labelling gives its number by two ingredients:
 (1) Its “ring” index – namely, for a point (q,r) the ring is n = max(|q|, |r|, |–q–r|).
 (2) Its “offset” p along that ring. One may show (by writing the given coordinates in “edge–form”) that if the neighbor lies on the edge joining Vᵢ to Vᵢ₊₁ (of ring n) and it is, say, a steps from the first vertex Vᵢ, then its offset p = i·n + a.
Then its number is
  first(n) + p  with first(n) = 3n(n–1) + 2.

A (Neighbor A at (–21, –4)):
 Compute its cube–coordinates:
  x = –21, r = –4, y = –(–21) – (–4) = 25.
 So its ring is n = max(21, 4, 25) = 25.
One shows that (–21, –4) lies on the edge joining
  V₂ = (0, –25)  and  V₃ = (–25, 0)
of ring 25. A short check shows it is 21 steps from V₂.
Thus, its offset = 2·25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71.
Now first(25) = 3·25·24 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802.
So its number is 1802 + 71 = 1873.

B (Neighbor B at (–22, –5)):
 Here, |–22| = 22, |–5| = 5, and |–(–22)–(–5)| = 22+5 = 27, so n = 27.
It lies (again) on the edge between V₂ and V₃ of ring 27. A short computation shows it is 22 steps from V₂.
Offset = 2·27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76.
first(27) = 3·27·26 + 2 = 2106 + 2 = 2108.
Number = 2108 + 76 = 2184.

C (Neighbor C at (–23, –5)):
 Here, |–23| = 23, |–5| = 5, and |23+5| = 28, so n = 28.
On ring 28 the corresponding edge (again V₂→V₃) gives a step–distance of 23 from V₂.
Offset = 2·28 + 23 = 56 + 23 = 79.
first(28) = 3·28·27 + 2 = 2268 + 2 = 2270.
Number = 2270 + 79 = 2349.

D (Neighbor D at (–23, –4)):
 Here, |–23| = 23, |–4| = 4, and |23+4| = 27, so n = 27.
On ring 27 and on the same edge (V₂→V₃) it is 23 steps from V₂.
Offset = 2·27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77.
Number = first(27) + 77 = 2108 + 77 = 2185.

E (Neighbor E at (–22, –3)):
 Here, |–22| = 22, |–3| = 3, and |22+3| = 25, so n = 25.
On ring 25, again along the edge from V₂ to V₃, one computes the step–distance as 22.
Offset = 2·25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72.
Number = 1802 + 72 = 1874.

F (Neighbor F at (–21, –3)):
 Here, |–21| = 21, |–3| = 3, and |21+3| = 24, so n = 24.
On ring 24 the same procedure (with edge V₂→V₃) gives a step–distance of 21.
Offset = 2·24 + 21 = 48 + 21 = 69.
first(24) = 3·24·23 + 2 = 1656 + 2 = 1658.
Number = 1658 + 69 = 1727.

───────────────────────────── 
C. Adding the Neighbors

Now the six neighbor numbers are:
 A: 1873
 B: 2184
 C: 2349
 D: 2185
 E: 1874
 F: 1727

Their sum is:
 1873 + 2184 = 4057  
 4057 + 2349 = 6406  
 6406 + 2185 = 8591  
 8591 + 1874 = 10465  
 10465 + 1727 = 12192.

───────────────────────────── 
Answer

Thus the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is 12,192.

Any correct solution that “maps” the spiral to coordinates and then “inverts” to the spiral numbering is acceptable. 

The final answer is 12192.
