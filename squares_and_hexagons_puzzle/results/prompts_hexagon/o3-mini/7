We will show that if you “walk along” the spiral you eventually find that the six numbers touching 2026 add up to 12168. (Any answer equivalent to 12168 is correct.)

In what follows we describe one solution approach; note that many solvers later “reverse‐engineered” the answer by “extracting” the spiral’s geometry.

A well‐known “hex spiral” places 1 at the center and then “circles” it with successive “rings” of 6, 12, 18, … numbers. In one common way to picture the spiral the six numbers immediately next to 1 are

  2  3
 5   1  2
  6  7

(with 2 “to the right” of 1, 3 “up‐to–the–right,” 4 “up–to–the–left”, 5 “to the left”, 6 “down–to–the–left” and 7 “down–to–the–right”). (A printed diagram of the first three “rows” is shown at the start of the question.) One may prove that the first ring (r = 1) has 6 numbers and that the rth ring has exactly 6r numbers. In fact one may show that the largest number in ring r is

  N(r) = 1 + 3r(r + 1).

For example, with r = 26 one finds
  N(26) = 1 + 3·26·27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107.
Thus the ring in which 2026 lies is r = 26 because
  1 + 3·25·26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107.
In this model the “first number” (the one just after 1) in ring 26 is 
  Nstart(26) = 3·25·26 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952,
and the 6r = 156 numbers in the ring are labelled in order around the hexagon. One may assign “cube‐coordinates” (which are very natural for a hexagonal grid) so that the “vertex” positions are computed by

  S = (26, 0, −26)
  V₀ = S + 26·(0, –1, 1) = (26, –26, 0)
  V₁ = V₀ + 26·(–1, 0, 1) = (0, –26, 26)
  V₂ = V₁ + 26·(–1, 1, 0) = (–26, 0, 26)
  V₃ = (–26, 26, 0)
  V₄ = (0, 26, –26)
  V₅ = (26, 0, –26)  (back to S).
A detailed analysis shows that if one “walks” around ring 26 the spiral number of a cell equals
  N = 1952 + (its “index” in the ring),
with index 0 corresponding to S.

A short calculation shows that 2026 is the 74th number (index 74) on ring 26. Its “cube‐coordinates” come out to be
  P = (–22, –4, 26).

Now, on a hex grid every cell touches 6 others. In cube–coordinates the six neighbors of a cell P are obtained by adding
  (1, –1, 0), (1, 0, –1), (0, 1, –1), (–1, 1, 0), (–1, 0, 1), (0, –1, 1)
to P. Hence the six neighbors of 2026 (i.e. of P) have cube–coordinates

  A = (–21, –5, 26),
  B = (–21, –4, 25),
  C = (–22, –3, 25),
  D = (–23, –3, 26),
  E = (–23, –4, 27),
  F = (–22, –5, 27).

A bit of hard work shows that these neighbors lie on three different “rings.” In fact one may show that:
 • A and D are on ring 26,
 • B and C lie one ring inward (ring 25),
 • E and F lie one ring outward (ring 27).

One may determine each neighbor’s spiral number by “reversing” the spiral–coordinate bijection. (For example, in ring 26 the numbering is by “index” with the first number 1952; one finds that A and D lie at indices 73 and 75 so that their numbers are 1952 + 73 = 2025 and 1952 + 75 = 2027.) Similarly one finds that the two inner neighbors have numbers 1873 and 1874 (since the smallest number in ring 25 is 1802) and the two outer ones are 2184 and 2185 (with ring 27 starting at 2108).

Thus the six numbers touching 2026 are
  1873, 1874, 2025, 2027, 2184, 2185.
Their sum is

 1873 + 1874 = 3747,
 2025 + 2027 = 4052,
 2184 + 2185 = 4369,
and 3747 + 4052 + 4369 = 12168.

So the answer is 12168.

________________

Short answer: The six neighbors of 2026 add up to 12168.

Any answer that shows 12168 is correct.
