The problem asks for the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid spiral.
First, we need to understand the spiral pattern and assign coordinates. Let's use axial coordinates (q, r) as defined by the spiral's movement.

Let 1 be at (0,0).
From the given diagram:
1.  **1 to 2**: East (E) - `(q+1, r)`
2.  **2 to 3**: North-East (NE) - `(q, r+1)`
3.  **3 to 4**: North-West (NW) - `(q-1, r+1)`
4.  **4 to 5**: West (W) - `(q-1, r)`
5.  **5 to 6**: South-West (SW) - `(q, r-1)`
6.  **6 to 7**: South-East (SE) - `(q+1, r-1)`

Let's trace the first few numbers and their coordinates using these moves:
*   1: (0,0)
*   2: (1,0) (E from 1)
*   3: (1,1) (NE from 2)
*   4: (0,2) (NW from 3)
*   5: (-1,2) (W from 4)
*   6: (-1,1) (SW from 5)
*   7: (0,0) (SE from 6) - **Problem: 7 is at (0,0) which is 1.** This means the spiral pattern is not a simple repeating sequence of steps.

Let's retry the coordinates based on the diagram directly:
1: (0,0)
2: (1,0) (E)
3: (1,1) (NE of 2)
4: (0,1) (NW of 3)
5: (-1,1) (W of 4)
6: (-1,0) (SW of 5)
7: (0,-1) (SE of 6)
This set of coordinates is consistent with the provided fragment. `N_1_max = 7` is at `(0,-1)`.

Now, let's identify the pattern for the last number in each ring, `N_k_max`.
*   `N_0_max = 1` at `(0,0)`
*   `N_1_max = 7` at `(0,-1)`
The `k`-th ring has `6k` numbers. The total number of cells up to ring `k` is `1 + 3k(k+1)`.
The spiral's path for ring `k` consists of 6 segments, each `k` steps long:
1.  E (k steps)
2.  NE (k steps)
3.  NW (k steps)
4.  W (k steps)
5.  SW (k steps)
6.  SE (k steps)

Let `(q_c, r_c)` be the coordinate of `N_{k-1}_max`.
*   Ring `k` starts at `N_{k-1}_max + 1`. This number is at `(q_c+1, r_c)`.
*   After `k` E steps, the position is `(q_c+k, r_c)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + k`.
*   After `k` NE steps, the position is `(q_c+k, r_c+k)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + 2k`.
*   After `k` NW steps, the position is `(q_c, r_c+k)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + 3k`.
*   After `k` W steps, the position is `(q_c-k, r_c+k)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + 4k`.
*   After `k` SW steps, the position is `(q_c-k, r_c)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + 5k`.
*   After `k` SE steps, the position is `(q_c, r_c-k)`. Number `N_{k-1}_max + 6k = N_k_max`.

Let's verify this for `N_k_max`:
*   `N_0_max = 1` at `(0,0)`.
*   `N_1_max = 7`. From `(0,0)`, after 1 SE step, we are at `(0,-1)`. Correct.
*   `N_2_max = 19`. From `N_1_max = 7` at `(0,-1)`. `k=2`.
    *   E (2 steps): `(0,-1)` to `(2,-1)`. (8, 9)
    *   NE (2 steps): `(2,-1)` to `(2,1)`. (10, 11)
    *   NW (2 steps): `(2,1)` to `(0,3)`. (12, 13)
    *   W (2 steps): `(0,3)` to `(-2,3)`. (14, 15)
    *   SW (2 steps): `(-2,3)` to `(-2,1)`. (16, 17)
    *   SE (2 steps): `(-2,1)` to `(0,-1)`. (18, 19). `N_2_max = 19` is at `(0,-1)`.
This is still problematic as 7 and 19 have the same coordinates. This indicates my coordinate mapping of directions or the segment start/end points are inconsistent with the spiral itself.

Let's use the given image pattern itself directly and focus on relative values.
The sum of neighbors of 1 is 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27.
The neighbors of 2 (at (1,0)) are 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 15 from the visual. Sum = 1+3+7+8+9+15 = 43.
This sum is not `6N` (12), not `6N+6k` (18), not `6N-6k` (6). So direct formulas are out.

We need to identify the exact coordinates of 2026 and its 6 neighbors, then find their values.

First, determine the ring `k` for 2026:
`N_k_max = 1 + 3k(k+1)`.
`3k(k+1) + 1 approx 2026`
`3k^2 approx 2025`
`k^2 approx 675`
`k = sqrt(675) approx 25.98`. So 2026 is in Ring 26.
`N_25_max = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
`N_26_max = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.
So 2026 is in Ring 26, from 1952 to 2107.

The starting point of Ring `k` `(N_{k-1}_max + 1)` is always next to `N_{k-1}_max` in the E direction.
The coordinate of `N_k_max` is `(k, -k)` for `k>=0`. Let's test this from the actual problem layout again:
1: (0,0) (N_0_max)
7: (0,-1) (N_1_max)
19: (0,-2) (N_2_max)
This pattern is `(0,-k)` for `N_k_max`.

Let's find the position of 2026 (`k=26`). `N_25_max = 1951` is at `(0,-25)`.
Ring 26 starts from `N_{25}_max + 1 = 1952`.
The spiral's path for Ring `k` starts from `(0, -(k-1))` for `N_{k-1}_max`.
1.  E (k steps): From `(0, -(k-1))` to `(k, -(k-1))`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+k`.
2.  NE (k steps): From `(k, -(k-1))` to `(k, 0)`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+k+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+2k`.
3.  NW (k steps): From `(k, 0)` to `(0, k)`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+2k+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+3k`.
4.  W (k steps): From `(0, k)` to `(-k, k)`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+3k+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+4k`.
5.  SW (k steps): From `(-k, k)` to `(-k, 0)`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+4k+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+5k`.
6.  SE (k steps): From `(-k, 0)` to `(0, -k)`. Numbers `N_{k-1}_max+5k+1` to `N_{k-1}_max+6k`. This is `N_k_max`.

For `k=26`, `N_{25}_max = 1951` is at `(0,-25)`.
Number `2026` is `2026 - 1951 = 75` steps into Ring 26.
Segments have length `k=26`.
*   Segment 1 (E): `1952` at `(1,-25)` to `1977` at `(26,-25)`. (26 steps)
*   Segment 2 (NE): `1978` at `(26,-24)` to `2003` at `(26,1)`. (26 steps)
*   Segment 3 (NW): `2004` at `(25,2)` to `2029` at `(0,27)`. (26 steps)
    *   2026 falls in this segment (`2004 <= 2026 <= 2029`).
    *   This segment starts at coordinate `(k-1, 1)` and ends at `(0,k)`.
    *   The `m`-th step from the start of the NW segment (starting from `m=0` for the first number, `2004`).
    *   `N = N_{25}_max + 2*26 + 1 + m = 1951 + 52 + 1 + m = 2004 + m`.
    *   For `N=2026`, `m = 2026 - 2004 = 22`.
    *   The coordinates for `N = 2004+m` are `(k-1-m, 1+m+1) = (k-1-m, m+2)`.
    *   So, for `m=22`, coordinates of 2026: `(26-1-22, 22+2) = (3, 24)`.
    *   So, 2026 is at `(Q,R) = (3,24)`.

Now, we find the 6 neighbors of `(3,24)`:
The 6 directions for (q,r) axial coordinates (consistent with the spiral mapping):
*   E: `(q+1, r)`
*   NE: `(q, r+1)`
*   NW: `(q-1, r+1)`
*   W: `(q-1, r)`
*   SW: `(q, r-1)`
*   SE: `(q+1, r-1)`

The neighbors of `(3,24)` are:
1.  **E**: `(3+1, 24) = (4,24)`.
    *   This is not on Ring 26's NW segment. We check Ring 27 (`k=27`).
    *   NW segment of Ring 27 starts from `N_{26}_max + 2*27 + 1 = 2107 + 54 + 1 = 2162`.
    *   This segment is `(k-1-m, m+2) = (26-m, m+2)`.
    *   For `(4,24)`, `m+2=24 => m=22`. `26-m = 26-22 = 4`. Matches!
    *   So, `(4,24)` is `2162 + 22 = 2184`.
2.  **NE**: `(3, 24+1) = (3,25)`.
    *   This is also in Ring 27.
    *   For `(3,25)`, `m+2=25 => m=23`. `26-m = 26-23 = 3`. Matches!
    *   So, `(3,25)` is `2162 + 23 = 2185`.
3.  **NW**: `(3-1, 24+1) = (2,25)`.
    *   This is the next number in the spiral path for 2026: `2026 + 1 = 2027`.
4.  **W**: `(3-1, 24) = (2,24)`.
    *   This is not on Ring 26's NW segment. Check Ring 25 (`k=25`).
    *   NW segment of Ring 25 starts from `N_{24}_max + 2*25 + 1 = 1801 + 50 + 1 = 1852`.
    *   This segment is `(k-1-m, m+2) = (24-m, m+2)`.
    *   For `(2,24)`, `m+2=24 => m=22`. `24-m = 24-22 = 2`. Matches!
    *   So, `(2,24)` is `1852 + 22 = 1874`.
5.  **SW**: `(3, 24-1) = (3,23)`.
    *   This is also in Ring 25.
    *   For `(3,23)`, `m+2=23 => m=21`. `24-m = 24-21 = 3`. Matches!
    *   So, `(3,23)` is `1852 + 21 = 1873`.
6.  **SE**: `(3+1, 24-1) = (4,23)`.
    *   This is the previous number in the spiral path for 2026: `2026 - 1 = 2025`.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
*   2184 (E)
*   2185 (NE)
*   2027 (NW)
*   1874 (W)
*   1873 (SW)
*   2025 (SE)

Sum of these neighbors:
`2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2025 = 12168`.

The final answer is $\boxed{12168}$.
