The problem asks for the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid spiral.

First, let's understand the structure of the spiral and identify the ring number for 2026.
The spiral starts from 1 at the center.
The k-th ring (starting with k=1 for the numbers 2-7) has 6k numbers.
The largest number in the k-th ring, N_k, is given by the sum of numbers in all preceding rings plus the center:
N_k = 1 + Σ(6i for i from 1 to k) = 1 + 6 * k * (k+1) / 2 = 1 + 3k(k+1).

Let's calculate N_k for a few values of k:
N_0 = 1 (the center)
N_1 = 1 + 3*1*2 = 7 (numbers 2-7)
N_2 = 1 + 3*2*3 = 19 (numbers 8-19)
N_3 = 1 + 3*3*4 = 37 (numbers 20-37)

Now, let's find the ring that contains 2026:
We need to find k such that N_{k-1} < 2026 <= N_k.
Approximate k(k+1) ~ 2026/3 ~ 675. sqrt(675) ~ 25.98. So k is around 25 or 26.
For k=25: N_25 = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951.
For k=26: N_26 = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107.
Since 1951 < 2026 <= 2107, the number 2026 is in the 26th ring (k=26).

Next, we need to locate 2026 within the 26th ring.
The 26th ring contains numbers from N_25+1 = 1952 to N_26 = 2107.
The number of elements in the 26th ring is 6*26 = 156.
The ring is composed of 6 segments, each of length k=26.
The segments are traversed in a specific order: Right (R), Up-Right (UR), Up-Left (UL), Left (L), Down-Left (DL), Down-Right (DR).

Let's find the segment 2026 belongs to:
Start of ring 26: 1952.
Offset of 2026 from the start of ring 26 = 2026 - 1952 = 74. (This is 0-indexed offset, meaning it's the 75th number in the ring).

Segment 1 (R): N_25 + 1 to N_25 + k = 1952 to 1951 + 26 = 1977 (offsets 0-25).
Segment 2 (UR): N_25 + k + 1 to N_25 + 2k = 1978 to 1951 + 52 = 2003 (offsets 26-51).
Segment 3 (UL): N_25 + 2k + 1 to N_25 + 3k = 2004 to 1951 + 78 = 2029 (offsets 52-77).

Since 2026 is at offset 74 (which is between 52 and 77), it is on the Up-Left (UL) segment of ring 26.
Its position within this segment is 74 - 52 = 22 (0-indexed) or 23rd (1-indexed).
Since 1 <= 23 <= 26, 2026 is an "internal" point on the UL segment, not at its very beginning or end. This simplifies finding its neighbors using general formulas.

The 6 neighbors of a number X on ring k (for k>1 and X not at a segment boundary):
1.  **X-1**: The previous number in the spiral.
2.  **X+1**: The next number in the spiral.
3.  **X - 6(k-1)**: The radially inward neighbor (on the same "spoke" as X, in ring k-1).
4.  **X + 6k**: The radially outward neighbor (on the same "spoke" as X, in ring k+1).
5.  **X - (6(k-1) + 1)**: A diagonally inward neighbor.
6.  **X + (6k + 1)**: A diagonally outward neighbor.

Let's calculate these values for X = 2026 and k = 26:
1.  2026 - 1 = **2025**
2.  2026 + 1 = **2027**
3.  2026 - 6*(26-1) = 2026 - 6*25 = 2026 - 150 = **1876**
4.  2026 + 6*26 = 2026 + 156 = **2182**
5.  2026 - (6*(26-1) + 1) = 2026 - (150 + 1) = 2026 - 151 = **1875**
6.  2026 + (6*26 + 1) = 2026 + (156 + 1) = 2026 + 157 = **2183**

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 1876, 2182, 1875, and 2183.
(Note: The choice of +1 for the last two diagonal neighbors is based on the orientation of the spiral for the UL segment. For a UL segment point, the diagonal neighbors connect to the *previous* segment in the inner ring (hence -1 offset) and the *next* segment in the outer ring (hence +1 offset)).

Finally, we sum these neighbors:
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1876 + 2182 + 1875 + 2183 = **12168**.

The final answer is $\boxed{12168}$.
