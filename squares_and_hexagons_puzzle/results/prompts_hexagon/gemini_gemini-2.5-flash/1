The problem describes a spiral of natural numbers on a hexagonal grid. Let's define a coordinate system for the hexagonal grid, often called axial coordinates (q, r).
Let the number 1 be at (0,0).
The 6 directions for neighbors are:
D0: (1,0) (East)
D1: (0,1) (North-East)
D2: (-1,1) (North-West)
D3: (-1,0) (West)
D4: (0,-1) (South-West)
D5: (1,-1) (South-East)

The spiral starts at 1, then moves one step in each of these 6 directions, forming the first layer (numbers 2-7). Then it moves two steps in each direction for the second layer (numbers 8-19), and so on.

Let `N_m` be the largest number in layer `m`. The number of cells in layer `m` is `6m`.
`N_0 = 1` (at (0,0))
`N_m = N_{m-1} + 6m = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^m 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 1 + 3m(m+1)`.

Let's trace the coordinates and values:
`N_0 = 1` at (0,0)

Layer 1 (m=1):
Starts from `N_0+1 = 2`.
1 step D0: 2 at (1,0)
1 step D1: 3 at (1,1)
1 step D2: 4 at (0,1)
1 step D3: 5 at (-1,1)
1 step D4: 6 at (-1,0)
1 step D5: 7 at (0,-1). This is `N_1`.

Layer `m`:
It starts from `N_{m-1}+1`.
The path starts from `(1,-m+1)` and goes `m` steps in D0, then `m` steps in D1, etc.
The coordinates of the end of each side (segment) are:
- Start of layer `m`: `N_{m-1}+1` at `(1,-m+1)`
- End of D0 (East segment): `N_{m-1}+m` at `(m,-m+1)`
- End of D1 (North-East segment): `N_{m-1}+2m` at `(m,1)` (No, from `(m,-m+1)` to `(m,-m+1) + m*(0,1) = (m,1)` if `-m+1+m = 1`)
- End of D2 (North-West segment): `N_{m-1}+3m` at `(0,m+1)` (No, from `(m,1)` to `(m,1) + m*(-1,1) = (0,m+1)`)
- End of D3 (West segment): `N_{m-1}+4m` at `(-m,m+1)`
- End of D4 (South-West segment): `N_{m-1}+5m` at `(-m,1)`
- End of D5 (South-East segment): `N_{m-1}+6m = N_m` at `(0,-m)`

Let's find the layer `m` for 2026.
`N_m \approx 2026`
`3m(m+1) \approx 2025`
`m^2 \approx 675`
`m \approx \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98`
So `m` should be 26.
`N_{25} = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
`N_{26} = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.
So, 2026 is in layer 26.

Let's find the coordinates of 2026.
Layer 26 starts with `N_{25}+1 = 1952`.
The starting position for layer 26 is `(1,-25)`.
Segments of length 26 steps:
1. D0 (East): `N_{25}+1` to `N_{25}+26 = 1952` to `1977`.
   Coords from `(1,-25)` to `(1,-25) + (26-1)*(1,0) = (26,-25)`. (No, start from 1, end at 26.
   `N_{25}+1` at `(1,-25)`. `N_{25}+26` at `(26,-25)`.
2. D1 (North-East): `N_{25}+27` to `N_{25}+26+26 = 2003`.
   Coords from `(26,-25)` to `(26,-25) + 26*(0,1) = (26,1)`.
3. D2 (North-West): `N_{25}+27+26 = 2004` to `N_{25}+26+26+26 = 2029`.
   Coords from `(26,1)` to `(26,1) + 26*(-1,1) = (0,27)`.

The number 2026 falls into the D2 segment (from 2004 to 2029).
The number 2004 is at `(26,1)`.
The step number for 2026 is `2026 - 2004 = 22`.
So the coordinates of 2026 are `(26,1) + 22*(-1,1) = (26-22, 1+22) = (4,23)`.

This is the location of 2026. Let's call it `P = (4,23)`.
We need the sum of its 6 neighbors. The neighbors of `(q,r)` are:
N1 = (q+1, r) = (5,23)
N2 = (q, r+1) = (4,24)
N3 = (q-1, r+1) = (3,24)
N4 = (q-1, r) = (3,23)
N5 = (q, r-1) = (4,22)
N6 = (q+1, r-1) = (5,22)

We know `P = (4,23)` is 2026. It is 22 steps into the D2 segment.
The previous number in the spiral is 2025, which is 1 step before 2026 in the D2 direction.
So `2025 = (4,23) - (-1,1) = (5,22)`. This is N6.
The next number in the spiral is 2027, which is 1 step after 2026 in the D2 direction.
So `2027 = (4,23) + (-1,1) = (3,24)`. This is N3.

Now we need to find the values for N1, N2, N4, N5.
To do this, we need a general function `Value(q,r)`.
Let `m` be the layer index for a given coordinate `(q,r)`.
For a point `(q,r)` on the D2 segment: `q` goes from `m` down to `0`, `r` goes from `1` up to `m+1`.
A point `(q,r)` on this segment satisfies `m = q+r-1`.
Let's verify this for 2026 at `(4,23)`: `m = 4+23-1 = 26`. This is correct.
The value for a point `(q,r)` on the D2 segment is `N_{m-1} + 2m + (m-q)`.
Let's test this for 2026 at `(4,23)`: `m=26`.
`Value(4,23) = N_{25} + 2*26 + (26-4) = 1951 + 52 + 22 = 2025`.

Ah, there's a small error in my step count for the value formula.
`N_{m-1} + 2m` is the value at `(m,1)`. This is `2003` for `m=26`.
The number `2004` is at `(25,2)`.
So, the number of steps `x` from `(m,1)` (value `N_{m-1}+2m`) to `(q,r)` is `m-q`.
The number `(q,r)` is `(m-x, 1+x)`.
The value is `(N_{m-1}+2m) + x = (N_{m-1}+2m) + (m-q)`.
So for 2026, value is `2003 + (26-4) = 2003 + 22 = 2025`.
This implies that 2025 is at (4,23).
The question asks for the neighbors of 2026. So 2026 must be the *next* number in the spiral.
If 2025 is at `(4,23)`, then 2026 is at `(4,23) + (-1,1) = (3,24)`.

So, 2026 is at `P = (3,24)`. Let's re-calculate its neighbors.
The neighbors of `P = (3,24)` are:
N1 = (4,24)
N2 = (3,25)
N3 = (2,25)
N4 = (2,24)
N5 = (3,23)
N6 = (4,23)

2026 is at `(3,24)`.
Its previous number (2025) is `(3,24) - (-1,1) = (4,23)`. This is N6. So N6 = 2025.
Its next number (2027) is `(3,24) + (-1,1) = (2,25)`. This is N3. So N3 = 2027.

Now we need `Value(q,r)` for N1, N2, N4, N5.
The rule `m = q+r-1` works for points on the D2 segment (where `q` decreases and `r` increases).
The value formula for D2 segment: `Value(q,r) = N_{m-1} + 2m + (m-q)`.

For N1 = (4,24):
`m = 4+24-1 = 27`. So it's in layer 27.
`Value(4,24) = N_{26} + 2*27 + (27-4) = 2107 + 54 + 23 = 2184`.

For N2 = (3,25):
`m = 3+25-1 = 27`. So it's in layer 27.
`Value(3,25) = N_{26} + 2*27 + (27-3) = 2107 + 54 + 24 = 2185`.

For N4 = (2,24):
`m = 2+24-1 = 25`. So it's in layer 25.
`Value(2,24) = N_{24} + 2*25 + (25-2) = (1+3*24*25) + 50 + 23 = 1801 + 50 + 23 = 1874`.

For N5 = (3,23):
`m = 3+23-1 = 25`. So it's in layer 25.
`Value(3,23) = N_{24} + 2*25 + (25-3) = 1801 + 50 + 22 = 1873`.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
N1: (4,24) -> 2184
N2: (3,25) -> 2185
N3: (2,25) -> 2027
N4: (2,24) -> 1874
N5: (3,23) -> 1873
N6: (4,23) -> 2025

Sum of all 6 neighbors:
2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2025 = 12168.

The final answer is $\boxed{12168}$.
