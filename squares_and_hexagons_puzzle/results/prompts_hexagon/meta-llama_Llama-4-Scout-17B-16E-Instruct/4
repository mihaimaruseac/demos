## Step 1: Understand the hexagonal grid layout and the spiral pattern
The hexagonal grid is laid out in a spiral pattern with natural numbers. To find the neighbors of a given number, we first need to understand how the numbers are arranged. The pattern starts from the center and moves outward in a spiral.

## 2: Identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate it in the spiral. The spiral can be divided into layers or hexagons, with each layer having 6 more numbers than the previous one. The first layer (center) has 1 number, the second layer has 6 numbers, the third layer has 12 numbers, and so on. The nth layer has 6(n-1) numbers.

## 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
Let's calculate the cumulative number of elements up to each layer to find where 2026 falls:
- Layer 1: 1 number (total = 1)
- Layer 2: 6 numbers (total = 1 + 6 = 7)
- Layer 3: 12 numbers (total = 7 + 12 = 19)
- Layer 4: 18 numbers (total = 19 + 18 = 37)
- Layer 5: 24 numbers (total = 37 + 24 = 61)
- Layer 6: 30 numbers (total = 61 + 30 = 91)
- Layer 7: 36 numbers (total = 91 + 36 = 127)
- Layer 8: 42 numbers (total = 127 + 42 = 169)
- Layer 9: 48 numbers (total = 169 + 48 = 217)
- Layer 10: 54 numbers (total = 217 + 54 = 271)
- Layer 11: 60 numbers (total = 271 + 60 = 331)
- Layer 12: 66 numbers (total = 331 + 66 = 397)
- Layer 13: 72 numbers (total = 397 + 72 = 469)
- Layer 14: 78 numbers (total = 469 + 78 = 547)
- Layer 15: 84 numbers (total = 547 + 84 = 631)
- Layer 16: 90 numbers (total = 631 + 90 = 721)
- Layer 17: 96 numbers (total = 721 + 96 = 817)
- Layer 18: 102 numbers (total = 817 + 102 = 919)
- Layer 19: 108 numbers (total = 919 + 108 = 1027)
- Layer 20: 114 numbers (total = 1027 + 114 = 1141)
- Layer 21: 120 numbers (total = 1141 + 120 = 1261)
- Layer 22: 126 numbers (total = 1261 + 126 = 1387)
- Layer 23: 132 numbers (total = 1387 + 132 = 1519)
- Layer 24: 138 numbers (total = 1519 + 138 = 1657)
- Layer 25: 144 numbers (total = 1657 + 144 = 1801)
- Layer 26: 150 numbers (total = 1801 + 150 = 1951)
- Layer 27: 156 numbers (total = 1951 + 156 = 2107)

2026 falls between 1951 and 2107, so it is in the 27th layer.

## 4: Calculate the position of 2026 within its layer
Since 2026 is in the 27th layer, and the total numbers up to the 26th layer is 1951, we subtract 1951 from 2026 to find its position within the layer: 2026 - 1951 = 75. This means 2026 is the 75th number in the 27th layer.

## 5: Understand the structure of a layer
Each layer has 6 more numbers than the layer number (e.g., the 1st layer has 6*1 = 6 numbers, but considering the center as layer 1 with 1 number, adjustments are made). The nth layer actually contains 6*(n-1) numbers. For the 27th layer, there are 6*26 = 156 numbers.

## 6: Find the neighbors of 2026
In a hexagonal grid laid out in a spiral, each number has 6 neighbors. To find them, we consider the layer and position of 2026. However, given the spiral nature and the hexagonal layout, a more efficient approach is to recognize that the sum of the neighbors of any number in this spiral pattern is constant and can be derived from the pattern's symmetry.

## 7: Derive the constant sum of neighbors
For any given number in the spiral, its six neighbors will be symmetrically arranged around it. The numbers in the spiral increase by 1 as we move outward. The sum of the neighbors of any number can be found by considering the numbers directly adjacent to it in the hexagonal grid.

## 8: Apply the property of the hexagonal spiral
A property of this hexagonal spiral is that the sum of the 6 neighbors of any number is equal to 6 times the number itself minus the sum of the 6 numbers that are skipped in the spiral pattern to get to the center (which would be 0 for the central number but for other numbers, it relates to their position). However, a simpler, direct approach to finding the sum of neighbors utilizes recognizing that for any number n in this spiral, its neighbors are n-1, n+1, n-2, n+2, n-3, n+3 (in a linear sense, but considering the hexagonal structure, these are the immediate neighbors).

## 9: Calculate the sum of neighbors for 2026
The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 can actually be directly calculated if we know their values or by using a pattern. However, an efficient way is to realize that due to symmetry, the sum of neighbors of any number n is (n-1) + (n+1) + (n-7) + (n+7) + (n-6) + (n+6) = 6n, because the -1 and +1 cancel out with the -7 and +7 and -6 and +6.

## 10: Apply the formula
The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 is 6 * 2026.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12156}$
