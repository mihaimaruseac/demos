## Step 1: Understand the hexagonal grid layout and the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a hexagonal grid in a spiral pattern. To solve this, we first need to understand how the numbers are arranged. The grid can be thought of as being made of hexagons, with each hexagon having 6 neighbors.

## 2: Identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. The spiral starts from the center and moves outward in a hexagonal pattern.

## 3: Determine the layer of the hexagonal grid where 2026 is located
The number of cells in each layer of the hexagonal grid can be calculated by the formula $3n(n-1) + 1$ for the $n$th layer, but since we're dealing with a spiral and not just layers of hexagons, we need a different approach. We know that the first layer (center) has 1 cell, the second layer has 6 cells, the third layer has 12 cells, and so on, increasing by 6 cells for each subsequent layer.

## 4: Calculate which layer 2026 falls into
Let's calculate how many numbers are in the first few layers:
- Layer 1: 1 number (total = 1)
- Layer 2: 6 numbers (total = 7)
- Layer 3: 12 numbers (total = 19)
- Layer 4: 18 numbers (total = 37)
- Layer 5: 24 numbers (total = 61)
- Layer 6: 30 numbers (total = 91)
- Layer 7: 36 numbers (total = 127)
- Layer 8: 42 numbers (total = 169)
- Layer 9: 48 numbers (total = 217)
- Layer 10: 54 numbers (total = 271)
- Layer 11: 60 numbers (total = 331)
- Layer 12: 66 numbers (total = 397)
- Layer 13: 72 numbers (total = 469)
- Layer 14: 78 numbers (total = 547)
- Layer 15: 84 numbers (total = 631)
- Layer 16: 90 numbers (total = 721)
- Layer 17: 96 numbers (total = 817)
- Layer 18: 102 numbers (total = 919)
- Layer 19: 108 numbers (total = 1027)

2026 falls between 919 and 1027, so it's in the 19th layer.

## 5: Find the exact position of 2026 in the spiral
Since 2026 is in the 19th layer, and there are 108 numbers in this layer, we need to find where 2026 falls within this layer. The first number of the 19th layer is 919 (from step 4), so we subtract 919 from 2026 to find its position within the layer: $2026 - 919 = 1107$. This means 2026 is the 1107th number in the 19th layer, but since we're counting from 1, it's actually the 1107th position.

## 6: Understand the structure of a layer in the hexagonal grid
Each layer of the hexagonal grid has 6 segments of numbers, with each segment having an equal number of numbers (for the nth layer, each segment has n numbers, but considering the spiral pattern, the numbers increase linearly).

## 7: Calculate the neighbors of 2026
However, given the complexity of directly calculating the exact position and then the neighbors, let's simplify by understanding that in a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. For a number in the spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid, its neighbors will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the two diagonal neighbors.

## 8: Find the numbers around 2026
To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 without directly calculating their positions, we can observe the pattern:
- The numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in the spiral will be $2026 - 1$, $2026 + 1$, and four other numbers.
- However, given the hexagonal structure, we can infer that the neighbors will be symmetric around 2026.

## 9: Apply the property of hexagonal numbers
In a hexagonal grid with a spiral pattern, for any given number, its six neighbors can be found by moving one step in each of the six directions. The sum of the neighbors of any number in this pattern can be derived by considering the symmetry and the structure of the grid.

## 10: Derive a general formula or approach for the sum of neighbors
For any number $n$ in this spiral pattern, its neighbors are $n-1$, $n+1$, and four other numbers that are symmetrically disposed around $n$. The exact positions depend on $n$'s location in the spiral.

## 11: Consider the specific case of 2026
Given that 2026 is not at the edge of the grid and assuming it's not on a boundary layer, we can infer that its neighbors will include numbers that are close to it in value.

## 12: Calculate the sum of neighbors
The sum of the 6 neighbors of any number $n$ in this hexagonal spiral grid can be observed to be $6n$ because each number is surrounded by 6 numbers that are symmetrically arranged around it, and when you sum these neighbors, you get $6n$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12156}$
