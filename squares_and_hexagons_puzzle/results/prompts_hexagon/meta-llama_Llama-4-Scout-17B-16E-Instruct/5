## Step 1: Understand the structure of the hexagonal grid
The hexagonal grid is laid out in a spiral pattern, starting from the center. To find the neighbors of any number, we need to understand the pattern and how numbers are arranged around each other.

## 2: Identify the pattern of the spiral
Looking at the grid, it seems that each layer of the spiral adds a certain number of elements. The first layer (center) has 1 element, the second layer has 6 elements, and so on. Each layer $n$ has $6n$ elements.

## 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To find which layer 2026 is in, we calculate the cumulative number of elements up to each layer until we reach or exceed 2026.
- Layer 1: 1 element (total = 1)
- Layer 2: 6 elements (total = 7)
- Layer 3: 12 elements (total = 19)
- Layer 4: 18 elements (total = 37)
- ...
We continue this process to find the layer for 2026.

## 4: Calculate the layer for 2026
The $n$th layer has $1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1)$ elements.
Let's solve $1 + 3n(n-1) \geq 2026$ for $n$.
$3n^2 - 3n + 1 \geq 2026$
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \geq 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \geq 0$
Solving the quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 675 = 0$ gives us the roots, and thus the intervals where $n$ satisfies the inequality.

## 5: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula: $n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, $c = -675$.
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-675)}}{2(1)}$
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2}$
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}$
$n = \frac{1 \pm 51.96}{2}$
So, $n \approx \frac{1 + 51.96}{2} = 26.48$ or $n \approx \frac{1 - 51.96}{2} = -25.48$.
Since $n$ must be positive, $n \geq 26.48$, meaning $n = 27$ because $n$ must be an integer.

## 6: Verify the layer and position of 2026
Now, verify that 2026 is indeed in the 27th layer.
The 26th layer has $1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 25 = 1951$ elements.
The 27th layer has $1 + 3 \cdot 27 \cdot 26 = 2107$ elements.
So, 2026 is in the 27th layer, and its position in this layer can be found by $2026 - 1951 = 75$.

## 7: Determine the neighbors of 2026
In a hexagonal grid laid out in a spiral, each number has 6 neighbors. To find them, we need to understand the pattern of movement:
- The number directly above and below are $\pm 1$ layer and $\pm 6$ positions in that layer (but considering spiral direction).
- The numbers to the left and right are $\pm 1$ position in the same layer but in a hexagonal pattern.

## 8: Find the exact positions of neighbors
Given 2026 is at position 75 in the 27th layer, we find its neighbors by moving in the hexagonal pattern.
The layer has 162 elements (since $6 \cdot 27 = 162$), and we consider positions modulo 162 for wrapping around.

## 9: Calculate the neighbors
The neighbors of 2026 are:
- One layer in, 6 positions back: $2026 - 162 - 1 = 1863$
- One layer in, 1 position back: $2026 - 162 = 1864$
- One layer in, 5 positions forward: $2026 - 162 + 5 = 1869$
- One layer out, 5 positions back: $2026 + 162 - 5 = 2383$
- One layer out, 1 position forward: $2026 + 162 + 1 = 2389$
- One layer out, 6 positions forward: $2026 + 162 + 6 = 2394$

## 10: Sum the neighbors
Sum = $1863 + 1864 + 1869 + 2383 + 2389 + 2394$.

## 11: Perform the sum
Sum = $1863 + 1864 = 3727$
Sum = $3727 + 1869 = 5596$
Sum = $5596 + 2383 = 7979$
Sum = $7979 + 2389 = 10368$
Sum = $10368 + 2394 = 12762$

The final answer is: $\boxed{12762}$
