## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the hexagonal grid
The hexagonal grid has numbers arranged in a spiral pattern. To find the neighbors of a given number, we first need to understand how the numbers are arranged. The grid can be thought of as being made of concentric hexagonal rings, with each ring having 6 more numbers than the previous one.

## 2: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To find the layer (or ring) that 2026 is on, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, but adapted for hexagonal layers. The number of elements in each layer can be described as 6n, where n starts from 1 for the first layer (which has 6 elements). The total number of elements up to and including the nth layer is given by 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 * n * (n + 1) / 2. We need to find n for which this sum is just below or equal to 2026.

## 3: Calculate the layer for 2026
Let's solve for n when the total number of elements up to and including the nth layer is around 2026:
1 + 6 * n * (n + 1) / 2 >= 2026
6 * n * (n + 1) / 2 >= 2025
n * (n + 1) >= 675
n^2 + n - 675 >= 0

## 4: Solve the quadratic inequality
Solving the quadratic equation n^2 + n - 675 = 0:
n = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)) / 2
n = (-1 ± sqrt(2701)) / 2
n = (-1 ± 51.96) / 2
Considering positive n, we get:
n ≈ (-1 + 51.96) / 2 ≈ 25.48

## 5: Identify the exact layer for 2026
Since n must be an integer and we found n ≈ 25.48, 2026 is in the 26th layer (because we round up to the next whole layer).

## 6: Calculate the starting number of the 26th layer
The total numbers up to the 25th layer:
1 + 6 * 25 * (25 + 1) / 2 = 1 + 6 * 25 * 26 / 2 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
So, the 26th layer starts with 1952.

## 7: Find the position of 2026 in the 26th layer
2026 - 1951 = 75, meaning 2026 is the 75th number in the 26th layer.

## 8: Determine the arrangement of numbers in a layer
In a hexagonal layer, numbers increase in a sequence that wraps around the hexagon. The sequence for any layer can be thought of as starting from a corner and moving clockwise or counterclockwise.

## 9: Identify the neighbors of 2026
Given that 2026 is in the 26th layer and is the 75th number, we need to find its 6 neighbors. In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors, which are diagonally up, down, left, right, and the two diagonals.

## 10: Calculate the exact position and neighbors of 2026
The 26th layer has 6 * 26 = 156 numbers. The numbers in the layer are arranged in a hexagon with 26 numbers on each side. To find the neighbors, consider the layer's structure: if we number the vertices of the hexagon 1 to 6 (with 1 being the starting point of the layer), the sequence for the layer would follow a pattern based on the hexagonal structure.

## 11: Convert 2026 to its hexagonal coordinates
However, a more efficient approach to finding neighbors is recognizing that in a hexagonal grid, neighbors of a cell are those directly adjacent. For a number like 2026, which is not on an axis, its neighbors will be symmetric around it.

## 12: Apply hexagonal grid properties to find neighbors
In a hexagonal grid laid out in a spiral, the difference between consecutive numbers in a straight line (horizontally or vertically) alternates. For any given number, its neighbors can be found by adding or subtracting 1, but in a hexagonal pattern, this translates to specific offsets.

## 13: Directly calculate the neighbors of 2026
The direct calculation of neighbors requires understanding the pattern:
- The number before and after 2026 in the sequence (which would be 2025 and 2027),
- And the four other neighbors which require understanding the hexagonal structure.

## 14: Use the pattern to find the sum of neighbors
Recognizing that each number's neighbors are symmetric and that the grid spirals outward, we can observe:
- The neighbors of any number n in a hexagonal spiral grid are n-1, n+1, n-6, n+6, n-7, and n+7 (considering the spiral pattern and hexagonal structure).

## 15: Apply to 2026
For 2026, the neighbors would thus be:
2025, 2027, 2020, 2032, 2019, and 2033.

## 16: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2020 + 2032 + 2019 + 2033 = 12156.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12156}$
