I need to find the six neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral structure. On a hexagonal grid, each number is surrounded by exactly 6 neighbors[1][5]. The spiral expands outward in concentric rings, with ring k containing 6k hexagons[5].

**Finding which ring contains 2026:**

The total number of cells up to and including ring N is given by the formula: 1 + 3N(N+1)[5]

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
- Ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

Since 1951 < 2026 < 2107, the number 2026 is in ring 26.

**Position within the ring:**

2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 cells arranged around the ring[5].

**Finding neighbors on a hexagonal spiral:**

On a hexagonal spiral, the 6 neighbors of any number n (except those at ring boundaries) follow predictable patterns based on the algebraic structure[1]. According to the search results, the straight-line progressions on hexagonal spirals follow quadratic expressions like 3x² + x, 3x² + 2x, etc.[1]

However, to find the specific neighbors of 2026, I need to determine:
1. Its exact position in the ring
2. The coordinates of its six adjacent cells

The neighbors of a number in a spiral consist of:
- The number immediately before it in the sequence (2025)
- The number immediately after it in the sequence (2027)
- Four additional neighbors from adjacent positions in the surrounding rings

On a hexagonal grid spiral, for a number in ring k at position p within that ring, the neighbors include numbers from ring k-1, ring k, and ring k+1[5].

**The six neighbors are:**
- 2025 and 2027 (adjacent in sequence on the same ring)
- Two neighbors from the outer ring 27
- Two neighbors from the inner ring 25
- One additional neighbor on ring 26

Given the structure of hexagonal spirals and that 2026 is at position 75 of 156 in ring 26, the six neighbors would be:
- 2025, 2027 (same ring, sequential)
- Neighbors that correspond to the geometry of the spiral

Based on the hexagonal grid structure where each position has exactly 6 neighbors[1][5], and given the quadratic relationships described[1], the sum of the neighbors of any number n in the spiral follows from the geometric properties of the hexagonal arrangement.

For a number in the interior of the spiral (not at edges or special positions), the six neighbors on a standard hexagonal spiral sum to a value that depends on the number's position and ring. Without the exact coordinate system mapping or visualization, I cannot calculate the precise neighbor values.

To properly answer this question, I would need either: (1) the exact coordinate system used for this specific spiral, (2) a table mapping positions to coordinates, or (3) code that implements this particular spiral's neighbor-finding algorithm. The search results provide general frameworks for hexagonal spirals[1][3][5] but not the specific implementation details needed to compute the neighbors of 2026 in this particular spiral.
