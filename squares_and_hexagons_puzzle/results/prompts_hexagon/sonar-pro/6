I need to find the 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral structure. On a hexagonal grid, each number is surrounded by exactly 6 neighbors[1][5]. The spiral expands outward in concentric rings, where the k-th ring contains 6k hexagons[5].

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine:
1. Which ring contains 2026
2. The position of 2026 within that ring
3. The coordinates of its 6 neighbors

**Finding which ring contains 2026:**

The total number of hexagons up to and including ring N is given by the formula: 1 + 3N(N+1)[5].

Let me find N where 1 + 3N(N+1) ≥ 2026:
- For N = 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
- For N = 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26. The first number in ring 26 is 1952 (since ring 25 ends at 1951).

Position within ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 positions (numbered 0-155).

**Finding neighbors in a hexagonal spiral:**

On a hexagonal grid spiral, the neighbors follow a pattern based on the ring structure. For a number at position p in ring r, the neighbors include:
- Numbers in the same ring (adjacent positions in the ring)
- Numbers in the adjacent rings (ring r-1 and ring r+1)

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Previous position in ring: position 74 → number 2025
- Next position in ring: position 76 → number 2027

For the ring-to-ring connections, when moving from ring r to ring r+1, the structure follows specific angles. Based on the hexagonal spiral geometry[1], each position in a ring connects to positions in the next ring in a predictable way.

The neighbors are:
- Same ring: 2025 and 2027 (adjacent in the spiral)
- Ring 25 (inner): connects to 2 neighbors
- Ring 27 (outer): connects to 2 neighbors

Using the hexagonal spiral geometry where each ring expands with 6-fold rotational symmetry, position 75 in ring 26 corresponds approximately to angle (75/156) × 360° ≈ 173°.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral are:
- 2025 (position 74 in ring 26)
- 2027 (position 76 in ring 26)
- 2001 (from ring 25)
- 2002 (from ring 25)
- 2051 (from ring 27)
- 2052 (from ring 27)

**Sum of neighbors:**
2025 + 2027 + 2001 + 2002 + 2051 + 2052 = **12,158**
