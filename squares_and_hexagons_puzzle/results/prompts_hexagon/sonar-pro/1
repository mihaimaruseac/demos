**2106**

The hexagonal spiral places natural numbers starting with **1** at the center, surrounded by 6 numbers (2-7) in the first ring, 12 numbers (8-19) in the second ring, and generally \(6k\) numbers in the \(k\)-th ring. The last number in ring \(k\) is the centered hexagonal number \(3k(k+1) - 2\)[1][4].

To locate **2026**, find the smallest \(k\) such that \(3k(k+1) - 2 \geq 2026\):
- Solve \(3k^2 + 3k - 2 = 2026\), so \(k \approx 25.44\). Check \(k=25\): \(3 \times 25 \times 26 - 2 = 1947 < 2026\). Check \(k=26\): \(3 \times 26 \times 27 - 2 = 2104 \geq 2026\)[1][4].
- Thus, **2026** is in ring 26, position \(2026 - 1947 = 79\) along its perimeter of 156 cells (\(6 \times 26\)).

In standard counterclockwise spirals on hex grids (matching the pattern with 1 at center, then 2 right, 7 bottom-right, etc.), neighbors are offset by \(\pm 26\) (same ring) or \(\pm 1\) (inner ring) along the spiral order[1][4]. The 6 distinct neighbors of position 79 in ring 26 are positions 78, 80 (same ring: \(2025, 2027\)) and positions 53-57 (ring 25: \(1947 + 53\) to \(1947 + 57\), i.e., \(2000\) to \(2004\)):
- 2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 = **2106**.
