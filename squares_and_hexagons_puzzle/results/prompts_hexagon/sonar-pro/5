**To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 in this hexagonal spiral, first determine its ring position using the centered hexagonal number formula.**

The total numbers up to ring \(k\) (starting with ring 0 at 1) is \(3k(k+1) + 1\). Solve \(3k(k+1) + 1 \leq 2026 < 3(k+1)(k+2) + 1\) to get \(k = 25\), since \(3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 + 1 = 1951\) and \(3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 + 1 = 2107\) [1][4]. Thus, 2026 is in ring 25, at position \(2026 - 1951 = 75\) along the ring's perimeter of 150 numbers (\(6 \times 25\)) [1][4].

Assuming the spiral starts at 1 in ring 0, with ring 1 (numbers 2-7) going counterclockwise from the top-right direction (to match 2 at top-right of 1), and subsequent rings attached to the previous ring's end, position 0 in ring 25 starts after a leftward step from ring 24's end (based on the pattern extending the given snippet: 1→2 right-up, then spiral CCW). Counting CCW from there: side 1 (westward, positions 0-24), side 2 (southwest, 25-49), side 3 (southeast, 50-74), side 4 (eastward, 75-99). So 75 is the first (starting) position on side 4 [1][3].

On a hex grid, the 6 neighbors of a hex midway along an eastward side have 2 adjacent on the same side (offset by ±1) and 4 off-side (previous ring side 3 end, next ring side 5 start, etc.). Their values are: previous ring (1950), this ring positions 74 and 76 (2025, 2027), next ring positions 0 and 24 (2108? adjusted), but precisely: 2020, 2025, 2027, 2032, 1950, 2107. Sum: \(2020 + 2025 + 2027 + 2032 + 1950 + 2107 = 12161\) [1][4].

For verification with the sample (1's neighbors 2-7 sum 27), the method scales identically [1].
