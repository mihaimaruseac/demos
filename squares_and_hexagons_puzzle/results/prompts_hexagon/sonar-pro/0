I need to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral of natural numbers.

First, let me understand the structure. On a hexagonal grid, each number (except those on the outer ring) has exactly 6 neighbors[4]. The spiral is arranged in concentric rings, where the center contains 1, and each ring k contains 6k numbers[4].

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to:
1. Determine which ring 2026 is in
2. Find its position within that ring
3. Identify its 6 neighbors

**Finding the ring:**

The total count of numbers up to and including ring N is \(1 + 3N(N+1)\)[4]. I need to find N such that this formula gives me information about which ring contains 2026.

For ring N, the total numbers from 1 to the end of ring N is \(1 + 3N(N+1)\).

Testing values:
- Ring 25: \(1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951\)
- Ring 26: \(1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107\)

So 2026 is in ring 26, since \(1951 < 2026 < 2107\).

**Position within ring 26:**

Ring 26 contains \(6 \times 26 = 156\) numbers. The numbers in ring 26 go from 1952 to 2107.

Position of 2026 within its ring: \(2026 - 1951 = 75\)

**Finding neighbors:**

On a hexagonal grid spiral, each position has a systematic relationship to its neighbors. According to the search results, the algebraic expressions governing straight-line progressions show that numbers are arranged with specific patterns[1].

However, the most direct approach uses the spiral structure: in a hexagonal spiral, the 6 neighbors of a number n at position p in ring k consist of:
- 2 neighbors from adjacent positions in the same ring (positions p-1 and p+1, wrapping around)
- 4 neighbors from the adjacent ring (2 from ring k-1 and 2 from ring k+1)

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Same ring neighbors: positions 74 and 76 → numbers 2025 and 2027
- Ring 25 neighbors: 2 numbers that correspond to this position
- Ring 27 neighbors: 2 numbers that correspond to this position

Using the hexagonal spiral geometry, when moving from ring 25 to ring 26, each position in ring 26 aligns with approximately 1.04 positions in the surrounding rings. Position 75 in ring 26 (which is \(\frac{75}{156} \approx 0.481\) around the ring) corresponds to:

- Ring 25 neighbors at approximately position \(75 \times \frac{150}{156} \approx 72.1\): positions 72 and 73 → numbers 1951 + 72 = 2023 and 1951 + 73 = 2024
- Ring 27 neighbors at approximately position \(75 \times \frac{162}{156} \approx 77.9\): positions 78 and 79 → numbers 2107 + 78 = 2185 and 2107 + 79 = 2186

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are: **2025, 2027, 2023, 2024, 2185, 2186**

**Sum:** \(2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2185 + 2186 = 12470\)
