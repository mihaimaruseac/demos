Number 2026 lies on ring k where 3k^2+3k+1 ≥ 2026. Solving gives k = 26 (ring 26 runs from 1952 to 2107). Let M = max of ring k = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 2107. Let j = M − n = 2107 − 2026 = 81. Put j = s·k + t with k = 26, so s = 3 and t = 3.

For a cell on ring k at parameters (s,t) the two inner-ring neighbors (ring k−1) have indices
j_in = s·(k−1) + t and j_in − 1,
and the two outer-ring neighbors (ring k+1) have indices
j_out = s·(k+1) + t and j_out + 1,
where numbers are M_inner − j_in, M_inner − (j_in−1), M_outer − j_out, M_outer − (j_out+1). Here
M_inner = 1 + 3·25·26 = 1951, giving inner neighbors 1951 − 78 = 1873 and 1951 − 77 = 1874;
M_outer = 1 + 3·27·28 = 2269, giving outer neighbors 2269 − 84 = 2185 and 2269 − 85 = 2184.

The two same-ring neighbors are 2025 and 2027. Thus the six neighbors are
2025, 2027, 1873, 1874, 2185, 2184,
and their sum is 2025+2027+1873+1874+2185+2184 = 12168.
