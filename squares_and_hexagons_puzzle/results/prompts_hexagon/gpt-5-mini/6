12168

Reason (brief): 2026 lies on ring r where 3r(r+1)+1 ≥ 2026, so r = 26. The first number of ring 26 is 1952, and 2026 is the 75th element of that ring. Using axial hex coordinates with directions
E=(1,0), NE=(0,1), NW=(-1,1), W=(-1,0), SW=(0,-1), SE=(1,-1),
the coordinate of 2026 is (-26,4). Its six neighbors have coordinates
(-25,4), (-26,5), (-27,5), (-27,4), (-26,3), (-25,3),
whose numbers (computed from the ring-position formula) are
1873, 2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874 respectively. Their sum is
1873+2025+2184+2185+2027+1874 = 12168.
