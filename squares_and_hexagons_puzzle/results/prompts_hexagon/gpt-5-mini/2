Number the rings: the last number on ring r is L_r = 1 + 3r(r+1).  
Solve 1+3r(r+1) >= 2026 ⇒ r = 26 (since L_25 = 1951, L_26 = 2107).  
So 2026 is on ring 26; its index within that ring is t = 2026 − L_25 = 2026 − 1951 = 75. The ring 26 starts at the coordinate (26,0) with value 1952 and proceeds in six directions (NW, W, SW, SE, E, NE) with 26 steps each.

Treating axial coordinates where the six direction vectors are
NW = (−1,−1), W = (−1,0), SW = (0,1), SE = (1,1), E = (1,0), NE = (0,−1),
the position of 2026 is
(26,0) + 26·NW + 26·W + 22·SW = (−26,−4).

Add the six neighbor direction vectors to get the neighbor coordinates:
(−27,−5), (−27,−4), (−26,−3), (−25,−3), (−25,−4), (−26,−5).

Convert each coordinate back to its ring and index and hence its number:
- (−27,−5) is on ring 27 at position 76 → 2108 + 76 = 2184
- (−27,−4) is on ring 27 at position 77 → 2108 + 77 = 2185
- (−26,−3) is on ring 26 at position 75 → 1952 + 75 = 2027
- (−25,−3) is on ring 25 at position 72 → 1802 + 72 = 1874
- (−25,−4) is on ring 25 at position 71 → 1802 + 71 = 1873
- (−26,−5) is on ring 26 at position 73 → 1952 + 73 = 2025

Sum = 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2025 = 12,168.

Answer: 12,168.
