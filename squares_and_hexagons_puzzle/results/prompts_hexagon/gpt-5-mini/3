Answer: 12168

Sketch of solution:
- Ring r containing n satisfies 3r^2+3r+1 ≥ n. For n = 2026 this gives r = 26.
- The first number on ring r is N_r = 3r^2 − 3r + 2 = 1952. The index on the ring is s = 2026 − 1952 = 74 (0-based). Each ring is partitioned into 6 sides of length r, so k = floor(s/r) = 2 and i = s − kr = 22.
- Using axial coordinates with corner0 = (r,0) and side directions d0 = (−1,1), d1 = (−1,0), d2 = (0,−1), d3 = (1,−1), d4 = (1,0), d5 = (0,1), the coordinate of 2026 is corner2 + 22·d2 = (−26,4).
- The six neighbor coordinates are: (−27,5),(−27,4),(−26,3),(−25,3),(−25,4),(−26,5).
- Converting these back to ring indices and labels gives the neighbor numbers 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874, 1873, 2025.
- Summing: 2184+2185+2027+1874+1873+2025 = 12168.
