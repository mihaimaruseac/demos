Answer: 12168

Outline of solution:
- Ring containing 2026 is r = 26 because 1 + 3·26·27 = 2107 and 1 + 3·25·26 = 1951, so ring 26 contains 1952..2107.
- Let N(R) = 1 + 3R(R+1). For a ring R the last (max) number N(R) sits at coordinate cR = (0,R) in axial (q,r) coordinates. Moving backwards around the ring uses the 6 axial-step directions repeated R times:
  D0 = W = (−1,0), D1 = NW = (0,−1), D2 = NE = (1,−1), D3 = E = (1,0), D4 = SE = (0,1), D5 = SW = (−1,1).
- For n on ring R let d = N(R) − n. Writing d = mR + p (0 ≤ m ≤ 5, 0 ≤ p < R), the coordinate of n is cR + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} R·D_i + p·D_m and the index t = d.
- For 2026: R = 26, d = 2107 − 2026 = 81 = 3·26 + 3. This gives the coordinate of 2026 at (3, −26).
- Its six neighbors (adding the six unit directions) have coordinates and lie on rings 25, 26, or 27. Converting each neighbor coordinate back to its ring index t (as above) gives the neighbor numbers:
  2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874, 1873.
- Their sum is 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
