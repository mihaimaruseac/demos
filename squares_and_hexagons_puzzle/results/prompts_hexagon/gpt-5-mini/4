Answer: 12168

Sketch of solution:
- The hex spiral has ring r (r=0 at center) ending at M(r)=1+3r(r+1).  
  Solve 1+3r(r+1) ≥ 2026 to find r=26. The 26th ring runs from S=1952 to M(26)=2107.
- The index along the 26th ring is k = 2026 − 1952 = 74 (0-based with S at k=0).  
  The ring path (starting at S) goes: p0 = (26,−25), then NE (r−1) steps, NW r steps, W r steps, ...
  k=74 falls into the W side; its position is (-23,26). (One can check this by the piecewise coordinate formula for the ring.)
- The six neighbors are at coordinates
  (-22,26), (-23,27), (-24,27), (-24,26), (-23,25), (-22,25).
  Converting these back to their spiral numbers gives
  2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874, 1873.
- Their sum is 2025+2184+2185+2027+1874+1873 = 12168.
