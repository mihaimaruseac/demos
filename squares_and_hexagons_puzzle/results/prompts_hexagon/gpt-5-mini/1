Number 2026 lies on ring n where 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026. Solving gives n = 26. The numbers on ring 26 run from S = M(25)+1 = 1952 up to 2107, so 2026 is at step s = 2026 − 1952 = 74 along that ring.

Using axial coordinates and the standard hex‑spiral step directions, the six neighbors of the cell at step s are the cells with numbers
- s − 1 on the same ring: 1952 + 73 = 2025
- s + 1 on the same ring: 1952 + 75 = 2027
- two inner‑ring neighbors (on ring 25): 1873 and 1874
- two outer‑ring neighbors (on ring 27): 2184 and 2185

Summing them:
1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.

Answer: 12168.
