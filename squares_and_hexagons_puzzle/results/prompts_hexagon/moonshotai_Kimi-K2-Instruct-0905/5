### Understanding the Problem

We have a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a hexagonal grid. Here's a snippet of how the numbers are arranged:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, we can observe that:

- The number `1` is at the center.
- Around `1`, there's a ring of numbers: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.
- Beyond that, there's another ring: `8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16`, etc.

Each number has six neighbors in the hexagonal grid. For example, the neighbors of `1` are `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

Our goal is to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number `2026`.

### Visualizing the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in the hexagonal spiral. 

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. When we arrange numbers in a spiral, starting from `1` at the center, each new "ring" or "layer" around the center adds more numbers. 

Here's how the layers can be visualized:

- **Layer 0**: Just `1` (the center).
- **Layer 1**: The six numbers around `1` (`2` to `7`).
- **Layer 2`: The next twelve numbers (`8` to `19`), and so on.

Each layer `n` (starting from `n=0` for the center) contains `6 * n` numbers. 

So, the total numbers up to layer `n` is `1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)`.

This means that the largest number in layer `n` is `1 + 3n(n + 1)`.

For example:
- Layer 0: `1` (largest number is `1`).
- Layer 1: `2` to `7` (largest is `7 = 1 + 3*1*2`).
- Layer 2: `8` to `19` (largest is `19 = 1 + 3*2*3`), etc.

### Determining the Layer of 2026

First, let's find out which layer `2026` is in. 

We need to find the smallest `n` such that `1 + 3n(n + 1) >= 2026`.

Let's solve `3n^2 + 3n + 1 >= 2026`:
`3n^2 + 3n - 2025 >= 0`.

Divide by 3:
`n^2 + n - 675 >= 0`.

Solve the quadratic equation `n^2 + n - 675 = 0`:
`n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*675)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2`.

`sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97`, so `n ≈ (50.97)/2 ≈ 25.48`.

So, the smallest integer `n` is `26`.

Let's check `n=25`:
`1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.

`n=26`:
`1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107`.

So, `2026` is in layer `26`, since `1951 < 2026 <= 2107`.

### Structure of a Layer

Within a layer, numbers are arranged in six "arms" or "directions" corresponding to the six sides of the hexagon. 

Each layer `n` has `6n` numbers, divided into `6` segments of `n` numbers each. 

For example, in layer 1 (`n=1`), there are `6` numbers (`2` to `7`), each in one segment.

In layer 2 (`n=2`), there are `12` numbers (`8` to `19`), divided into `6` segments of `2` numbers each.

Each segment corresponds to a direction: let's say `NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW`.

### Position within the Layer

Now, let's find out where `2026` is within layer `26`.

First, calculate how many numbers are in layer `25`:
`1 + 3*25*26 = 1951`.

So, layer `26` starts at `1952` and goes up to `2107`.

Total numbers in layer `26`: `2107 - 1951 = 156` (which is `6*26`).

Now, let's find out which segment `2026` is in.

Each segment has `26` numbers (`n=26`).

So, the segments are:
1. `1952` to `1952 + 25 = 1977`
2. `1978` to `1978 + 25 = 2003`
3. `2004` to `2004 + 25 = 2029`
4. `2030` to `2030 + 25 = 2055`
5. `2056` to `2056 + 25 = 2081`
6. `2082` to `2082 + 25 = 2107`

`2026` falls in the third segment (`2004` to `2029`).

Its position within the segment is `2026 - 2004 + 1 = 23` (i.e., it's the `23rd` number in the third segment).

### Identifying Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors. For a number in layer `n`, its neighbors can be:

1. The number "before" it in the same segment (if it exists).
2. The number "after" it in the same segment (if it exists).
3. The number in the same position in the previous segment (from the same layer).
4. The number in the same position in the next segment (from the same layer).
5. The number "towards the center" (from the previous layer).
6. The number "away from the center" (from the next layer, if it exists).

However, since `2026` is in layer `26`, and there's no layer `27` yet (as `2107` is the largest number we've considered), the "away from the center" neighbor would be in the next layer, but we don't have numbers beyond `2107` in our current setup. 

But actually, the neighbors can be from the same layer, the previous layer, or the next layer, but since the next layer is not fully constructed, we need to find a pattern or formula to determine the neighbors based on the position.

A better approach is to realize that the neighbors are:

- The adjacent numbers in the same layer (previous and next in the segment, and the corresponding numbers in adjacent segments).
- The number directly "inside" (towards the center) from it, which is in layer `25`.
- The number directly "outside" (away from the center) from it, which is in layer `27` (but since `2026` is in layer `26`, `2026` is not at the end of the spiral, so layer `27` exists beyond `2107`).

But since we're only given up to `16` in the initial snippet, and we've extrapolated up to `2107`, we can assume that the spiral continues indefinitely, and we can find the neighbors based on the position.

Alternatively, we can observe that the neighbors are:

1. The previous number in the same segment (if it exists).
2. The next number in the same segment (if it exists).
3. The number in the same position in the previous segment.
4. The number in the same position in the next segment.
5. The number directly inward (from layer `25`).
6. The number directly outward (from layer `27`).

But calculating all these directly seems tedious. Instead, we can find a pattern or formula for the neighbors based on the position within the layer.

### Finding the Inward and Outward Neighbors

The key is to realize that:

- The "inward" neighbor is the number in layer `25` that is in the same relative position.
- The "outward" neighbor is the number in layer `27` that is in the same relative position.
- The other neighbors are within the same layer, adjacent in the segments.

Given that `2026` is the `23rd` number in the `3rd` segment of layer `26`, its inward neighbor is the `23rd` number in the `3rd` segment of layer `25`.

Similarly, its outward neighbor is the `23rd` number in the `3rd` segment of layer `27`.

The other neighbors are the `22nd` and `24th` numbers in the same segment (if they exist), and the `23rd` numbers in the `2nd` and `4th` segments of layer `26`.

But since `2026` is the `23rd` in its segment, and each segment has `26` numbers, the `22nd` and `24th` exist.

### Calculating the Neighbors

Let's calculate each neighbor:

1. Previous in same segment: `2026 - 1 = 2025`.
2. Next in same segment: `2026 + 1 = 2027`.
3. Same position in previous segment: 
   - The `3rd` segment starts at `2004`.
   - The `2nd` segment starts at `1978`.
   - The `23rd` number in the `2nd` segment is `1978 + 22 = 2000`.
4. Same position in next segment:
   - The `4th` segment starts at `2030`.
   - The `23rd` number in the `4th` segment is `2030 + 22 = 2052`.
5. Inward neighbor (from layer `25`):
   - Layer `25` has `6*25 = 150` numbers, divided into `6` segments of `25`.
   - The `3rd` segment in layer `25` starts at `1951 + 2*25 + 1 = 1951 + 50 + 1 = 2002` (but this seems off; let's recalculate).
   - Actually, layer `25` starts at `1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801` (but earlier we had layer `25` ending at `1951`, so it starts at `1951 - 150 + 1 = 1802` to `1951`).
   - The `3rd` segment in layer `25` starts at `1802 + 2*25 = 1852`.
   - The `23rd` number is `1852 + 22 = 1874`.
6. Outward neighbor (from layer `27`):
   - Layer `27` starts at `2108` (since layer `26` ends at `2107`).
   - The `3rd` segment in layer `27` starts at `2108 + 2*27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162`.
   - The `23rd` number is `2162 + 22 = 2184`.

Wait a minute, let's correct the inward neighbor calculation:

Layer `25` is from `1802` to `1951`, divided into `6` segments of `25` numbers.

The `3rd` segment starts at `1802 + 2*25 = 1852`.
The `23rd` number is `1852 + 22 = 1874`.

Similarly, outward neighbor:

Layer `27` starts at `2108`, `6` segments of `27`.
`3rd` segment starts at `2108 + 2*27 = 2162`.
`23rd` number: `2162 + 22 = 2184`.

### Listing the Neighbors

So, the six neighbors are:

1. `2025` (previous in segment)
2. `2027` (next in segment)
3. `2000` (same position in previous segment)
4. `2052` (same position in next segment)
5. `1874` (inward)
6. `2184` (outward)

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum them up:
`2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2052 + 1874 + 2184`.

Let's calculate step by step:
`2025 + 2027 = 4052`.
`4052 + 2000 = 6052`.
`6052 + 2052 = 8104`.
`8104 + 1874 = 9978`.
`9978 + 2184 = 12162`.

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of `2026` is **`12162`**.
