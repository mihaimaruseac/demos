### Understanding the Problem

First, let's visualize the hexagonal spiral grid based on the given example:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, we can observe the following:

- The number `1` is at the center.
- Around `1`, the numbers `2` through `7` are placed in a hexagonal pattern.
- The spiral continues outward, with numbers increasing as we move away from the center.

Our goal is to find the six neighbors of the number `2026` in this spiral and then sum them up.

### Identifying the Pattern

To find the neighbors of `2026`, we need to understand how numbers are arranged in this hexagonal spiral. Let's try to generalize the pattern based on the given small example.

From the center outward:

1. **First Ring (around 1):**
   - The numbers `2` through `7` surround `1`.
   - This suggests that the first complete ring around `1` contains `6` numbers (since a hexagon has 6 sides).

2. **Second Ring:**
   - The next numbers seem to be `8` onwards.
   - From `8` to `19` (assuming the pattern continues), this would be the next layer.

However, the given example only shows up to `16`, but it's enough to see that each new layer adds a hexagonal ring around the previous one.

### Determining the Ring of 2026

To find the neighbors of `2026`, we first need to determine which ring (or layer) `2026` is in. 

In a hexagonal spiral:
- The center is `1` (ring 0).
- The first ring (ring 1) contains numbers `2` to `7` (6 numbers).
- The second ring (ring 2) contains numbers `8` to `19` (12 numbers).
- The third ring (ring 3) contains numbers `20` to `37` (18 numbers).
  
Generally, the nth ring contains `6 * n` numbers. 

The total numbers up to ring n is:
`1 (center) + 6*1 + 6*2 + ... + 6*n = 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*n*(n + 1)/2 = 1 + 3*n*(n + 1)`.

We need to find the smallest n such that `1 + 3*n*(n + 1) >= 2026`.

Let's solve for n:
`3n^2 + 3n + 1 >= 2026`
`3n^2 + 3n - 2025 >= 0`
`n^2 + n - 675 >= 0`

Solving the quadratic equation `n^2 + n - 675 = 0`:
`n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2`
`sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97`
`n ≈ (50.97)/2 ≈ 25.485`

So, n = 26 (since n must be an integer).

Check for n = 25:
`3*25*26 + 1 = 1950 + 1 = 1951`
So, up to ring 25, the largest number is `1951`.

For n = 26:
`3*26*27 + 1 = 2106 + 1 = 2107`
So, ring 26 contains numbers from `1952` to `2107`.

Since `2026` is between `1952` and `2107`, it is in ring 26.

### Finding the Position of 2026 in Its Ring

Now, we need to find out where `2026` is located within ring 26. 

Each ring is divided into 6 segments (like the sides of a hexagon), each containing `n` numbers (where n is the ring number). 

So, ring 26 has `6 * 26 = 156` numbers, divided into 6 segments of `26` numbers each.

The numbers in ring n are arranged such that each side of the hexagon corresponds to a direction (like up, up-left, etc.), and each side has `n` numbers.

The first number in ring 26 is `1952`.
The last number is `2107`.

To find which segment `2026` is in:
`2026 - 1951 = 75` (since `1951` is the last number of ring 25)
So, `2026` is the `75th` number in ring 26.

Each segment has `26` numbers, so:
`75 / 26 ≈ 2.88`, so it's in the 3rd segment (since 2 full segments would be `52` numbers, and `75 - 52 = 23` into the 3rd segment).

So, `2026` is the `23rd` number in the 3rd segment of ring 26.

### Identifying the Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number (except the center) has 6 neighbors. The neighbors of a number in ring n are:
1. The number before it in the same ring (if it's not the first in its segment).
2. The number after it in the same ring (if it's not the last in its segment).
3. The number directly "inside" it (i.e., the number in the previous ring that it's "attached" to).
4. The number directly "outside" it (i.e., the number in the next ring that it's "attached" to).
5. Two numbers from the previous and next segments that are adjacent in the hexagonal sense.

However, since we're dealing with a spiral, the neighbors can be more precisely identified by considering the structure where each number in ring n is adjacent to:
- Its immediate predecessor and successor in the ring (if they exist).
- One number from ring n-1 (the "inner" neighbor).
- One number from ring n+1 (the "outer" neighbor).
- Two numbers from the adjacent segments in the same ring (but these are the same as predecessor and successor).

But actually, in the hexagonal spiral, each number in ring n has:
- Two neighbors in the same ring (before and after, unless it's at a corner).
- One neighbor in ring n-1 (the number it's "attached" to from the inside).
- Three neighbors in ring n+1 (the numbers that are "attached" to it from the outside).

But this seems inconsistent with the initial small example. Let me re-examine the small example to understand the neighbor relationships.

From the small example:

Consider `7`:
Its neighbors are `1` (inside), `6` and `8` (same ring), and then `16`, `6` is already counted, but this seems confusing.

Perhaps a better approach is to realize that in the hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number are:
- Its immediate predecessor and successor in the same ring (if they exist).
- The number directly inside it (from ring n-1).
- The numbers that are "ahead" and "behind" in the next ring that are adjacent to it.

Given the complexity, perhaps a better method is to find that the six neighbors are:
1. The number before it in the same ring.
2. The number after it in the same ring.
3. The number directly inside it (from ring n-1).
4. The number directly outside it (from ring n+1).
5. The number before the inside one in ring n-1.
6. The number after the inside one in ring n-1.

But this may not be accurate. Instead, let's think differently: since the spiral is continuous, the six neighbors can be found by calculating the "addresses" of the adjacent cells based on the spiral's numbering.

### Calculating the Neighbors Based on Ring Position

Given that `2026` is the `23rd` number in the `3rd` segment of ring `26`, we can find its neighbors as follows:

1. **Same ring neighbors:**
   - Previous number: `2025` (if it's not the first in its segment, which it's not, since it's 23rd in segment).
   - Next number: `2027` (if it's not the last in its segment, which it's not, since segment has 26 numbers).

2. **Inner ring neighbor:**
   - The inner neighbor is the number in ring 25 that corresponds to the same "position" as 2026 in ring 26.
   - Ring 25 has `6 * 25 = 150` numbers, divided into 6 segments of 25.
   - Since `2026` is in the 3rd segment of ring 26, its inner neighbor is in the 3rd segment of ring 25.
   - The first number of ring 25 is `1951 - 150 + 1 = 1802` (since up to ring 24 is `3*24*25 + 1 = 1801`, so ring 25 starts at `1802`).
   - The 3rd segment in ring 25 starts at `1802 + 2*25 = 1852` (since first segment is `1802-1826`, second `1827-1851`, third `1852-1876`).
   - The inner neighbor is the `23rd` number in the 3rd segment of ring 25, which is `1852 + 22 = 1874` (since first is `1852`, 23rd is `1852 + 22`).

3. **Outer ring neighbors:**
   - Similarly, the outer neighbors are in ring 27, which starts at `2108` (since up to ring 26 is `2107`).
   - Ring 27 has `6 * 27 = 162` numbers, divided into 6 segments of 27.
   - The 3rd segment starts at `2108 + 2*27 = 2162`.
   - The outer neighbor is the `23rd` number in the 3rd segment of ring 27, which is `2162 + 22 = 2184`.
   - Additionally, there are two more outer neighbors that are "attached" to the previous and next in the same ring, but these are the same as the next and previous in the outer ring's sequence, which are `2183` and `2185` (but `2184` is the direct outer, so this might overlap).

Wait, perhaps it's better to realize that the six neighbors are:
1. Previous in same ring: `2025`
2. Next in same ring: `2027`
3. Direct inner: `1874`
4. Direct outer: `2184`
5. The inner's previous: `1873`
6. The inner's next: `1875`

But this gives us six distinct neighbors:
- `2025`, `2027` (same ring)
- `1874` (inner)
- `2184` (outer)
- `1873`, `1875` (inner's neighbors)

However, `1873` is the previous to `1874` in ring 25, and `1875` is the next to `1874` in ring 25.

Similarly, we could include outer's previous and next, but that would exceed six. So, the correct six are:
1. Same ring previous: `2025`
2. Same ring next: `2027`
3. Inner direct: `1874`
4. Outer direct: `2184`
5. Inner's previous: `1873`
6. Inner's next: `1875`

Now, let's sum these:
`2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2184 + 1873 + 1875`

Calculating step by step:
`2025 + 2027 = 4052`
`4052 + 1874 = 5926`
`5926 + 2184 = 8110`
`8110 + 1873 = 9983`
`9983 + 1875 = 11858`

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number `2026` is **12158**.

Wait a minute, let me double-check the addition to ensure no arithmetic error:

`2025 + 2027 = 4052`
`1874 + 2184 = 4058`
`1873 + 1875 = 3748`
Now, `4052 + 4058 = 8110`
`8110 + 3748 = 11858`

Yes, the correct sum is indeed **11858**. 

However, initially, I thought it was 12158, but upon rechecking, it's 11858. 

Final answer: **11858**.
