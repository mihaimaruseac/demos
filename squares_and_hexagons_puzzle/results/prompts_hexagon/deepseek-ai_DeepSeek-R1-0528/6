<think>
The problem involves natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. I need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the snippet, it looks like the center is 1, surrounded by numbers in a hexagonal pattern. Let me sketch this out based on the given numbers.

It shows:

... 14  4  3 10 ...

.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, around 1, we have 2,3,4,5,6,7? But it's hexagonal, so six neighbors. Let me list the neighbors of 1.

Directly to the right of 1 is 2. Then above-right is 3? But in the diagram, it's shown as 1, then to the right 2, and above 1 is 3? But in hexagonal grid, directions might be different.

Perhaps I should assign coordinates to make it easier. I recall that in hexagonal grids, we often use axial coordinates or cube coordinates.

Let me define a coordinate system. I'll place the center at (0,0). Since it's a hex grid, each hex has six neighbors.

The spiral probably starts at 1 and goes outward in rings.

Looking at the numbers: center is 1.

Then around it: 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the diagram, next to 1 is 2, and then above is 3? But 3 is listed above, but in the same "ring" I see 2,3,9,10? I'm confused.

Let me list the numbers given:

In the center: 1

Immediately adjacent: to the right: 2, above-right: 3? But 3 is shown above, but in the same line as 10? The diagram is messy.

Perhaps the sequence is: starting from 1, move right to 2, then down-right to 3? But in the diagram, it's shown as:

Row 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ... so probably 14,4,3,10 are in a row.

Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9 so 15,5,1,2,9

Row 3: 16,6,7,8 so 16,6,7,8

But it's hexagonal, so the rows are offset. Probably row 2 is shifted relative to row 1 and 3.

Typically in hex grids, rows are offset. So let's assume that row 2 is centered, row 1 is above and to the right, row 3 is below and to the left or something.

From the numbers, around 1: directly right is 2, directly left? But in row 2, left of 1 is 5? But 5 is listed, and below 1 is 6? But in row 3, 6 is below-left or something.

Let's list the neighbors of 1 based on the diagram.

From row 2: left of 1 is 5, right is 2.

From row 1: below-left of 1? Row 1 has 4 and 3 near 1. Specifically, 3 is above-right of 1? And 4 is above-left? But 4 is left of 3 in row 1.

Row 1: positions: let's say from left to right: 14,4,3,10

Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9

Row 3: 16,6,7,8

Now, hexagonally, each cell in row 2 has neighbors in row 1 and row 3.

Specifically, cell at position i in row j has neighbors at i and i-1 in adjacent rows, depending on offset.

Typically, if rows are offset, then for a cell in row r, column c, neighbors are (r,c±1), (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1) or something like that. I need to standardize.

I recall that in a hexagonal spiral, the numbers are arranged in rings, where each ring has 6 more cells than the previous ring.

Let me calculate the number of cells per ring.

Ring 0: center, 1 cell, number 1.

Ring 1: around center, 6 cells. From the diagram, neighbors of 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the diagram, I see 2,3,5,6, but also 9,10, etc. Let's see what numbers are present.

From diagram: 1 is center. Then adjacent are 2 (right), 5 (left), and then above and below. Above-right is 3? But 3 is in row 1, which is above row 2. In row 1, above 1 is 3? But there's also 4 left of 3. Below 1 is 6 in row 3, and 7 right of 6.

But 6 and 7 are below, but not directly below. Let's see the neighbors.

Assume that for cell (0,0) = 1.

Then neighbor to the east: 2, at (1,0) or something.

Perhaps use cube coordinates for hex grid.

In cube coordinates, each hex can be represented by three coordinates (q,r,s) with q+r+s=0.

The neighbors are at (q±1,r,s∓1), (q,r±1,s∓1), (q±1,r∓1,s), but since q+r+s=0, it's sufficient to use two coordinates.

Standard axial coordinates: let's say q and r, then s = -q-r.

Neighbors are: (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q-1,r+1), (q+1,r-1).

Now, in the spiral, it starts at (0,0) = 1.

Then it moves to the next cell. Typically, it moves in a direction, and turns at corners.

From the diagram, after 1, it goes to 2, which is to the east, so (1,0) = 2.

Then from 2, it goes to 3. In the diagram, 3 is above-right of 2? From row 2 to row 1. In row 2, 2 is at position, say column 3, row 2: columns: 15 at col 1, 5 at col 2, 1 at col 3, 2 at col 4, 9 at col 5? But then row 1 has 14 at col 1? 4 at col 2? 3 at col 3? 10 at col 4? This is messy.

Notice that in row 1, above row 2, the cells are offset. Typically, for even rows or odd rows, the offset is different.

From the numbers, the cell above 1 is 3, and above 2 is not directly above, but in hex grid, above might be shared.

Let's list the cells adjacent to 1.

From the diagram:

- To the right: 2

- To the left: 5

- Above-right: 3 (since in row 1, which is above, and 3 is above 1)

- Above-left: 4? But 4 is left of 3 in row 1, so if 3 is above 1, then 4 is above-left of 1.

- Below-right: 7? In row 3, 7 is below-right of 1? Row 3 has 6,7,8. 6 is below-left of 1? Since below 1 is probably 6, and 7 is right of 6.

- Below-left: 6? But 6 is below-left, then below-right would be 7.

But that would be only five neighbors? Hex should have six.

I have: right:2, left:5, above-right:3, above-left:4, below-left:6, below-right:7. Yes, and 8 is further, 9 is to the right of 2, etc.

So neighbors of 1 are: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in the diagram, it shows 2,3,5,6, but 4 and 7 are also there. 4 is in row 1, left of 3, and 7 is in row 3, right of 6.

So yes, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But 7 is neighbor? Is 7 adjacent to 1? From the positions: 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 5 at (-1,0), 3 at (0,1)? Let's assign.

Suppose (0,0) = 1.

East: (1,0) = 2

Then northeast: in cube coords, if q increases east, r increases northeast, then northeast is (1,1,-2)? Better to define.

Set q as east-west, r as north-south, but in hex, it's axial.

Define: let q be the column, r be the row.

For cell at (q,r), neighbors are (q±1,r), (q,r±1), and (q±1,r∓1) depending on parity, but to avoid parity, use axial coordinates with q and r, and neighbors are (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1).

Now, distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) or something, but in this system, the Manhattan distance is |q| + |r| + |s| but s= -q-r, so |q| + |r| + |q+r|, but for axial, it's usually max of absolute values or something. For simplicity, the ring number k is such that the cells with max(|q|,|r|) = k or something.

From the neighbors: (1,0) = 2, (-1,0) = 5, (0,1) = 3? Then (0,-1) should be below, but in diagram below is 6, so (0,-1) = 6.

Then above-left: if (0,1) = 3, then above-left might be (-1,1) = 4.

Below-right: (1,-1) = 7.

And below-left: if below is (0,-1)=6, left is (-1,0)=5, so below-left might be (-1,-1)? But we have six neighbors: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1).

(1,-1) and (-1,1) are the diagonals.

In this case, neighbors are: (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=5, (0,1)=3, (0,-1)=6, (1,-1)=7, (-1,1)=4.

Yes, matches: 2,5,3,6,7,4.

Perfect.

So coordinate system: axial coordinates q,r.

q horizontal, r vertical? But in hex, it's slanted, but for counting, it's fine.

The spiral continues. After 7, it goes to 8. Where is 8? In diagram, row 3: 16,6,7,8. So 8 is right of 7. Since 7 is at (1,-1), then east would be (2,-1)=8.

Then after 8, it goes to 9. In diagram, row 2 has 9 at the end, right of 2. 2 is at (1,0), so east would be (2,0), but row 2 has 9 at column 5, while 2 is column 4, so probably (2,0)=9? But earlier we have (2,-1)=8, and (2,0)=9.

Then after 9, it goes to 10. In row 1, 10 is right of 3. 3 is at (0,1), so east would be (1,1)=10? In diagram, row 1 has 10 at end, and 3 at some position.

Row 1: 14,4,3,10. So if 3 is at (0,1), 4 at (-1,1), then 10 at (1,1)? And 14 at (-2,1)? Probably.

After 10, next should be 11, but not shown. Then 12,13,14,15,16.

In diagram, row 1 has 14,4,3,10. So 14 is left, then 4,3,10. But 14 might be part of the next ring.

Ring 1: cells at distance 1: we have six cells: (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=5, (0,1)=3, (0,-1)=6, (1,-1)=7, (-1,1)=4. So numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in the diagram, 8 is at (2,-1), which is further, so probably ring 2 starts after that.

The spiral continues from 7 to 8 at (2,-1), then to 9 at (2,0), then to 10 at (1,1)? From 9 at (2,0), where next? Probably to the northeast or something.

In diagram, after 10, but 10 is in row 1, and next might be above. But diagram shows 14 left of 4, so probably from 10 at (1,1), it goes to (0,2) or something.

Standard hexagonal spiral: after completing a ring, it moves to the next.

The number of cells in ring k: since hexagonal, each ring has 6k cells for k>=1, and ring 0 has 1 cell.

Ring 0: k=0, 1 cell.

Ring 1: k=1, 6 cells.

Ring 2: k=2, should have 12 cells? Since each subsequent ring adds 6 cells? No.

In a hexagonal lattice, the number of cells at distance exactly k from center.

Distance in hex grid is the minimum number of steps to center.

For distance k, the number of cells is 6k for k>=1, and 1 for k=0.

For k=1, 6 cells, yes.

For k=2, cells where max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) = 2? In axial coordinates, the distance is max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| )? Earlier I thought, but let's compute.

The axial distance: actually, in axial coordinates, the Manhattan distance is |dq| + |dr| + |ds| but s=-q-r, so |q| + |r| + |q+r|, but this is not standard.

Standard hex distance is ( |dq| + |dr| + |ds| ) / 2 where s=-q-r, but since q+r+s=0, the distance is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2.

For example, from (0,0) to (1,0): |1| + |0| + | -1| = 2, divided by 2 is 1, good.

To (1,1): |1|+|1|+| -2|=4/2=2, distance 2.

To (2,0): |2|+|0|+| -2|=4/2=2, distance 2.

To (0,2): |0|+|2|+| -2|=4/2=2, distance 2.

Now, how many cells at distance exactly k?

For k=0: (0,0), 1 cell.

k=1: cells with dist 1: (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1). s=q+r? Earlier we have (1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|1-1|=|1|+|-1|+|0|=1+1+0=2? Distance is (|q|+|r|+|q+r|)/2? For (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, divided by 2 is 1, yes dist 1.

But (1,-1) is neighbor, dist 1.

Now dist 2: cells where (|q|+|r|+|q+r|)/2 = 2, so |q|+|r|+|q+r| =4.

Possible: q=2,r=0: |2|+|0|+|2|=2+0+2=4

q=-2,r=0: same

q=0,r=2: |0|+|2|+|2|=0+2+2=4

q=0,r=-2: same

q=1,r=1: |1|+|1|+|2|=1+1+2=4

q=1,r=-2: |1|+|-2|+|1-2|=1+2+1=4? |q+r|=|-1|=1

q=-1,r=-1: same

q=-1,r=1: | -1| + |1| + |0| =1+1+0=2? Dist 1, already in k=1.

List all with |q|+|r|+|q+r| =4.

Assume q,r integers.

Cases:

- |q|=2, r=0: then |q+r|=|2+0|=2, so |2|+|0|+|2|=4

- q=0, |r|=2: |0|+|2|+|2|=4

- |q|=1, |r|=1: then |q+r| could be |1+1|=2 or |1-1|=0 or |-1+1|=0, etc.

If q=1,r=1: |1|+|1|+|2|=4

q=1,r=-1: |1|+|-1|+|0|=1+1+0=2<4

q=-1,r=1: same, | -1|+|1|+|0|=2

q=-1,r=-1: | -1|+|-1|+| -2|=1+1+2=4

q=2,r=0: already

q=0,r=2: already

q=3,r=-1: |3|+|-1|+|2|=3+1+2=6>4

q=2,r=1: |2|+|1|+|3|=2+1+3=6>4

So only: (2,0), (-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2), (1,1), (-1,-1)

(1,1) and (-1,-1)

But earlier (1,-1) is dist 1, not dist 2.

So cells: (2,0), (-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2), (1,1), (-1,-1)

That's only 6 cells? But should be more for ring 2.

I think I missed some. For example, (1,-1) is dist 1, but what about (2,-1)? |2|+|-1|+|1|=2+1+1=4, so dist 2.

Oh, I missed q=2,r=-1: |2|+|-1|+|1|=2+1+1=4

Similarly, q=2,r=1: |2|+|1|+|3|=2+1+3=6>4? |q+r|=|3|=3, yes 2+1+3=6, dist 3.

q=1,r=0: |1|+|0|+|1|=1+0+1=2, dist 1.

q=1,r=1: |1|+|1|+|2|=4, dist 2

q=1,r=-1: |1|+|-1|+|0|=2, dist 1

q=0,r=1: |0|+|1|+|1|=2, dist 1

q=2,r=0: |2|+|0|+|2|=4, dist 2

q=2,r=-1: |2|+|-1|+|1|=2+1+1=4, dist 2

q=2,r=-2: |2|+|-2|+|0|=2+2+0=4, dist 2

q=2,r=-2: |q|+|r|+|q+r|=|2|+|-2|+|0|=2+2+0=4, yes.

Similarly, q=1,r=-2: |1|+|-2|+|-1|=1+2+1=4

q=0,r=-2: |0|+|-2|+|-2|=0+2+2=4

q=-1,r=0: dist 1

q=-1,r=1: | -1|+|1|+|0|=1+1+0=2, dist 1

q=-1,r=-1: | -1|+|-1|+|-2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2

q=-2,r=0: | -2|+|0|+|-2|=2+0+2=4

q=-2,r=1: | -2|+|1|+|-1|=2+1+1=4

q=-2,r=2: | -2|+|2|+|0|=2+2+0=4

q=0,r=2: already

q=1,r=2: |1|+|2|+|3|=1+2+3=6, dist 3

So all cells with |q| + |r| + |q+r| = 4.

Now list them:

Fix q, r.

q=0: |r| + |0+r| = |r| + |r| = 2|r| =4, so |r|=2, r=2 or -2: (0,2),(0,-2)

q=1: |1| + |r| + |1+r| =1 + |r| + |1+r| =4

So |r| + |1+r| =3

If r>=0, |r|=r, |1+r|=1+r, so r +1+r=3, 2r+1=3, 2r=2, r=1

If r<0, |r|=-r, |1+r| = |1+r|, if r>=-1, |1+r|=1+r, so -r +1+r=1<3? Not.

If r<-1, |1+r| = -(1+r) = -1-r, so |r| + |1+r| = -r + (-1-r) = -2r -1 =3, so -2r=4, r=-2

So r=1 or r=-2: (1,1),(1,-2)

q=2: |2| + |r| + |2+r| =2 + |r| + |2+r| =4, so |r| + |2+r| =2

If r>=0, r + (2+r) =2r+2=2, 2r=0, r=0

If r<0, |r|=-r, |2+r|: if r>=-2, |2+r|=2+r, so -r +2+r=2, always true? But r<0.

When r>=-2, |2+r|=2+r if r>=-2, which is true for r>=-2, but r<0, so for r in [-2,0), |r| + |2+r| = -r + (2+r) =2, yes.

But we have equality to 2, and it's 2 for all r in [-2,0), but r integer, so r=-2,-1

r=-2: |r|=2, |2+r|=|0|=0, 2+0=2? |q|+|r|+|q+r|=|2|+|-2|+|0|=2+2+0=4, yes

r=-1: |2|+|-1|+|1|=2+1+1=4, yes

r=0: |2|+|0|+|2|=2+0+2=4, already have

But for r=0, we have (2,0)

r=-1: (2,-1)

r=-2: (2,-2)

q=3: |3|+|r|+|3+r|=3+|r|+|3+r|=4, so |r|+|3+r|=1

Possible only if r=0? |0|+|3|=3>1? No, or r=-1: | -1|+|2|=1+2=3>1? r=-2: | -2|+|1|=2+1=3>1? r=-3: | -3|+|0|=3+0=3>1. No solution, since min is 3 when |q|=3.

Similarly for negative q.

q=-1: | -1| + |r| + |-1+r| =1 + |r| + |r-1| =4, so |r| + |r-1| =3

If r>=1, r + (r-1)=2r-1=3, 2r=4, r=2

If r<=0, |r|=-r, |r-1|=1-r (since r<=0<1), so -r +1-r=1-2r=3, -2r=2, r=-1

But r=2 and r=-1

r=2: (-1,2)

r=-1: (-1,-1)

q=-2: | -2| + |r| + |-2+r| =2 + |r| + |r-2| =4, so |r| + |r-2| =2

If r>=2, r + (r-2)=2r-2=2, 2r=4, r=2

If r<=0, |r|=-r, |r-2|=2-r, so -r +2-r=2-2r=2, -2r=0, r=0

If 0<r<2, |r|=r, |r-2|=2-r, so r +2-r=2, always true. So r=0,1,2? But integers.

r=0: (-2,0)

r=1: (-2,1)

r=2: (-2,2)

Now list all:

From q=0: (0,2),(0,-2)

q=1: (1,1),(1,-2)

q=2: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2)

q=-1: (-1,2),(-1,-1)

q=-2: (-2,0),(-2,1),(-2,2)

q=3: no

Also q=-3: similarly no

But we have (1,-2), etc.

Now total: (0,2),(0,-2),(1,1),(1,-2),(2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-1),(-2,0),(-2,1),(-2,2)

That's 12 cells. Yes, for ring k=2, 12 cells.

Similarly, ring k has 6k cells for k>=1.

k=1:6, k=2:12, k=3:18, etc.

Now the numbers are filled in spiral order, starting from center.

The spiral starts at (0,0)=1.

Then moves to (1,0)=2 (east).

Then turns to northeast, to (1,-1)? But earlier we have (1,-1)=7? No, in our assignment, (1,0)=2, then next is 3 at (0,1)? But in the diagram, after 2 is 3, but 3 is at (0,1), which is northwest of (1,0).

From (1,0), moving northwest to (0,1).

In cube coordinates, if q east, r north, then from (1,0), northwest might be (0,1) or (1,1), but (1,1) is northeast.

Standard direction: often in hex spirals, after moving east, it turns left to northwest.

From (1,0) to (0,1), which is decreasing q, increasing r.

Then from (0,1)=3, it might continue to (-1,1)=4.

Then from (-1,1)=4, to (-1,0)=5? But in diagram, after 4 is not shown, but probably to west, to (-2,0)? But we have 5 at (-1,0).

In diagram, after 3 is 10? No, the sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...

From center: 1, then 2 (east), then 3 (northwest? to (0,1)), then 4 (west? to (-1,1)? but (-1,1) is west-northwest.

From (0,1) to (-1,1), which is west.

Then from (-1,1) to (-1,0)=5? But in diagram, 5 is below, but (-1,0) is southwest of (-1,1).

Actually, from (-1,1) to (-1,0), decreasing r.

Then to (-1,-1)=? but we have 6 at (0,-1), not at (-1,-1).

In diagram, after 5 is 6, which is below, so probably from (-1,0)=5 to (0,-1)=6? Which is southeast.

Then from (0,-1)=6 to (1,-1)=7? Southeast.

Then from (1,-1)=7 to (2,-1)=8? East.

Then from (2,-1)=8 to (2,0)=9? Northeast? Increasing r.

Then from (2,0)=9 to (2,1)? But in diagram, after 9 is 10 at (1,1)? But (2,1) is not assigned yet.

In ring 2, we need to fill 12 cells.

Currently, after 7 (which is end of ring 1? Ring 1 has cells up to 7? Numbers: ring 0:1, ring 1:2,3,4,5,6,7. So after 7, ring 2 starts with 8.

8 at (2,-1), then 9 at (2,0), then 10 at (1,1)? But (1,1) is in ring 2.

From (2,0)=9, next should be to (1,1)? Which is northwest.

Then to (0,2)? But in diagram, after 10 is not shown, but we have 14,4,3,10 in row 1, and 4 is already assigned, so probably next is (0,2) or something.

The spiral continues: after (1,1)=10, it should go to (0,2)=11? Then to (-1,2)=12? Then to (-2,2)=13? Then to (-2,1)=14? Then to (-2,0)=15? Then to (-2,-1)? Then to (-1,-1)=16? Then to (0,-2)=17? Then to (1,-2)=18? Then to (2,-2)=19? Then back to (2,-1) but already filled? No, (2,-1) is already 8, but ring 2 ends there? But we have only 12 cells.

List the order.

Start ring 2: from after ring 1, which ended at (1,-1)=7. Then move east to (2,-1)=8.

Then move northeast to (2,0)=9? From (2,-1) to (2,0), which is increasing r, same q, so north? In hex, moving north.

In axial coords, from (q,r) to (q,r+1) is north, (q+1,r) east, etc.

From (2,-1) to (2,0) is north.

Then from (2,0)=9, move northwest to (1,1)? Which is decrease q, increase r.

(1,1)=10.

Then from (1,1)=10, move west to (0,1)? But (0,1) is already occupied by 3. So cannot. So must turn.

Typically, at corners, it turns.

From (1,1), since it's a corner, it might move west to (0,1), but occupied, so instead move southwest or something.

In standard spiral, after moving northwest, it might continue west, but since (0,1) is occupied, it turns south or something.

In this case, from (1,1), it moves west to (0,1)? But occupied, so probably it moves to (0,2) or to (-1,2).

In the diagram, after 10 is 14? But 14 is at left, so probably it moves west to (-1,1)? But (-1,1) is already 4, occupied. So must be different.

Perhaps the direction is different. Let's see the sequence from the diagram.

From the given numbers: we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...

In diagram: row 1: 14,4,3,10 — so probably 4,3,10 are assigned, but 14 is new.

Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9 — 5,1,2,9 assigned.

Row 3: 16,6,7,8 — 6,7,8 assigned.

So numbers 1 to 16 are all assigned? 1 to 8 are shown, 9,10,14,15,16 shown, so 11,12,13 missing? No, probably not all shown, but in the diagram, only up to 16, but 11,12,13 are not listed, so perhaps they are in other positions.

Perhaps after 10, it goes to 11 at (0,2), then 12 at (-1,2), then 13 at (-2,2), then 14 at (-2,1), then 15 at (-2,0), then 16 at (-2,-1)? But in diagram, 14 is in row 1, which is r=1, at q=-2? Row 1 has 14 at left, so q=-2, r=1? Then 15 in row 2, q=-2, r=0? Then 16 in row 3, q=-2, r=-1? Then next would be (-1,-1) or something.

But in diagram, row 3 has 16,6,7,8, so at r=-1, q=-2:16, q=-1:6? But 6 is at (-1,-1)? Earlier we had (0,-1)=6, so (-1,-1) should be different.

Let's list all cells with their numbers based on diagram.

From diagram:

- r=1 (row 1): cells: q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10

- r=0 (row 2): q= -2:15, q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9

- r= -1 (row 3): q= -2:16, q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8

Now, also, there must be cells at r=2, r=-2, etc. for ring 2.

For example, (0,2), (1,1) is already 10, (1,1) is r=1,q=1, which is not in the rows given, so probably row 1 is only for r=1, but q from -2 to 1, but (1,1) is included, q=1,r=1 is 10, yes.

But (2,1) is not listed, (0,2) not listed, etc.

In ring 2, cells like (2,0)=9, (2,-1)=8, (2,-2) not listed, (1,-2) not, etc.

From the spiral order, after 9 at (2,0), it goes to 10 at (1,1), then to 11 at (0,2), then to 12 at (-1,2), then to 13 at (-2,2), then to 14 at (-2,1), then to 15 at (-2,0), then to 16 at (-2,-1), then to 17 at (-1,-1)? But in diagram, at (-1,-1) is 6? But 6 is already assigned, and it's in r=-1,q=-1, which is occupied by 6, but 6 is ring 1, so must be different.

Perhaps from (-2,-1)=16, it goes to (-1,-1), but occupied, so turns to (0,-2) or to (1,-2).

In diagram, no number at (-1,-1), but in row 3, at q=-1,r=-1 is 6, but 6 is at (0,-1)? Let's see the coordinates.

From earlier, we have:

(0,0):1

(1,0):2

(0,1):3

(-1,1):4

(-1,0):5

(0,-1):6

(1,-1):7

(2,-1):8

(2,0):9

(1,1):10

Now next should be 11. In diagram, not shown, but probably (0,2):11

Then (-1,2):12

Then (-2,2):13

Then (-2,1):14 (since in row 1, q=-2,r=1 is 14)

Then (-2,0):15 (row 2, q=-2,r=0 is 15)

Then (-2,-1):16 (row 3, q=-2,r=-1 is 16)

Then next, to (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) is not assigned yet. In row 3, at q=-1,r=-1 is 6, but 6 is already at (0,-1)? No, in row 3, q=-1,r=-1 is listed as 6, but according to coordinates, (0,-1) should be r=-1,q=0, which is 6, and (-1,-1) should be different.

In the cell list, for r=-1, we have q=-2:16, q=-1:6, but if (0,-1)=6, then q=-1,r=-1 should be another cell.

Perhaps I have a mistake in coordinate assignment.

Let's list the cells with their (q,r) based on the grid.

Assume that for each r, q ranges.

From the diagram, for r=0 (row 2): cells at q= -2:15, q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9

So at r=0, q from -2 to 2.

Similarly, r=1 (row 1): q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10

q=2 not listed, so perhaps q from -2 to 1 for r=1.

r= -1 (row 3): q= -2:16, q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8

q=2 not listed.

Now, the cell at (q,r) = (0,1): r=1,q=0:3

(1,1): r=1,q=1:10

(2,0): r=0,q=2:9

(2,-1): r= -1,q=2:8? But in row 3, q=1 is 8, not q=2. In row 3, cells are q= -2, -1,0,1: 16,6,7,8, so q=1,r= -1:8

But (2,-1) would be q=2,r= -1, which is not listed, so probably not present or in another row.

For r= -1, q only up to 1, not 2.

But earlier we have (2,-1)=8, but if r= -1, q=2, but in diagram, at r= -1, q=1 is 8, so perhaps (2,-1) is not in this row; perhaps the grid is not fully covered, or perhaps I need to see that (2,-1) is at a different r.

Perhaps the r is not the row index; perhaps the rows are not aligned.

In hex grid, the r coordinate may not correspond directly to row number.

From the neighbors, for example, cell at (0,0): neighbors (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1)

In the grid, (1,0):2, (-1,0):5, (0,1):3, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7, (-1,1):4, as before.

Now, cell at (2,0): what is it? In diagram, at r=0,q=2:9

Cell at (2,-1): but in r= -1, q=2 not listed, but in r= -1, q=1 is 8, which is (1,-1)? But (1,-1) is already 7.

Confusion.

Cell at q=1,r= -1: in row 3, q=1 is 8, so (1,-1)=8? But earlier we have (1,-1)=7 for the first ring.

Mistake.

In the diagram, for row 3 (r= -1): cells: q= -2:16, q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8

But (0,-1) should be r= -1,q=0, which is 7, but earlier I said (0,-1)=6, but here it's 7.

Inconsistency.

Let's list the cells:

- At position where 1 is: let's say (0,0)

- To its right: 2, so (1,0)

- To its left: 5, so (-1,0)

- Above it: in row 1, above 1 is 3, and since row 1 is above, and 3 is directly above, so (0,1)

- Below it: in row 3, below 1 is 6? But in row 3, below 1 is cell with 7? Let's see the alignment.

In row 2: cells: let's say columns: col a:15, col b:5, col c:1, col d:2, col e:9

Row 1: col a:14, col b:4, col c:3, col d:10

Row 3: col a:16, col b:6, col c:7, col d:8

Now, typically, in hex grid, the cell above col c of row 2 is col c of row 1, which is 3, so above 1 is 3.

Below 1 is in row 3, col c is 7, so below 1 is 7.

But earlier I thought below is 6, but 6 is in row 3, col b, which is below col b of row 2, which is 5.

So below 5 is 6.

For cell 1 at (0,0):

- East: cell at col d, row 2:2, so (1,0)

- West: cell at col b, row 2:5, so (-1,0)

- Northeast: cell at col c, row 1:3, which is above and to the left? In hex, northeast might be (0,1) or (1,1).

In this case, cell at (0,1) is 3.

- Northwest: cell at col b, row 1:4, which is at (-1,1) if we set.

- Southeast: cell at col d, row 3:8? But below and right. Cell at (1,-1) should be southeast.

In row 3, col d is 8, which is below col d of row 2, which is 2, so below 2 is 8.

But below 1 is 7 at col c, row 3.

So for cell 1 (0,0):

- East: (1,0)=2

- West: (-1,0)=5

- Northeast: (0,1)=3

- Northwest: (-1,1)=4

- Southeast: (1,-1)=7? But in row 3, col d is 8, which is below col d, so if col d is q=1, then (1,-1)=8? But we have 7 at col c, which is q=0, r= -1:7

So southeast of (0,0) should be (1,-1), which is 8 in this case? But earlier for ring 1, it should be 7 or something.

Let's define the coordinates properly.

Set for cell at (q,r):

- (0,0) = 1

- The cell at east: (1,0) = 2

- The cell at northeast: in this grid, from (0,0), northeast is (0,1) = 3, because it's directly above in the diagram, but in hex, northeast might be different, but in this case, it's (0,1)

- Then northwest: from (0,0), northwest is (-1,1) = 4

- Then west: (-1,0) = 5

- Then southwest: from (-1,0), southwest might be (-1,-1) or (0,-1)

In diagram, below 5 is 6, at row 3, col b, so if col b is q= -1, r= -1, then (-1,-1) = 6

- Then southeast: from (0,0), southeast should be (1,-1) = 7? But in diagram, at (1,-1) is 8? Let's see.

From (0,0), the cell below is at row 3, col c:7, so (0,-1) = 7

Then below and right is at row 3, col d:8, so (1,-1) = 8

But then for cell 2 at (1,0): its neighbors should include (1,1), (2,0), (1,-1), etc.

(1,1): in row 1, col d:10, so (1,1) = 10

(2,0): in row 2, col e:9, so (2,0) = 9

(1,-1):8, as above

(0,0):1

(0,1):3

(2,1): not assigned yet.

So neighbors of 2: east: (2,0)=9, west: (0,0)=1, northeast: (1,1)=10, northwest: (0,1)=3, southeast: (2,-1)? or (1,-1)=8, southwest: (0,-1)=7

So yes, six neighbors: 9,1,10,3,8,7.

Now back to the spiral order.

Start at (0,0)=1

Move east to (1,0)=2

Then from 2, in the spiral, it should move to the next, which is 3 at (0,1), but (0,1) is not adjacent to (1,0)? Is (0,1) adjacent to (1,0)? Distance: |0-1| + |1-0| + |0+1-1-0| wait, |dq| + |dr| + |ds| with s= -q-r, so from (1,0) to (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds= -(-1)-1 =1-1=0? s1 = -1-0= -1, s2 = -0-1= -1, so ds=0, so | -1| + |1| + |0| =1+1+0=2, distance 1, yes adjacent.

From (1,0) to (0,1) is a valid move, northwest.

So from 2 at (1,0) to 3 at (0,1)

Then from 3 at (0,1) to 4 at (-1,1) (west)

Then from 4 at (-1,1) to 5 at (-1,0) (southwest? or south)

From (-1,1) to (-1,0), decreasing r, so south.

Then from 5 at (-1,0) to 6 at (-1,-1) (south? or southeast)

In diagram, below 5 is 6, so to (-1,-1)=6

Then from 6 at (-1,-1) to 7 at (0,-1) (east? or northeast)

From (-1,-1) to (0,-1), increasing q, so east.

Then from 7 at (0,-1) to 8 at (1,-1) (east)

Then from 8 at (1,-1) to 9 at (2,0) ? From (1,-1) to (2,0), which is increasing q and r, so northeast.

| dq=1, dr=1, ds= -1-1= -2? s1= -1-(-1)=0? s= -q-r, so at (1,-1), s= -1-(-1)=0, at (2,0), s= -2-0= -2, ds= -2-0= -2, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, |ds|=2, sum 1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent! Oh no.

Mistake.

From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent. Adjacent cells should have distance 1.

From (1,-1), neighbors are: (2,-1), (0,-1), (1,0), (1,-2), (2,-2), (0,0)? Let's calculate.

Cell (q,r) = (1,-1)

Neighbors: (q+1,r)=(2,-1), (q-1,r)=(0,-1), (q,r+1)=(1,0), (q,r-1)=(1,-2), (q-1,r+1)=(0,0), (q+1,r-1)=(2,-2)

So neighbors: (2,-1), (0,-1), (1,0), (1,-2), (0,0), (2,-2)

In the grid, (0,-1)=7, (1,0)=2, (0,0)=1, all already occupied. (2,-1) not assigned, (1,-2) not, (2,-2) not.

In the spiral, from 8 at (1,-1), it should go to an unoccupied neighbor. Typically, it continues in the direction it was going or turns.

Previously, from 7 to 8, it was moving east (increasing q), from (0,-1) to (1,-1).

So from (1,-1), if it continues east, to (2,-1)

In the diagram, is there a cell at (2,-1)? In row 3, we have only up to q=1, so probably not, or in another row. Perhaps for r= -1, q=2 is not in the same row, but in the grid, it should be there.

Perhaps the grid has more cells. In ring 2, there are 12 cells, so far we have filled 9 cells: 1 to 8 and 9 at (2,0), 10 at (1,1), so 10 cells? 1 to 10, but ring 0 and 1 have 1+6=7 cells, ring 2 has 12, so total up to ring 2 should be 1+6+12=19 cells, but we have only up to 10 in the diagram, so many missing.

From 8 at (1,-1), it should go to (2,-1) =11? Then to (2,0)=12? But (2,0) is already 9, occupied.

Conflict.

Perhaps after 7 at (0,-1), it goes to (1,-1)=8, then to (1,0)? but (1,0) is 2, occupied.

So must go to (2,-1) or (1,-2).

In standard hexagonal spiral, it often moves to the cell in the direction of the tangent.

I recall that for hexagonal spiral, the ring k starts at cell (k,0) or something.

Let me look for a pattern or formula for the number at (q,r).

The distance from center is d = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2

As we had.

For a given d, the number of cells with distance < d is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+(d-1)) = 1 + 6* \frac{(d-1)d}{2} = 1 + 3d(d-1)

Since sum from k=1 to m of k is m(m+1)/2, but here for k from 1 to d-1, number is 6k, so sum_{k=1}^{d-1} 6k = 6* \frac{(d-1)d}{2} = 3d(d-1)

Then total cells within distance d-1 is 1 + 3d(d-1)

Then for distance exactly d, there are 6d cells.

The spiral starts at (0,0), and for each ring d, it starts at (d,0) and moves in directions.

For ring d, it starts at (d,0), then moves in the direction of the neighbors.

For example, ring 1 (d=1): starts at (1,0)=2

Then moves to (0,1)=3 (northwest)

Then to (-1,1)=4 (west)

Then to (-1,0)=5 (southwest)

Then to (-1,-1)=6 (south)

Then to (0,-1)=7 (southeast)

Then to (1,-1)? But (1,-1) is at distance 1, but already in ring 1, and next should be ring 2, but (1,-1) is not filled yet? In our earlier, we have 7 at (0,-1), and then 8 at (1,-1), but (1,-1) is distance 1, same as ring 1, but we have only 6 cells for ring 1, so (1,-1) should be part of ring 2.

Distance of (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, divided by 2 is 1, so dist 1, same as (1,0), etc.

But in ring 1, we have six cells: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1). But (1,-1) is not included? But (1,-1) is also at distance 1, since |q|+|r|+|s| = |1|+|-1|+|0| =2, dist 1.

But in the list, we have only six, but (1,-1) is seventh? No, for dist 1, the cells are all with |q| + |r| + |q+r| =2.

As earlier: (1,0): |1|+ |0| + |1| =1+0+1=2

(0,1):0+1+1=2

(-1,1):1+1+0=2

(-1,0):1+0+1=2

(0,-1):0+1+1=2

(-1,-1):1+1+2? | -1|+|-1|+|-2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2! Oh! I see, I made a mistake earlier.

For ( -1,-1): q= -1, r= -1, s = -q-r = -(-1)-(-1) =1+1=2? s = -q - r, so for (q,r), s = -q - r, so at ( -1,-1), s = - (-1) - (-1) =1+1=2

Then |q| + |r| + |s| = | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, so dist = 4/2 =2.

Similarly, (1,-1): q=1,r= -1, s= -1 - (-1) = -1+1=0, |1| + | -1| + |0| =1+1+0=2, dist 1.

But ( -1,-1): dist 2.

So for dist 1: cells with |q| + |r| + |s| =2, with s= -q-r.

This is equivalent to max(|q|,|r|,|s|) =1, but not exactly.

Cells: as before: (1,0): s= -1, |1|+0+1=2

(0,1): s= -1, 0+1+1=2

(-1,0): s=1, 1+0+1=2

(0,-1): s=1, 0+1+1=2

(1,-1): s=0, 1+1+0=2

(-1,1): s=0, 1+1+0=2

And that's all; (0,0) has sum 0, dist 0.

So six cells: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)

No ( -1,-1) or (1,1) at dist 1; those are dist 2.

In our earlier assignment from diagram, we have (1,-1)=7, (-1,1)=4, etc.

So for ring 1: cells: (1,0)=2, (0,1)=3, (-1,1)=4, (-1,0)=5, (0,-1)=6, (1,-1)=7? But in diagram, (0,-1)=7, (1,-1)=8? Let's clarify with diagram.

From diagram:
- (0,0):1
- (1,0):2
- (0,1):3
- (-1,1):4
- (-1,0):5
- (0,-1):7? But earlier I thought 6, but in row 3, at q=0,r= -1:7
- (1,-1):8

But ( -1,-1) is not assigned yet.

And (0,-1) is 7, not 6.

So what is 6? In row 3, at q= -1,r= -1:6, so (-1,-1)=6

Oh! So ( -1,-1)=6

So neighbors of 1:
- east: (1,0)=2
- west: (-1,0)=5
- northeast: (0,1)=3
- northwest: (-1,1)=4
- southeast: (1,-1)=8? But (1,-1) is 8, but should be a neighbor, but in the list, we have 6 at (-1,-1), which is southwest.

For (0,0), neighbors are:
- (1,0):2
- (-1,0):5
- (0,1):3
- (0,-1):7
- (1,-1):8
- (-1,1):4

But (-1,-1) is also a neighbor? Distance from (0,0) to (-1,-1): | -1| + | -1| + | -1-1| wait |q| + |r| + |s| = | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, dist 2, not neighbor.

So neighbors are only the six at dist 1: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)

In the diagram, (0,-1)=7, (1,-1)=8, (-1,1)=4, etc.

So (0,-1)=7, not 6.

6 is at (-1,-1), which is not a neighbor of 1; it's a neighbor of 5 and 7, etc.

So correct assignment from diagram:
- (0,0):1
- (1,0):2
- (0,1):3
- (-1,1):4
- (-1,0):5
- (-1,-1):6  (row 3, col b)
- (0,-1):7  (row 3, col c)
- (1,-1):8  (row 3, col d)
- (2,0):9  (row 2, col e)
- (1,1):10 (row 1, col d)
- and so on.

Now spiral order: start at 1.

Then move east to 2 at (1,0)

Then from 2, move northwest to 3 at (0,1)  // since (0,1) is adjacent and unoccupied

Then from 3, move west to 4 at (-1,1)

Then from 4, move southwest to 5 at (-1,0)  // or south, since r decreases

From (-1,1) to (-1,0), decreasing r, so south.

Then from 5 at (-1,0), move south to 6 at (-1,-1)  // since below it is 6

Then from 6 at (-1,-1), move east to 7 at (0,-1)  // increasing q

Then from 7 at (0,-1), move east to 8 at (1,-1)  // to (1,-1)

Then from 8 at (1,-1), now unoccupied neighbors: (2,-1), (1,0), but (1,0) is occupied by 2, so only (2,-1) or (2,0) or (1,-2), etc.

Typically, it should move to the next ring. Since it was moving east, and at a corner, it turns north.

So to (2,0) or to (2,-1).

From (1,-1), (2,-1) is east, (2,0) is northeast.

In the diagram, after 8 is 9 at (2,0), so probably to (2,0)=9

Distance from (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, ds= -1-1= -2? s1= -1-(-1)=0, s2= -2-0= -2, ds= -2-0= -2, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, |ds|=2, sum 4, dist 2, not adjacent! Same problem.

From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent; adjacent are (2,-1), (0,-1), (1,0), (1,-2), (2,-2), (0,0)

(0,-1) and (1,0) occupied, so (2,-1), (1,-2), (2,-2)

In the spiral, it might go to (2,-1) first.

But in diagram, (2,0) is 9, and it's assigned, but (2,-1) is not assigned yet.

Perhaps (2,-1) is 11 or something.

Let's assume that from 8 at (1,-1), it goes to (2,-1) =9? But in diagram (2,0) is 9, so not.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Perhaps the move from 8 to 9 is to (1,0), but occupied, or to (0,0), occupied.

Another idea: after 7 at (0,-1), it went to 8 at (1,-1), then to 9 at (2,0), but since not adjacent, perhaps the grid is not with axial coordinates, or perhaps it's a different type of hex grid.

Perhaps the spiral is filled in a different order.

Let's list the cells in order from the diagram and the numbers.

From the center, the sequence is: 1, then 2 (east), then 3 (northwest), then 4 (west), then 5 (southwest), then 6 (south), then 7 (southeast), then 8 (east), then 9 (northeast), then 10 (northwest), etc.

From 1 to 2: east

2 to 3: northwest

3 to 4: west

4 to 5: southwest? or south? from (-1,1) to (-1,0), south.

5 to 6: south, to (-1,-1)

6 to 7: east, to (0,-1)

7 to 8: east, to (1,-1)

8 to 9: from (1,-1) to (2,0), which is not adjacent, but in the grid, (2,0) is at a different location.

Perhaps from 8, it moves to (2,-1) first, but not assigned, or to (1,0), occupied.

Perhaps after 7, it doesn't go to 8 at (1,-1), but to (0,0) or something.

Let's calculate the number at each cell based on the spiral path.

I recall that in a hexagonal spiral, the number at position can be found by determining the ring and the arc.

For a given number n, find its ring and position.

The ring number k is the smallest integer such that the total cells up to ring k is at least n.

Total cells up to ring k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6* \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1 cell

k=1: 1+6=7 cells

k=2: 1+6+12=19 cells

k=3: 1+6+12+18=37 cells

k=4: 1+6+12+18+24=61 cells, and so on.

For a number n, find k such that 3k(k-1) +1 < n ≤ 3k(k+1) +1

The first number in ring k is a_k = 3k(k-1) +2

For k=1: a_1 = 3*1*0 +2 =2, yes.

k=2: 3*2*1 +2=6+2=8, but in our case, ring 2 starts after 7, so 8, yes.

k=3: 3*3*2 +2=18+2=20, so 20 is start of ring 3.

Now, in ring k, there are 6k cells.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are in order: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, or something like that.

For ring k, it starts at (k,0) for k>=1.

For k=1: (1,0)=2

Then it moves to the next cell in the ring.

For k=1: only 6 cells, but it's small.

For k=2: starts at (2,0)=8? But in our diagram, (2,0)=9, not 8.

8 is at (1,-1), which is not on the axis.

Perhaps starts at (k,1-k) or something.

For ring k, the starting cell is at (k,0) for k>=0, but for k=0, (0,0)=1.

For k=1, (1,0)=2

Then it moves in the direction of the first side, which is northwest, to (0,1)=3

Then to (-1,1)=4, but for k=1, after 2, it goes to 3, then 4, etc, but in k=1, after 2 at (1,0), it goes to (0,1)=3, then to (-1,1)=4, then to (-1,0)=5, then to (-1,-1)=6, then to (0,-1)=7, then back to (1,-1)? but (1,-1) is also in ring 1, but we have only 6 cells, so it should end at 7 at (0,-1), and (1,-1) is in ring 2.

But in our assignment, (1,-1)=8, which is start of ring 2.

So for ring 2, starts at (1,-1)=8

Then moves to (2,0)=9? But not adjacent.

From (1,-1), it can move to (2,-1) or (2,0) or (1,0) but occupied.

Perhaps it moves to (2,-1)=9

Then to (2,0)=10

Then to (1,1)=11, and so on.

In the diagram, (2,0)=9, (1,1)=10, so perhaps (2,-1) is not used, or is later.

Assume that for ring k, it starts at (k,1-k) or something.

For k=1: start at (1,0)=2

For k=2: start at (1,-1)=8

Then from there, it might move east to (2,-1)=9

Then northeast to (2,0)=10

Then northwest to (1,1)=11

Then west to (0,2)=12

Then southwest to (-1,2)=13

Then south to (-1,1)=14, but (-1,1) is already 4, occupied.

So not.

Perhaps after (2,0)=10, it goes to (1,1)=11, then to (0,2)=12, then to (-1,2)=13, then to (-2,1)=14, etc.

In diagram, (-2,1)=14, (-2,0)=15, (-2,-1)=16, etc.

So for ring 2: cells: (1,-1)=8, (2,-1)=9? not assigned, (2,0)=9 in diagram, so perhaps (2,-1) is skipped or later.

Perhaps the start is at (2,0) for ring 2.

In diagram, (2,0)=9, which is after 8 at (1,-1), so 8 is still in ring 1 or ring 2.

Let's calculate the distance.

Cell (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + |1-1| = |1| + | -1| + |0| =1+1+0=2, dist 1, so ring 1.

But ring 1 has only 6 cells, and we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, so 7 cells? 1 is ring 0, 2 to 7 are ring 1, but 6 cells, so 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In our list: 2 at (1,0), 3 at (0,1), 4 at (-1,1), 5 at (-1,0), 6 at (-1,-1), 7 at (0,-1), and 8 at (1,-1), but (1,-1) is also dist 1, so should be in ring 1, but then 8 cells, but should be 6.

This is the problem.

Unless (0,-1) is not dist 1, but |0| + | -1| + |0-1| =0+1+1=2, dist 1, same as others.

So all six cells are covered by 2,3,4,5,6,7, and (1,-1) is an additional cell at dist 1, but it can't be.

Perhaps the distance is defined differently.

In some systems, the distance is max(|q|,|r|,|s|), with s= -q-r.

For (0,0): max(0,0,0)=0

(1,0): max(1,0,1)=1

(0,1): max(0,1,1)=1

(1,1): max(1,1,2)=2

(1,-1): max(1,1,0)=1? |r| for (1,-1) is | -1|=1, s=0, so max(1,1,0)=1

(-1,-1): max(1,1,2)=2

So for dist 1: max| q|,|r|,|s| =1, which includes (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1), and also (1,1)? max(1,1,2)=2, not 1. (0,0) is 0.

So only the six cells, no more.

In ring 1, cells are those with dist 1, i.e., max(|q|,|r|,|s|) =1, which are the six cells: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)

In the diagram, we have cells at (0,0):1, (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8, and also (-1,-1):6

But (-1,-1) has max(|-1|,|-1|,|2|)=2, so dist 2, not in ring 1.

So for ring 1, only 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,7,8? But 6 is at (-1,-1), dist 2, so in ring 2.

So the numbers: ring 0:1 at (0,0)

 ring 1: 2 at (1,0), 3 at (0,1), 4 at (-1,1), 5 at (-1,0), 6 at ? not assigned yet, 7 at (0,-1), 8 at (1,-1)

But we have only 6 cells, but 6 is missing; 6 is at (-1,-1), which is dist 2.

So the cells for ring 1 are: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8

Then what about ( -1,-1)? it's not in ring 1; it's in ring 2.

And (0,-1) is 7, so 6 is not yet assigned.

In the sequence, after 5 at (-1,0), it goes to 6 at (-1,-1)? but (-1,-1) is dist 2, so not adjacent if we are in ring 1.

From (-1,0)=5, adjacent cells: (0,0):1 occupied, ( -2,0) not, ( -1,1):4 occupied, ( -1,-1): not occupied, (0,-1): not occupied, ( -2,1) not.

So can go to ( -1,-1) or (0,-1).

In the diagram, below 5 is 6 at (-1,-1), so probably to ( -1,-1)=6

But then dist from 5 to 6 is 1, but 6 is at dist 2 from center, so it's the start of ring 2.

So for ring 1, it has only 5 cells so far? No, we have 2,3,4,5, and then 6 is in ring 2.

But we need 6 cells for ring 1.

Perhaps (0,-1) is in ring 1, but in diagram it's 7, so perhaps the order is 1,2,3,4,5, then 6 at (0,-1)? but in diagram (0,-1) is 7, and (-1,-1) is 6.

So let's accept that the spiral has 1, then 2,3,4,5,6 at (-1,-1), then 7 at (0,-1), then 8 at (1,-1), then 9 at (2,0), etc.

So for n=2026, find its ring and position.

First, find the ring k such that the first number of ring k is a_k, and a_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1? Let's see.

Total cells up to ring k-1 is 1 + 3(k-1)k/2 *2? Earlier, number of cells within distance k-1 is 1 + 3(k-1)k

For distance < k, i.e., dist <= k-1, number of cells is 1 + 3(k-1)k

For example, dist < 1: only (0,0), 1 cell.

Dist < 2: dist <=1, cells with max| q|,|r|,|s| <2, i.e. <=1, which is 1 + 6 =7 cells.

1 + 3*1*2 =1+6=7, yes.

Dist < 3: dist <=2, cells with max <=2, number 1 + 6 + 12 =19, and 1 + 3*2*3 =1+18=19, yes.

So within dist < k, number of cells is 1 + 3k(k-1)

Then the first cell of ring k (dist k) is b_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) +1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=1: 2 + 3*1*0 =2, good.

k=2: 2 + 3*2*1 =2+6=8, and in our sequence, ring 2 starts at 8 at (1,-1)? But in diagram, 8 is at (1,-1), and 6 and 7 are before, but 6 and 7 are at dist 2? Let's calculate dist for each cell.

 (0,0): max(0,0,0)=0, dist 0

 (1,0): max(1,0,1)=1, dist 1

 (0,1): max(0,1,1)=1, dist 1

 (-1,1): max(1,1,0)=1, dist 1

 (-1,0): max(1,0,1)=1, dist 1

 (-1,-1): max(1,1,2)=2, dist 2

 (0,-1): max(0,1,1)=1, dist 1

 (1,-1): max(1,1,0)=1, dist 1

So cells with dist 1: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) — that's six cells.

Numbers: 2,3,4,5,7,8

6 is at (-1,-1), dist 2, so in ring 2.

7 is at (0,-1), dist 1, so in ring 1.

So the sequence for ring 1: 2,3,4,5,7,8

But 6 is missing; 6 is in ring 2.

So the order is not by ring; the spiral path is 1 (ring 0), then 2 (dist 1), 3 (dist 1), 4 (dist 1), 5 (dist 1), then 6 (dist 2 at (-1,-1)), then 7 (dist 1 at (0,-1)), then 8 (dist 1 at (1,-1)), then 9 (dist 2 at (2,0)), etc.

So after 5 at (-1,0), it goes to 6 at (-1,-1) (dist 2), then to 7 at (0,-1) (dist 1), then to 8 at (1,-1) (dist 1), then to 9 at (2,0) (dist 2), and so on.

So the ring 1 is not completed before moving to ring 2; it jumps to ring 2 and back.

This is a bit messy, but we can follow the path.

For n=2026, we need to find its coordinates, then its six neighbors, then their numbers, and sum them.

So first, find a way to get the coordinates (q,r) for a given n.

Or find the ring and the position on the ring.

The rings are not filled consecutively; the spiral crosses rings.

From the start:

- n=1: (0,0)

- n=2: (1,0)

- n=3: (0,1)

- n=4: (-1,1)

- n=5: (-1,0)

- n=6: (-1,-1)  // dist 2

- n=7: (0,-1)  // dist 1

- n=8: (1,-1)  // dist 1

- n=9: (2,0)  // dist 2, since max(2,0,2)=2

- n=10: (1,1)  // dist 2, max(1,1,2)=2

- n=11: (0,2)  // dist 2, max(0,2,2)=2

- n=12: (-1,2)  // dist 2, max(1,2,1)=2? | -1|=1, |2|=2, s= -(-1)-2=1-2= -1, |s|=1, max(1,2,1)=2

- n=13: (-2,2)  // dist 3? max(2,2,0)=2, dist 2

- n=14: (-2,1)  // dist 2, max(2,1,1)=2

- n=15: (-2,0)  // dist 2, max(2,0,2)=2

- n=16: (-2,-1)  // dist 2, max(2,1,1)=2

- n=17: (-1,-1)  // but (-1,-1) is already n=6, occupied.

At n=16 at (-2,-1), next should be to (-1,-1), but occupied by 6, so must turn to (0,-2) or (-2,-2), etc.

Probably to (-1,-2) or (0,-2).

In standard, after (-2,-1), it might go to (-1,-2) or to (-2,-2).

Assume it goes to (-1,-2) =17

Then to (0,-2)=18

Then to (1,-2)=19

Then to (2,-1)=20? or (2,-2)

And so on.

For n=2026, we need to find its position.

To do that, find the ring k such that b_k ≤ n < b_{k+1}, where b_k is the first number of ring k.

But from above, the rings are mixed, but actually, the distance k corresponds to the ring, and the first number with dist k is when the spiral reaches it.

From the total number, the dist k first appears when n = 2 + 3k(k-1) for k>=2? For k=1, first at n=2

For k=2, first at n=6 (since 6 is at dist 2)

For k=3, first at n=20 or something.

Calculate the n for which dist first appears.

 dist 0: n=1

 dist 1: n=2

 dist 2: n=6

 dist 3: let's say at n=20, as earlier for ring 3 start.

In general, the first n with dist k is b_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) +1 = 2 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1? For k=1: 2+0=2, good.

k=2: 2+3*2*1=2+6=8, but in our sequence, first dist 2 is n=6 at (-1,-1), which is before 8.

6 is dist 2, and it's before 7 and 8 which are dist 1.

So not sequential.

The number of cells with dist < k is c_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) as before.

For example, dist < 1: c_1 = 1 (only dist 0)

 dist < 2: c_2 = 1 + 3*1*2 =7? But cells with dist <2, i.e. dist 0 or 1, number 1 + 6 =7, yes.

 dist < 3: c_3 = 1 + 3*2*3 =1+18=19, cells with dist<3, i.e. dist<=2, number 1+6+12=19, yes.

Then the number of cells with dist = k is d_k = c_{k+1} - c_k = [1 + 3(k+1)k] - [1 + 3k(k-1)] = 3k(k+1) - 3k(k-1) = 3k[(k+1)-(k-1)] = 3k*2 = 6k, as expected.

Now, the spiral fills cells in order of increasing dist, but within the same dist, in some order, but in this case, it fills cells of different dists interleaved.

In this particular spiral, it fills all cells in a specific path that may have cells of different dists at the same time, but in this case, from n=1 to 5, all dist 0 or 1, then n=6 dist 2, n=7 dist 1, n=8 dist 1, n=9 dist 2, etc.

To find the coordinates for n, we can simulate or find a formula.

Notice that the dist increases, but not monotonically for the ring.

We can determine for each n the dist, and then the position on the "layer".

Since the grid is symmetric, and for large n, the dist is approximately sqrt(n/3) or something, but for exact, better to find k such that c_k < n ≤ c_{k+1}, then dist = k, since c_k is number with dist < k, so for n > c_k, dist >= k, and if n ≤ c_{k+1}, dist <= k, so dist = k.

c_k = 1 + 3k(k-1)

c_{k+1} = 1 + 3(k+1)k

So for given n, find k such that c_k < n ≤ c_{k+1}

i.e. 1 + 3k(k-1) < n ≤ 1 + 3k(k+1)

For example, n=1: c_0 = 1 (dist<0? usually k starts from 1, but for k=0, c_0 = number with dist<0, which is 0, then c_1 =1, so for n=1, 0 < 1 ≤ 1, so dist=0? but c_1 =1, dist<1, so dist=0.

n=2: c_1=1 < 2 ≤ c_2=7, so dist=1

n=3: 1<3≤7, dist=1

...
n=6: 1<6≤7, dist=1? but earlier we have n=6 at dist 2, contradiction.

c_2 =1 + 3*1*2=7, c_1=1, so for n=6, c_1=1 <6≤ c_2=7, so dist=1, but we know (-1,-1) has dist 2.

Mistake in dist calculation or in c_k.

c_k = number with dist < k, so for dist < 2, cells with max| q|,|r|,|s| <2, i.e. max <=1, which includes dist 0 and 1, 1+6=7 cells.

Cell with dist 2 has max=2, so not included in dist<2.

For n=6, if it is at dist 2, but in the filling, it is filled before some dist 1 cells, but according to the dist, it should be that when n=6, it is the 6th cell, but cells with dist 0 or 1 are only 7 cells: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8? 6 is not among them; 6 is at dist 2, so it should be after.

In the sequence, after n=5 at (-1,0) dist 1, next is n=6 at (-1,-1) dist 2, then n=7 at (0,-1) dist 1, etc.

So the cell n=6 is the 6th cell, but the cells with dist <=1 are 7 cells, so when n=6, there are cells with dist 1 not yet filled, like (0,-1) and (1,-1), so n=6 is not in dist 1; it is in dist 2.

For n=6, c_k for dist< k.

 dist<1: 1 cell (dist 0)

 dist<2: 7 cells (dist 0 and 1)

 dist<3: 19 cells (dist 0,1,2)

For n=6, dist<1:1 <6, dist<2:7>=6, so dist >=2 and dist <2? dist<2 means dist<=1, so if dist<2 is 7, and n=6 ≤7, then dist<2, so dist<=1.

But we have n=6 at dist 2, so contradiction.

Unless the cell at (-1,-1) has dist 1, but max(|-1|,|-1|,|2|)=2, so dist 1 only if we use a different metric.

Perhaps in this grid, the distance is not the hex distance, but something else.

Perhaps the "dist" for the ring is the Manhattan distance or something.

Perhaps for the spiral, the ring is defined by the step in the spiral, not by geometric distance.

In that case, for the spiral, the ring k has 6k cells for k>=1, with ring 0:1 cell.

Then for k=1: cells 2 to 7

k=2: cells 8 to 19

k=3: 20 to 37, etc.

Then for n=2026, find k such that the total up to ring k-1 < n ≤ total up to ring k.

Total up to ring m is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m 6i = 1 + 6* \frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 1 + 3m(m+1)

For m=0:1

m=1:1+6=7

m=2:7+12=19

m=3:19+18=37

m=4:37+24=61

 etc.

So for n=2026, find m such that 3m(m+1) +1 < 2026 ≤ 3(m+1)(m+2) +1

Solve 3m^2 +3m +1 < 2026 ≤ 3(m+1)(m+2) +1 = 3(m^2+3m+2) +1 = 3m^2+9m+6+1=3m^2+9m+7

So first, 3m^2 +3m +1 < 2026

3m^2 +3m < 2025

m^2 +m < 675

m(m+1) < 675

m≈25, since 25*26=650<675, 26*27=702>675, so m=25

Then check: for m=25, total up to ring 25: 1 + 3*25*26 =1+3*650=1+1950=1951

Then ring 26 has 6*26=156 cells, so up to ring 26: 1951+156=2107

Since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107, so n=2026 is in ring 26.

Ring k has 6k cells, so for k=26, cells from 1952 to 1951+156=2107.

First number of ring k is b_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1? For k=1:1+0=1, but should be 2.

 b_k = total up to ring k-1 +1 = [1 + 3(k-1)k] +1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=1:2+0=2

k=2:2+6=8

k=3:2+18=20, as before.

For k=26, b_26 = 2 + 3*26*25 =2+3*650=2+1950=1952

So n=2026 is in ring 26, and is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th cell in the ring? 2026 - 1951 =75, but since the first cell is 1952, so the index in the ring is n - b_k +1 = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 75

So the 75th cell in ring 26.

Ring k has 6k cells, divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are usually in order: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, or something.

For ring k, it starts at a particular cell and moves in directions.

For example, for k=1: starts at (1,0)=2, then moves northwest to (0,1)=3, then west to (-1,1)=4, then southwest to (-1,0)=5, then south to (-1,-1)=6, then southeast to (0,-1)=7, but in our case for k=1, it has only 6 cells, but here 7 cells, so for k=1, it has 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7 at (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1) , but (1,-1) is missing, and in our earlier, for k=1, we have 2,3,4,5,7,8, with 6 at dist 2.

So perhaps the starting point is different.

For this spiral, the starting point for ring k is at (k,0) for k>=1, but for k=1: (1,0)=2

 for k=2: (2,0)=9 in diagram, but 8 is before at (1,-1)

Perhaps start at (k,1-k) or something.

For k=1: (1,1-1)=(1,0)=2, good.

 for k=2: (2,1-2)=(2,-1)

 in diagram, (2,-1) is not assigned, but 8 is at (1,-1), 9 at (2,0)

Perhaps (k-1,1-k) or (k, -k) .

Assume that for ring k, it starts at (k,0) for k even or something.

From the path, for ring k, the first cell is at (k,0) if k>0, but for k=2, (2,0)=9, but 8 is before.

Perhaps the cell (1,-1) is the last cell of ring 1, but ring 1 has only 6 cells, and we have 7 cells up to 7, but 8 is extra.

Let's list the cells up to n=16:

 n  q  r  dist
1 0 0 0
2 1 0 1
3 0 1 1
4 -1 1 1
5 -1 0 1
6 -1 -1 2
7 0 -1 1
8 1 -1 1
9 2 0 2
10 1 1 2
11 0 2 2
12 -1 2 2
13 -2 2 2
14 -2 1 2
15 -2 0 2
16 -2 -1 2
 then 17 at (-1,-2) or (-2,-2), etc.

So at n=8, we have (1,-1)=8, dist 1, and n=9 (2,0)=9, dist 2.

For ring 2, cells from n=6 to n=19? but n=6 at dist 2, n=7,8 at dist 1, so not.

Perhaps the "ring" for the spiral is different.

Perhaps for the purpose of finding neighbors, we can find the coordinates of n=2026, then its neighbors' coordinates, then find their numbers.

So need a function from n to (q,r).

Since the spiral is regular, we can find for each n the (q,r).

From the sequence, the spiral moves in directions: after start, it moves in 6 directions in order, with lengths increasing.

In many spirals, the number of steps in each direction increases by 1 every two turns, but for hex, it might be different.

From the path:

From n=1 to 2: move east 1 step
2 to 3: move northwest 1 step
3 to 4: move west 1 step
4 to 5: move south 1 step
5 to 6: move south 1 step? from (-1,0) to (-1,-1), south
6 to 7: move east 1 step to (0,-1)
7 to 8: move east 1 step to (1,-1)
8 to 9: move northeast 1 step to (2,0)? but from (1,-1) to (2,0), dq=1, dr=1, so northeast
9 to 10: move northwest 1 step to (1,1)  // dq= -1, dr=0? from (2,0) to (1,1), dq= -1, dr=1, so northwest
10 to 11: move west 1 step to (0,2)  // dq= -1, dr=1? from (1,1) to (0,2), dq= -1, dr=1, same as northwest? or west if r changes.

In axial coordinates, from (1,1) to (0,2): if r is north, then decreasing q, increasing r, which is northwest.

But previously from 8 to 9: (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, northeast.

Then 9 to 10: (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest.

Then 10 to 11: (1,1) to (0,2): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest again.

Then 11 to 12: (0,2) to (-1,2): dq= -1, dr=0, west
12 to 13: (-1,2) to (-2,2): dq= -1, dr=0, west
13 to 14: (-2,2) to (-2,1): dq=0, dr= -1, south
14 to 15: (-2,1) to (-2,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south
15 to 16: (-2,0) to (-2,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, south
16 to 17: say to (-1,-1) but occupied, or to (-2,-2) or (-1,-2)

Probably to (-1,-2) or (-2,-2).

Assume to (-1,-2) =17 ( dq=1, dr= -1, southeast)
 then to (0,-2)=18 ( dq=1, dr=0, east)
 then to (1,-2)=19 ( east)
 then to (2,-1)=20 ( northeast or east)

And so on.

To find a general formula, we can see that the spiral has arms, and for each "layer", the step size increases.

Notice that after the initial, for each "loop", the number of steps in each direction is constant for that loop.

For example, from n=2 to n=8: from 2 to 3:1 step nw, 3 to 4:1 step w, 4 to 5:1 step s, 5 to 6:1 step s, 6 to 7:1 step e, 7 to 8:1 step e, so 2 steps in some directions.

Then from 8 to 9:1 step ne, 9 to 10:1 step nw, 10 to 11:1 step nw, 11 to 12:1 step w, 12 to 13:1 step w, 13 to 14:1 step s, 14 to 15:1 step s, 15 to 16:1 step s, then from 16 to 17: say 1 step se, etc.

So the step size is increasing.

In general, for the m-th "leg", the number of steps is floor((m+1)/2) or something.

We can use the fact that the ring number can be found from the total number, and then the position in the ring determines the cell.

For n=2026, from earlier calculation with the ring definition by the spiral ring, not geometric dist.

So assume that the spiral has rings: ring 0: n=1

 ring 1: n=2 to 7 (6 cells)

 ring 2: n=8 to 19 (12 cells)

 ring 3: n=20 to 37 (18 cells)

 etc.

For n=2026, find k such that the total up to ring k-1 < n ≤ total up to ring k.

Total up to ring m is s_m = 1 + 3m(m+1) as before.

s_m = 1 + 3m(m+1)

s_0 =1

s_1 =1+3*1*2=7

s_2=1+3*2*3=1+18=19

s_3=1+3*3*4=1+36=37

s_4=1+3*4*5=1+60=61

Now solve s_{k-1} < n ≤ s_k

s_k = 1 + 3k(k+1)

s_{k-1} = 1 + 3(k-1)k

So 1 + 3k(k-1) < n ≤ 1 + 3k(k+1)

For n=2026, solve 1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026

3k^2 +3k +1 ≥ 2026

3k^2 +3k -2025 ≥0

k^2 +k -675 ≥0

k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704>2701, so sqrt(2701)≈51.96, so k ≥ [ -1 +51.96]/2 =50.96/2=25.48, so k≥26

For k=26, s_26 = 1 + 3*26*27 =1+3*702=1+2106=2107 ≥2026

s_{25} = 1 + 3*25*26 =1+3*650=1+1950=1951 <2026

So n=2026 is in ring k=26.

First number of ring 26 is b_26 = s_{25} +1 = 1952

Last number s_26=2107

Number of cells in ring 26 is 6*26=156

So n=2026 is the (2026 - 1951) =75th cell in the ring? 2026 - 1951 =75, but since the first cell is 1952, so the index in the ring is n - b_26 +1 = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 75

So position p = 75 in ring 26.

Ring k has 6 sides, each with k cells.

For k=26, each side has 26 cells.

The sides are in order: usually for hexagonal spiral, the sides are: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast.

The starting cell for ring k is at (k,0) for k>=1.

For example, k=1: (1,0)=2, good.

k=2: (2,0)=8? but in our earlier, for k=2, first cell is 8 at (1,-1), not (2,0).

For k=2, (2,0)=9, which is the second cell.

So perhaps the start is at (k,1-k) or something.

For k=1: (1,0) good.

k=2: (2,1-2)=(2,-1)

 in diagram, (2,-1) is not assigned; 8 is at (1,-1), 9 at (2,0)

So (1,-1) for k=2.

Perhaps (k-1,1-k) for k>=2.

For k=2: (1,1-2)=(1,-1)=8, good.

k=3: (2,1-3)=(2,-2)

 in our sequence, for k=3, first cell is 20, at (2,-2) or something.

From earlier, after n=16 at (-2,-1), then to 17 at (-1,-2), 18 at (0,-2), 19 at (1,-2), 20 at (2,-2), so yes, (2,-2)=20, good.

So starting cell for ring k is at (k-1,1-k) for k>=1, with the understanding that for k=1, (0,0) but it should be (1,0), so perhaps (k,0) for k=1, but for k>1, (k-1,1-k)

General formula: for k>=1, start at (k,0) if k=1, else (k-1,1-k)

For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,-1)

k=3: (2,-2)

k=4: (3,-3) etc.

So in general, for k>=1, start at (k,0) for k=1, (k-1,1-k) for k>1, which can be written as ( \min(k, k-1) , \max(0,1-k) ) but perhaps better to say for k>=1, the start cell is ( floor((k+1)/2) * something, but let's see the coordinates.

For k, start at (a_k, b_k) with a_k = k if k=1, else k-1, b_k = 0 if k=1, else 1-k

 a_k = k for k=1, k-1 for k>1

 b_k = 0 for k=1, 1-k for k>1

For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,-1)

k=3: (2,-2)

k=4: (3,-3)

 so a_k = k for k=1, k-1 for k>1, which is floor((2k-1)/2) or something, but simply a_k = k - [k>1] where [ ] is Iverson bracket, or a_k = k for k=1, else k-1.

 b_k = 0 for k=1, - (k-1) for k>1, so b_k = - (k-1) for k>=2, and for k=1, 0 = -0, so b_k = - (k-1) for all k>=1.

 a_k = k if k=1, k-1 if k>1, which is not smooth, but a_k = ceil(k/2) *2 -1 or something, for k=1:1, k=2:1, k=3:2, k=4:3, so a_k = floor((2k-1)/2) = k - 0.5 floor, but for integer, a_k = floor((2k-1)/2) for k>=1: k=1: floor(1/2)=0? not.

 a_k = k - 1 for k>=2, 1 for k=1, so a_k = k - [k>1] where [k>1] is 1 if k>1, 0 otherwise.

Similarly, b_k = - (k-1)

So start cell: ( k - [k>1] , -(k-1) )

From start cell, the ring is traversed in 6 directions, each with k steps.

The directions are: for the first side, from start, it moves in the "east" direction or "northeast", etc.

For k=1: start at (1,0), then moves northwest to (0,1)=3

But for a ring, it should have 6 sides, but k=1 has only 6 cells, so each "side" has 1 cell, but in practice, it moves to different directions.

For k=1: from (1,0) to (0,1) : northwest

 then to (-1,1) : west
 then to (-1,0) : southwest? or south
 etc.

For general k, the first move is in the direction that is not back.

Typically, from the start, it moves in the " tangent" direction.

For this spiral, from the start cell, it always moves in the "northeast" direction for the first side.

For k=1: from (1,0) to (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, which is northwest in our coord, but if we define the directions properly.

Define the move directions.

In axial coordinates, the six directions are:
- east: (q+1,r)
- west: (q-1,r)
- northeast: (q,r+1)
- southwest: (q,r-1)
- northwest: (q-1,r+1)
- southeast: (q+1,r-1)

For example, from (0,0):
- e: (1,0)
- w: (-1,0)
- ne: (0,1)
- sw: (0,-1)
- nw: (-1,1)
- se: (1,-1)

In the spiral for ring k, from start cell, it moves in a specific sequence of directions.

For k=1: start at (1,0)
 then move to (0,1): which is northwest (nw)
 then to (-1,1): west (w)
 then to (-1,0): southwest (sw)
 then to (-1,-1): south? but south is sw or what; from (-1,0) to (-1,-1): if south is (q,r-1), so sw in some systems, but in this, (q,r-1) is southwest.
In our list, from (-1,0) to (-1,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, so southwest (sw)
 then to (0,-1): east (e) or southeast; from (-1,-1) to (0,-1): dq=1, dr=0, so east (e)
 then to (1,-1): east (e) again, but for k=1, only 6 cells, so stops at (0,-1)=7, and (1,-1) is start of ring 2.

For ring 2: start at (1,-1)=8
 then move to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, which is southeast? or northeast; from (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, which is not a basic direction; the basic directions are changes by (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1)

From (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, which is not one of the six; it would be (1,1) in cube coords, but in axial, it's not a neighbor; it's two steps away.

This is the problem; in the move from 8 to 9, it's not to an adjacent cell in the grid; it's skipping or something, but in the grid, cells are adjacent, so probably the move is to an adjacent cell, but in our earlier calculation, from (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent.

Unless the grid is not with this coordinate system.

Perhaps for the move, from (1,-1) to (2,-1) first, but in diagram, it's not; it goes directly to (2,0).

Perhaps the cell (2,0) is adjacent to (1,-1) in the hex grid, but in standard axial coordinates, it is not; the neighbors are only at Manhattan distance 1 in the grid graph.

Perhaps this is a different orientation.

Perhaps the r coordinate is defined differently.

Another idea: perhaps the rows are not r= constant, but something else.

Perhaps use offset coordinates.

But to save time, for n=2026 in ring 26, position 75, and we can assume the starting cell and the direction of movement.

For ring k, start at (a_k, b_k) = (k - [k>1], -(k-1)) as above.

For k=26, a_k = 26 -1 =25 (since k>1), b_k = - (26-1) = -25

So start at (25, -25)

Then the first move is in the "northeast" direction, but in our case, for k=2, from (1,-1) to (2,0), which is dq=1, dr=1, so if we define northeast as (q+1,r+1), then yes, but in standard, it's not a basic direction, but in this spiral, it does move in that direction, so perhaps for this grid, the move to (q+1,r+1) is allowed, but then it's not a grid move; it's diagonal, but in hex grid, there are no diagonals; only orthogonal in three directions.

Perhaps in this spiral, the cells are not on a hex grid with only orthogonal moves; but the problem says "hexagonal grid", so probably it is, and we have a mistake in the move.

Perhaps from (1,-1) to (2,0) is not a direct move; perhaps it goes through (1,0) or something, but not.

Perhaps for the ring, the cells are filled by moving in the directions along the ring, and for ring k, the first side is in the "east" direction, but for k=2, from (1,-1), if it moves east to (2,-1), then to (3,-1), etc, but in diagram, it goes to (2,0).

So perhaps the first side is in the "northeast" direction.

Assume that for ring k, from start cell, it moves in the direction of (1,1) for k steps, then (0,1) for k steps, then (-1,0) for k steps, then (-1,-1) for k steps, then (0,-1) for k steps, then (1,0) for k steps, or something.

For example, for k=2: start at (1,-1)

 move in (1,1) direction: to (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) first cell of side

 then to (2+1,0+1)=(3,1) second cell

 but in diagram, after (2,0)=9, to (1,1)=10, not (3,1)

 so not.

 move in (0,1) direction: from (1,-1) to (1,0), but occupied.

Perhaps ( -1,1) or something.

Let's list the moves for the first few.

For ring 2: start at (1,-1)=8

 then to (2,0)=9: dq=1, dr=1

 then to (1,1)=10: dq= -1, dr=1

 then to (0,2)=11: dq= -1, dr=1

 then to (-1,2)=12: dq= -1, dr=0

 then to (-2,2)=13: dq= -1, dr=0

 then to (-2,1)=14: dq=0, dr= -1

 then to (-2,0)=15: dq=0, dr= -1

 then to (-2,-1)=16: dq=0, dr= -1

 then to (-1,-2)=17: dq=1, dr= -1

 then to (0,-2)=18: dq=1, dr=0

 then to (1,-2)=19: dq=1, dr=0

 then to (2,-1)=20: dq=1, dr=1? or (2,-2) 

In our earlier assumption, after (1,-2), to (2,-1) or (2,-2).

If to (2,-1)=20, then dq=1, dr=1

 then to (3,0)=21, etc.

For k=2, 12 cells, so from 8 to 19, 12 cells.

From (1,-1) to (2,0) : move (1,1)

 then to (1,1) : move (-1,1)? dq= -1, dr=1

 then to (0,2) : move (-1,1) again

 then to (-1,2) : move (-1,0)  dq= -1, dr=0

 then to (-2,2) : move (-1,0)

 then to (-2,1) : move (0,-1)

 then to (-2,0) : move (0,-1)

 then to (-2,-1) : move (0,-1)

 then to (-1,-2) : move (1,-1)  dq=1, dr= -1

 then to (0,-2) : move (1,0)  dq=1, dr=0

 then to (1,-2) : move (1,0)

 then to (2,-1) : move (1,1)  dq=1, dr=1

So the move vectors for the sides are: first side: (1,1) for 2 steps
 second side: (-1,1) for 2 steps
 third side: (-1,0) for 2 steps
 fourth side: (0,-1) for 2 steps
 fifth side: (1,-1) for 2 steps
 sixth side: (1,0) for 2 steps

And after sixth side, it should be back, but in this case, after (1,-2) to (2,-1), which is not the start, but for the next ring.

For each side, the number of steps is k=2.

The directions are in order: (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (1,0)

Note that (1,0) is east, (0,1) is northeast? but here we have (1,1), etc.

For general k, the same directions, with k steps per side.

For k=1: only 1 step per side, but there are 6 sides, but only 6 cells, so ok.

For k=1: start at (1,0)
 move (1,1): to (1+1,0+1)=(2,1)
 but in diagram, after 2 is 3 at (0,1), not (2,1)

 so not the same.

For k=1, it uses different directions.

Perhaps the directions are relative to the current position, but usually in spirals, the directions are absolute.

Perhaps for each ring, the first direction is based on the ring number.

To simplify, for large k, it doesn't matter, and for k=26, p=75, we can determine the cell.

For ring k, with position p (1 to 6k), the cell can be found by determining which side and the step on the side.

The sides are numbered 0 to 5, each with k cells.

Side 0: cells 1 to k
 side 1: k+1 to 2k
 side 2: 2k+1 to 3k
 side 3: 3k+1 to 4k
 side 4: 4k+1 to 5k
 side 5: 5k+1 to 6k

For each side, the move direction is constant.

From the start cell, for side 0, move in direction D0 for k steps (but each step to a new cell, so after s steps on a side, you have moved s steps in that direction from the start of the side).

For side 0: move in direction (1,1)
 side 1: (-1,1)
 side 2: (-1,0)
 side 3: (0,-1)
 side 4: (1,-1)
 side 5: (1,0)

For k=2: start at (1,-1)

 side 0 (p=1,2): move (1,1)
 for p=1: first cell: start + 0* (1,1) = (1,-1) cell 8
 for p=2: start + 1* (1,1) = (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) cell 9

 side 1 (p=3,4): move (-1,1)
 start of side 1: after side 0, at (2,0)
 for p=3: (2,0) + 0* (-1,1) = (2,0) but cell 9, already, so probably the start of the side is the cell after the turn, so for side s, the first cell is at the start cell of the side, not including the previous end.

In spiral, when you finish a side, you are at a corner, then you turn and move to the next side.

For side 0, after k steps, you are at start + k * D0

Then for side 1, you start from there and move in D1 for k steps, and so on.

For k=2: start at S = (1,-1)

 side 0: move D0=(1,1) for 2 steps:
 after 1 step: S + 1* (1,1) = (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) cell 9
 after 2 steps: S + 2* (1,1) = (1+2,-1+2)=(3,1) cell 10? but in diagram, after 9 is 10 at (1,1), not (3,1)

 so not.

Perhaps the move is to the cell, so for each step, you add the vector to get to the next cell.

For side 0: from S, first cell is S itself, then move to S + D0, then S +2D0, etc.

For k=2, side 0: cells: p=1: S = (1,-1) cell 8
 p=2: S + (1,1) = (2,0) cell 9
 then side 1: start at (2,0)
 cells: p=3: (2,0) cell 9 again, conflict.

So the cells are at S + s * D0 for s=0 to k-1 for side 0, then for side 1, at (S + k*D0) + s * D1 for s=0 to k-1, and so on.

For k=2: S = (1,-1)
 side 0: s=0: (1,-1) cell 8
 s=1: (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) cell 9
 then side 1: start at S +2* (1,1) = (1+2,-1+2)=(3,1)
 s=0: (3,1) cell 10? but in diagram cell 10 is at (1,1), not (3,1)

 so not matching.

For side 1, after side 0, you are at (2,0), and you move in D1= (-1,1), so cells: s=0: (2,0) cell 9 (but already used)
 s=1: (2-1,0+1)=(1,1) cell 10, good.

So for side 1, s=0: the cell after the turn, which is the same as the last cell of previous side, but that cell is already assigned, so for side s, the cells are from index s*k+1 to (s+1)*k, and the cell for step s on side t is at a formula.

For side t, cell index in side is s (0 to k-1), and the cell is start + sum of previous direction vectors * k + s * D_t

For example, for ring k, start at S_k

Then for side 0: cells at S_k + s * D0 for s=0 to k-1

For side 1: cells at S_k + k * D0 + s * D1 for s=0 to k-1

For side 2: S_k + k*D0 + k*D1 + s*D2 for s=0 to k-1

And so on.

For k=2: S= (1,-1)
 D0=(1,1)
 D1=(-1,1)
 D2=(-1,0)
 etc.

Side 0: s=0: S +0*D0 = (1,-1) cell 8
 s=1: S +1*D0 = (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) cell 9

Side 1: s=0: S +2*D0 +0*D1 = (1+2*1,-1+2*1)=(3,1) cell 10? but should be (1,1)

 not.

 S + k*D0 + s*D1 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) + s* (-1,1) = (1+2, -1+2) + s*(-1,1) = (3,1) + s*(-1,1)

 s=0: (3,1) not (1,1)

 so not.

Perhaps the directions are applied in order, but the start is included.

For side t, the cell is S_k + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k * D_i + s * D_t for s=0 to k-1

For t=0: sum i=0 to -1 empty, so S_k + s*D0

For t=1: S_k + k*D0 + s*D1

Same as above.

Perhaps the vector sum is cumulative.

For the cell at side t, step s, the cell is S_k + s * D_t + k * sum_{i=0}^{t-1} D_i

For t=0: S_k + s*D0 + 0

 t=1: S_k + s*D1 + k*D0

 etc.

For k=2, t=1, s=0: S + 0*D1 + 2*D0 = (1,-1) + 0 + 2*(1,1) = (1+2, -1+2)=(3,1) same.

So not working.

Perhaps for this spiral, the directions are different.

From the move sequence, for each side, the direction is constant, and for ring k, the directions are:
- first side: northeast: (0,1) or (1,1)? in our case for k=2, from (1,-1) to (2,0): which is (1,1) in change.

Assume D0 = (1,1)
 D1 = (-1,1)
 D2 = (-1,0)
 D3 = (0,-1)
 D4 = (1,-1)
 D5 = (1,0)

For k=2:
 start S= (1,-1)
 side 0: move D0=(1,1)
 cell 8: S = (1,-1)
 cell 9: S + D0 = (2,0)

 side 1: start at S + D0 = (2,0)  (since for s=0 to k-1, but for s=0, it should be the first cell of the side, but in this case, (2,0) is already cell 9, so for side 1, s=0: (2,0) + 0*D1 = (2,0) but already used, so perhaps the start of side 1 is after the turn, so cell for side 1 s=0 is S + D0 + D1 or something.

In standard, after finishing side 0, you are at S + k * D0, then for side 1, you move from there in D1, so the first cell of side 1 is S + k*D0 + D1, but for k=2, S +2*D0 + D1 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) + (-1,1) = (1+2-1, -1+2+1)=(2,2) cell 10, but should be (1,1)

 not.

 S + k*D0 + 0*D1 = (1+2, -1+2)=(3,1) not.

Perhaps for side t, the cell is S_k + s * D_t + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} (k * D_i) but for t=0, sum empty, S_k + s*D0

 t=1: S_k + s*D1 + k*D0

 same as before.

Perhaps the sum is for the number of steps.

Let's calculate the coordinate for the end of each side.

For ring k, after side t, you are at S_k + k * sum_{i=0}^{t} D_i

For example, for k=2, S= (1,-1)
 after side 0 (t=0): S + k * D0 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) = (3,1)
 after side 1 (t=1): S + k*(D0 + D1) = (1,-1) +2*[(1,1)+(-1,1)] = (1,-1) +2*(0,2) = (1,-1) + (0,4) = (1,3)
 not matching.

 S + sum_{i=0}^{t} k * D_i

 after side 0: S + k*D0 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) = (3,1)
 after side 1: S + k*(D0 + D1) = (1,-1) +2*(0,2) = (1,3)

 but in the path, after side 1, at (1,1) for cell 10, then to (0,2), etc.

Perhaps it's cumulative from beginning.

For cell at side t, step s, the cell is S_k + s * D_t + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k * D_i

For t=0: S_k + s*D0
 t=1: S_k + s*D1 + k*D0
 etc.

For k=2, t=0, s=0: S +0*D0 = (1,-1) cell 8
 s=1: S +1*D0 = (2,0) cell 9
 t=1, s=0: S +0*D1 +2*D0 = (1,-1) +0 +2*(1,1) = (3,1) cell 10? should be (1,1)

 not.

 S_k + s*D_t + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} (k * D_i)

 same thing.

Perhaps the directions are not the same for all k, or perhaps for this spiral, the first side is in the "east" direction for all k.

For k=1: from (1,0) move northwest to (0,1), not east.

For k=2: from (1,-1) move to (2,0), not east.

So not.

Perhaps the direction depends on k mod 6 or something.

To resolve, for n=2026, ring k=26, p=75, and since k is large, and we need the neighbors, perhaps the neighbors are at distance 1 in the grid, so once we have (q,r) for n, we can find the six adjacent cells, then find their numbers, but to do that, we need to know the number for given (q,r), which requires knowing the filling order.

Perhaps for large n, the number is approximately proportional to the area, but for exact, we need the formula.

Perhaps the filling is by distance from center, and within the same distance, by angle or something, but in this case, it's not.

Another idea: perhaps the spiral is such that it always moves to the adjacent cell with smallest number not used, but that would be a different path.

Perhaps for this problem, since we need the sum of neighbors, and for large n, the neighbors are n±1, n±k, etc, but in this case, for example at n=1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

For n=2, neighbors 1,3,9,10,8,7, sum 1+3+9+10+8+7=38

 etc.

For n=2026, it might be similar to other cells in the same ring.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors is approximately 6* n, since each neighbor is close to n, but not exactly.

Perhaps for cells not on the edge, the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and four others at different rings.

But to be precise, we need to find the position.

Let's assume that for ring k, with position p, the cell is given by a formula.

From the start cell S_k = (a_k, b_k) = (k - [k>1], -(k-1)) = for k=26, (25, -25)

Then the first side is in direction (1,1) for k steps.

So for side 0, cells at S_k + s * (1,1) for s=0 to k-1

For side 1, cells at S_k + k*(1,1) + s * (-1,1) for s=0 to k-1

For side 2: S_k + k*(1,1) + k*(-1,1) + s * (-1,0) = S_k + k*(0,2) + s*(-1,0) = S_k + (0,2k) + s*(-1,0)

For side 3: S_k + k*(0,2) + k*(-1,0) + s*(0,-1) = S_k + (-k,2k) + s*(0,-1)

For side 4: S_k + (-k,2k) + k*(0,-1) + s*(1,-1) = S_k + (-k,2k - k) + s*(1,-1) = S_k + (-k,k) + s*(1,-1)

For side 5: S_k + (-k,k) + k*(1,-1) + s*(1,0) = S_k + (-k +k, k -k) + s*(1,0) = S_k + (0,0) + s*(1,0) = S_k + s*(1,0)

For k=2: S= (1,-1)
 side 0: s=0: (1,-1) cell 8
 s=1: (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) cell 9
 side 1: s=0: S +2*(1,1) +0*(-1,1) = (1,-1) + (2,2) + (0,0) = (3,1) cell 10? should be (1,1)

 not.

 S_k + k*D0 + s*D1 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) + s*(-1,1) = (3,1) + s*(-1,1)
 s=0: (3,1)
 s=1: (2,2)

 not (1,1) or (0,2)

 so not matching.

Perhaps the s ranges from 0 to k-1, but the cell for s=0 is the first cell, but in this case it's not correct.

For side 1, the start is after the last cell of side 0, which is S_k + (k-1)*D0, then for side 1, cells at [S_k + (k-1)*D0] + s * D1 for s=1 to k, but usually s=0 to k-1 from the start of the side.

Let's try for side 1: start at S_k + (k) * D0? but for k=2, S +2* (1,1) = (3,1), then cells: s=0: (3,1), s=1: (3-1,1+1)=(2,2) not good.

Start at S_k + (k-1)*D0 = for k=2, S +1*(1,1) = (2,0) which is cell 9, then for side 1, s=0: (2,0) +0*D1 = (2,0) cell 9 again, conflict.

So perhaps the cell for side t, step s is S_k + s * D_t + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} (k * D_i)

 and for s=0, it is S_k + sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k*D_i, which is the start of the side.

For k=2, t=0: s=0: S = (1,-1) cell 8
 s=1: S +1*(1,1) = (2,0) cell 9
 t=1: s=0: S + 2*D0 = (1,-1) +2*(1,1) = (3,1) cell 10? should be (1,1)

 still not.

Unless the directions are different.

For k=2, from (1,-1) to (2,0): D0=(1,1)
 then from (2,0) to (1,1): D1= (-1,1)
 then from (1,1) to (0,2): D1 again? but should be the same direction for the side.

In the move from 9 to 10: (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, so (-1,1)
 from 10 to 11: (1,1) to (0,2): same (-1,1)
 so for side 1, it is move (-1,1) for 2 steps.

Then from 11 to 12: (0,2) to (-1,2): dq= -1, dr=0, so (-1,0)
 from 12 to 13: (-1,2) to (-2,2): same (-1,0)
 so side 2: (-1,0) for 2 steps.

Then side 3: (0,-1) for 2 steps: from (-2,2) to (-2,1): dq=0, dr= -1
 to (-2,0): same
 to (-2,-1): same, but only 2 steps, so to (-2,1) and (-2,0)

In our earlier, from 13 to 14: (-2,2) to (-2,1): (0,-1)
 14 to 15: (-2,1) to (-2,0): (0,-1)
 15 to 16: (-2,0) to (-2,-1): (0,-1) , so 3 steps, but for k=2, should be 2 steps per side, but here side 3 has 3 cells? no, for n=14,15,16, but 14,15,16 are cells, but for side 3, if it starts at n=14, then cells 14,15,16, three cells, but k=2, should be 2 cells per side.

In ring 2, cells 8 to 19, 12 cells, so from n=8 to n=19.

 n=8: (1,-1)
9: (2,0)
10: (1,1)
11: (0,2)
12: (-1,2)
13: (-2,2)
14: (-2,1)
15: (-2,0)
16: (-2,-1)
17: (-1,-2)
18: (0,-2)
19: (1,-2)

So 12 cells.

Now the sides:
- from 8 to 9: (1,-1) to (2,0): move (1,1)
- 9 to 10: (2,0) to (1,1): move (-1,1)
- 10 to 11: (1,1) to (0,2): move (-1,1) same as above
- 11 to 12: (0,2) to (-1,2): move (-1,0)
- 12 to 13: (-1,2) to (-2,2): move (-1,0) same
- 13 to 14: (-2,2) to (-2,1): move (0,-1)
- 14 to 15: (-2,1) to (-2,0): move (0,-1) same
- 15 to 16: (-2,0) to (-2,-1): move (0,-1) same, so three moves in (0,-1)
- 16 to 17: (-2,-1) to (-1,-2): move (1,-1)
- 17 to 18: (-1,-2) to (0,-2): move (1,0)
- 18 to 19: (0,-2) to (1,-2): move (1,0) same

So the number of steps per side is not constant; it has 2 steps for some, 3 for others.

For side after 13: from 13 to 14,15,16, three cells, so three steps.

This is inconsistent.

Perhaps for ring k, the number of cells is 6k, but the side lengths are not all k; perhaps it depends on the direction.

In some spirals, the side length increases.

For this specific spiral, it might be that the move lengths are constant for each " turn", but for simplicity, for n=2026, since it's large, and we need the sum, perhaps the sum is 6*2026 - 6 or something, but let's calculate for a small n.

For example, for n=1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

For n=2, neighbors: from earlier, in diagram, for (1,0): neighbors (0,0)=1, (2,0)=9, (0,1)=3, (1,1)=10, (1,-1)=8, (0,-1)=7

So numbers 1,9,3,10,8,7, sum 1+9+3+10+8+7=38

For n=3 at (0,1): neighbors (0,0)=1, (1,1)=10, (-1,1)=4, (0,2)=11, (-1,2)=12, (0,0) already, wait.

Neighbors of (0,1): (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0), (1,0), (-1,0)

Cells: (1,1)=10, (-1,1)=4, (0,2)=11, (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=5

So numbers 10,4,11,1,2,5, sum 10+4+11+1+2+5=33

For n=6 at (-1,-1): neighbors (-1,0)=5, (-1,-2)=17, (0,-1)=7, (0,-2)=18, (-2,-1)=16, (-2,0)=15

Numbers 5,17,7,18,16,15, sum 5+17+7+18+16+15=78

So different sums.

Perhaps for cells on the edge, the sum is different, but for interior, it might be constant or something.

For n=2026, likely not on the edge, so perhaps the sum is 6*2026 - 6 or 6*2026, but for n=1, sum 27, 6*1=6, not close.

Perhaps the sum is 6 times the average of neighbors, but hard.

Another idea: in many spirals, the neighbors include n-1 and n+1, and then others at n±d for some d.

But in this case, for n=2, neighbors include
