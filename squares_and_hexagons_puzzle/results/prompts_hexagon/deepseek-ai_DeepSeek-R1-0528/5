<think>
The problem involves a spiral on a hexagonal grid with natural numbers. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the example, it starts with 1 in the center, then 2, 3, 4, etc., spiraling outward. Looking at the snippet:

... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, center is 1. Then it goes to 2, probably to the right. Then 3 above it? Let me sketch this.

Assume a hexagonal grid. Each cell has six neighbors. The center is 1. The numbers around it are 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the diagram, around 1 are 2,5,6,7? Let's list the neighbors.

From the diagram:

- Above 1 is probably 3? But in the second row: ... 14 4 3 10 ... and below: 15 5 1 2 9 ... and below that: 16 6 7 8 ...

So, directly above 1 is 3? But 3 is listed above, and 2 is to the right? Let's see the positions.

I am considering assigning coordinates to the hexagons. In a hexagonal grid, we can use axial coordinates or offset coordinates. Perhaps a ring-based approach might be better since it's a spiral.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the numbers are arranged in rings around the center. The center is ring 0, which has one cell: 1.

Then ring 1 has 6 cells: 2 through 7? But 1 to 7 is 7 numbers, center is 1, so first ring should be numbers 2 to 7.

In the diagram, around 1: we have 2,9? No, in the snippet: near 1 are 2,5,6,7? Specifically, from the text: "15 5 1 2 9" so left of 1 is 5? Right is 2? Then below is 6? Above is 3? But 3 is not directly above in the text.

The text has three lines:

Line 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ... so probably cells: 14,4,3,10

Line 2: 15,5,1,2,9

Line 3: 16,6,7,8

And dots indicate continuation.

So, visually, it might be something like:

Row -1: 14, 4, 3, 10

Row 0: 15, 5, 1, 2, 9

Row 1: 16, 6, 7, 8

But in a hexagonal grid, rows are offset. Typically, in hex grids, each row is shifted.

Perhaps row 0: cells x=0,y=0:1

Then neighbors at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) or something. Standard axial coordinates.

Set center at (0,0).

The six neighbors are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) in axial coordinates, but I need to assign numbers.

From the diagram, we see that 1 is at center.

To its right is 2? In row 0: 15,5,1,2,9 so left to right: 15,5,1,2,9 so probably 5 is left, 2 is right, so east is 2.

Then above: in row -1: 14,4,3,10 so above 1 should be around there. Directly above might be 3? But 3 is listed, and 4 is left of it? This is messy.

Notice that below 1 is row 1: 16,6,7,8 so probably 6 is below-left, 7 below, 8 below-right? But 6,7,8 are consecutive.

From the sequence: after 1 is 2, then probably 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,etc.

The spiral starts at 1, then moves to a neighbor. In hexagonal grid, from center, it goes to one direction, say east to 2, then probably northeast to 3, northwest to 4, west to 5, southwest to 6, south to 7, southeast to 8, then next ring.

After 8, it should go to 9,10,etc. In the diagram, after 8 is 9, which is in row 0 to the right of 2? Row 0 has 15,5,1,2,9 so 9 is to the right of 2.

Then row -1 has 14,4,3,10 so 10 is to the right of 3.

Row 1 has 16,6,7,8 so 16 is left of 6.

So let's list the numbers we see:

- Center: 1

- East: 2

- Northeast: ? Above 1 is 3? But in row -1, 3 is there, and 4 is left, 14 left of 4, 10 right of 3.

Perhaps the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops. In this case, from the arrangement, it seems like flat-top hexagons, since rows are horizontal.

Assume flat-top hexagons. Then each hex has neighbors: NE, NW, W, SW, SE, E.

Set 1 at (0,0).

Suppose it moves east to 2 at (1,0).

Then from 2, it could go NE to (1,1) or NW to (1,-1), but typically spirals go counterclockwise or clockwise.

In the diagram, after 2 is 9? But 9 is to the east of 2? In row 0, after 2 is 9, but that would be further east, but then what about 3? 3 is above.

Probably from 2, it goes north to 3.

In flat-top hex, north would be NE or NW? Let's define coordinates.

Set q and r for axial coordinates.

Let center be (0,0).

The six neighbors are:

- (1,0) : E

- (0,1) : NE

- (-1,1) : NW

- (-1,0) : W

- (0,-1) : SW

- (1,-1) : SE

Now, from the diagram, east of 1 is 2, so (1,0) = 2.

West of 1 is 5, since in row 0: 15,5,1,2,9 so 5 is west, so (-1,0) = 5.

Now, above: in row -1, we have 14,4,3,10. Since it's above, probably r-coordinate is different.

For a hex at (q,r), the y-coordinate is proportional to r, but in axial, the sum q+r+s=0 with s=-q-r.

The neighbor at (0,1) is NE, which should be above and right, but in flat-top, NE is up and slightly right.

In the diagram, directly above 1 might be at (0,1)? What number is there? In row -1, which is probably r=1 or r=-1? Let's see the sequence.

After 1 is 2 at (1,0).

Then from 2, it should go to the next number, which is 3. Where is 3? In the diagram, 3 is in row -1, which is above row 0. So if row 0 is r=0, then row -1 might be r=1 or r=-1.

Typically, r increases up or down. Let's assume that r increases upwards.

So row -1 is probably r=1, since it's above.

In row -1: cells at q-values. We have cells: 14,4,3,10. Since it's a hex grid, the row might not be aligned; cells are offset.

For hex at (q,r), the "row" is r, and q ranges.

For r=0: we have cells at q= -2? 15,5,1,2,9. So probably q= -2:15, q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9.

Similarly, for r=1 (row -1): cells at q= -2:14, q=-1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10? But 10 is there, but what about q=2? It's not listed, but dots indicate it continues.

Similarly, r=-1 (row 1): q= -2:16, q=-1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8? But only 16,6,7,8 listed, so q= -2:16, q=-1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8.

Now, the numbers: at (0,0):1

(1,0):2

(-1,0):5

(0,1):3? Since r=1, q=0:3

(-1,1):4? q=-1,r=1:4

(-2,1):14? q=-2,r=1:14

(1,1):10? q=1,r=1:10

Now for r=-1: q=-2:16, q=-1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8

Now, what about (2,0)? In r=0, q=2:9

(2,-1)? Not listed, but probably later numbers.

Now, sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,...

From 1 to 2: east.

2 to 3: should be to a neighbor. Neighbors of 2 at (1,0) are: (2,0),(1,1),(0,1),(0,0),(1,-1),(2,-1)? Standard neighbors: (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)? Let's recall axial coordinates.

In axial coordinates, neighbors of (q,r) are:

- (q+1,r)

- (q,r+1)

- (q-1,r+1)? I think I have it wrong.

Standard axial neighbors: for hex at (q,r), neighbors are:

- (q+1, r)

- (q, r+1)

- (q-1, r)

- (q, r-1)

- (q+1, r-1)? No.

Actually, the six directions:

Let me define:

Direction dq, dr:

E: (1,0)

NE: (0,1) ? But in some systems, NE is (1,-1) or something. I need to be consistent.

In my earlier assignment, for (0,0), neighbors:

(1,0): E

(0,1): NE? But in flat-top, NE might be different.

From the grid, at (1,0)=2, its neighbors should include (0,0)=1, (2,0)=9? But 9 is later, (1,1)=10? (0,1)=3, (1,-1)=? At r=-1,q=1:8? But 8 is 8, which is after 3? Sequence is 1,2,3,... so after 2 is 3.

So from 2 at (1,0), it goes to 3 at (0,1)? But (0,1) is north-west of (1,0)? Let's see the vector: from (1,0) to (0,1): dq=-1, dr=1, which is NW direction.

In flat-top hex, from a cell, moving NW decreases q and increases r.

Now, after 3, next is 4. Where is 4? At (-1,1). From (0,1) to (-1,1): dq=-1, dr=0, which is west.

Then from 4 at (-1,1) to next? Probably 5. 5 is at (-1,0). From (-1,1) to (-1,0): dq=0, dr=-1, which is SW? In flat-top, decreasing r is south, but since q same, it's south-west or south? dq=0, dr=-1: south.

Then from 5 at (-1,0) to next? 6 is at (-1,-1)? But in r=-1, q=-1 is 6. From (-1,0) to (-1,-1): dq=0, dr=-1? Same as before? But direction: dq=0, dr=-1: south.

But previously from 4 to 5 was south, now from 5 to 6 also south? But 6 is at q=-1,r=-1.

From (-1,0) to (-1,-1): same direction? But in spiral, it should turn.

After 5 is 6, but 6 is at (-1,-1)? In the grid, at r=-1,q=-1:6.

From (-1,0) to (-1,-1): vector (0,-1), south.

Then from 6 to 7: 7 is at (0,-1). From (-1,-1) to (0,-1): dq=1, dr=0, which is east? NE? dq=1, dr=0: east.

Then from 7 to 8: 8 is at (1,-1). From (0,-1) to (1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, east again? But should be consecutive.

7 at (0,-1), 8 at (1,-1), so east.

Then from 8 to 9: 9 is at (2,0). From (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, which is NE? Since q increases, r increases.

Then from 9 to 10: 10 is at (1,1). From (2,0) to (1,1): dq=-1, dr=1, NW.

Then from 10 to 11? Not shown, but probably continues.

So the path is: start at (0,0):1

Move E to (1,0):2

Move NW to (0,1):3? Earlier I said from (1,0) to (0,1) is dq=-1,dr=1, which is NW.

But NW is not the typical direction; usually spirals go in a consistent direction, like always clockwise or counterclockwise.

From 2 to 3: NW

3 to 4: W (to (-1,1))

4 to 5: S (to (-1,0))

5 to 6: S (to (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) is SW? From (-1,0) to (-1,-1) is S.

But then 6 to 7: E (to (0,-1))

7 to 8: E (to (1,-1))

8 to 9: NE (to (2,0))

9 to 10: NW (to (1,1))

10 to 11: probably W to (0,1), but (0,1) is already occupied by 3.

Mistake.

After 10 at (1,1), next should be 11. But neighbors: (2,1),(1,2),(0,2),(0,1),(1,0),(2,0)

(1,0)=2 occupied, (2,0)=9 occupied, (0,1)=3 occupied. So should go to (2,1) or (1,2) or (0,2).

Probably to (2,1), then (3,1), etc.

In the diagram, after 10 is not shown, but likely.

The spiral direction: from center, after completing a ring, it moves to the next.

Ring 0: just 1.

Ring 1: cells adjacent to center. There are 6 cells: numbers 2 to 7.

In my assignment: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (-1,-1):6? Earlier I have (-1,-1):6, but what about (0,-1)? I have (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8.

But numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7 should be ring 1, but I have up to 8? 1 is center, then ring 1 should be 2 to 7, but I assigned (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, then (-1,-1):6, (0,-1):7, and (1,-1):8? But (1,-1) is also adjacent to center? Distance from center.

In hex grid, distance is max of |dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr| or something. In axial coordinates, the distance between (0,0) and (q,r) is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 where s= -q-r, but since s= -q-r, |q| + |r| + |q+r|, but actually for distance d, it's max(|q|,|r|,|s|).

Standard hex distance: dist = ( |dq| + |dr| + |ds| ) / 2 where ds = -dq-dr, but since ds is determined, dist = max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| )? Let's calculate.

For (1,0): q=1,r=0,s=-1, |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1, max is 1, dist=1.

(0,1): q=0,r=1,s=-1, max| | =1.

(-1,1): q=-1,r=1,s=0, max1.

(-1,0): q=-1,r=0,s=1, max1.

(0,-1): q=0,r=-1,s=1, max1.

(1,-1): q=1,r=-1,s=0, max1.

All these are at distance 1, so ring 1 consists of these 6 cells.

But in the numbering, center 1, then the six neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in my earlier assignment, I have (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, and (1,-1):8? But 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not a neighbor of center? (-1,-1): q=-1,r=-1,s=2, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, max is 2, so distance 2, not 1. Mistake.

In the diagram, at r=-1, q=-1:6, but distance to (0,0): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=| -(-1)-(-1)|=|1+1|=2, max(1,1,2)=2, so it's in ring 2.

Similarly, (0,-1):7, q=0,r=-1,s=1, max(0,1,1)=1, so should be ring 1, but I have it as 7.

Let's list the cells at distance 1:

- (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)? (1,-1): q=1,r=-1,s=0, max(1,1,0)=1, yes.

But in the diagram, what is at (1,-1)? In row r=-1, q=1:8.

At (0,-1):q=0,r=-1:7.

At (-1,0):q=-1,r=0:5.

At (-1,1):q=-1,r=1:4.

At (0,1):q=0,r=1:3.

At (1,0):q=1,r=0:2.

So the six neighbors are: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8? But that's 2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing 6.

6 is at (-1,-1), which is not a neighbor; it's at distance 2.

The center is 1.

The first ring should be the six adjacent cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in the diagram, we have 2,3,4,5, and then 6,7,8 in lower row, but 6 at (-1,-1), which is not adjacent.

Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.

For (0,0), neighbors should include (0,-1), but in my list, (0,-1) is 7, but it should be one of the first six.

Let's look at the sequence. The numbers are filled in order: 1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7 for the first ring, then 8,9,10, etc for next ring.

From the diagram, after 1 is 2, then 3, then 4, then 5, then 6, then 7, then 8.

From the positions:

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0)  // east

3 at (0,1)  // northeast? but earlier I thought NW from 2.

From 2 at (1,0) to 3 at (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, which is northwest.

Then from 3 at (0,1) to 4 at (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=0, west.

Then from 4 at (-1,1) to 5 at (-1,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south.

Then from 5 at (-1,0) to 6 at (-1,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, south again? But to (-1,-1), which is southwest.

Then from 6 at (-1,-1) to 7 at (0,-1): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Then from 7 at (0,-1) to 8 at (1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Then from 8 at (1,-1) to 9 at (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, northeast.

Then from 9 at (2,0) to 10 at (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest.

Then from 10 at (1,1) to 11 at (1,2)? or (0,2)? etc.

But the first ring should be the six cells at distance 1, which are (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), but in this numbering, (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8, so 6 is missing, and 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not in this list.

(-1,-1) is at distance max(|-1|,|-1|,| -1-1|)=max(1,1,2)=2, so it's in ring 2.

But in the sequence, 6 is after 5, before 7, so it should be in ring 1.

Contradiction.

Unless the center is not at (0,0), or the coordinate system is different.

Perhaps the grid is pointy-top instead of flat-top.

Let me try that.

Assume pointy-top hexagons. Then neighbors are E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.

Center at (0,0).

Neighbors: say (1,0): E, (1,1): NE, (0,1): NW, (-1,0): W, (-1,-1): SW, (0,-1): SE.

From diagram, east of 1 is 2, so (1,0) =2.

West of 1 is 5, so (-1,0) =5.

Now above: in row -1, we have 14,4,3,10. Directly above might be at (0,1) or (1,1).

Suppose (0,1) is above, at 3? Then (1,1) is NE, at 10? But 10 is larger.

From 2 at (1,0), to 3. If 3 is at (0,1), then from (1,0) to (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, which in pointy-top might be NW or something.

Let's calculate distance.

For pointy-top, axial coordinates same, distance is still max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|).

Same as before.

The cell at (-1,-1) is still distance 2.

But 6 is there, and it should be close.

Perhaps the center is 1, and the first cell is 2 at (1,0), then 3 at (1,1), then 4 at (0,1), then 5 at (-1,0), then 6 at (-1,-1), then 7 at (0,-1), then 8 at (1,-1), etc.

Let's try that.

So 1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0) // E

3 at (1,1) // NE

4 at (0,1) // NW

5 at (-1,0) // W

6 at (-1,-1) // SW

7 at (0,-1) // SE

8 at (1,-1) // but (1,-1) is SE of (1,0), but in sequence after 7 is 8, and (1,-1) is not adjacent to 7 at (0,-1)? Neighbors of (0,-1) are (1,-1), (1,0), (0,0), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2)? (1,-1) is a neighbor, yes, dq=1, dr=0? From (0,-1) to (1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, which is east.

Then from 8 at (1,-1) to 9 at (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, NE.

Then to 10 at (2,1) or something.

In the diagram, at r=1, q=1:10, so (1,1):10, but in this assignment, (1,1):3, which is already occupied.

So not.

Perhaps from 7 at (0,-1) to 8 at (0,-2) or something, but not in diagram.

Another idea: perhaps the spiral is filled in a different order. From the diagram, after 1 is 2, then above 2 is 3? But in the text, above 1 is 3, but 2 is to the right, so above 2 might be different.

Let's list the cells from the diagram with their numbers.

From row r=0 (middle row): cells at q= -2:15, q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9

Row r=1 (top row): q= -2:14, q=-1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10

Row r= -1 (bottom row): q= -2:16, q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8

Now, the sequence of filling: 1, then 2 (east), then 3 (north), then 4 (west-north), then 5 (west), then 6 (south-west), then 7 (south), then 8 (east-south), then 9 (east of 2), then 10 (north of 3), etc.

After 8 at (1,-1), next is 9 at (2,0), which is northeast of (1,-1), then 10 at (1,1), northwest of (2,0)? From (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, NW.

Then next should be 11 at (0,1)? but (0,1) is already 3, occupied. So probably to (0,2) or (1,2) or (2,1).

Likely to (2,1), then (3,1), etc.

But for the first ring, we have cells: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8, and (-1,-1):6.

So the six neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 6 is at (-1,-1), which is also a neighbor of 5 and 7, but not of 1.

So for cell 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 6 is not a neighbor; it's diagonal or something.

Distance from 1 to 6: as calculated, max| q|,|r|,|q+r| = max| -1|,|-1|,| -1-1| = max(1,1,2) =2, while neighbors are at distance 1.

But in the numbering, 6 is between 5 and 7, so it must be adjacent to them, but not to 1.

So the first ring has 6 cells: 2 to 7, but 6 is at a distance 2 cell, while 7 and 8 are at distance 1 cells.

Let's list the numbers at distance 1 cells:

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):3

- (-1,1):4

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):7

- (1,-1):8

So numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8. But 6 is missing, and 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not distance 1.

But 6 should be in the first ring, but it's not. Unless the first ring is not distance 1.

Perhaps "ring" is defined by the turn, not by distance.

For example, ring 0: cell 1.

Then ring 1: cells added when first turn, which are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in the grid, 6 is at a different location.

Let's list the cells in order of filling:

Cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: (1,0)  // E

Cell 3: (0,1)  // NW from 2? or N

From 2 at (1,0) to 3 at (0,1): vector (-1,1)

Cell 4: (-1,1) // W from 3: vector (-1,0)

Cell 5: (-1,0) // S from 4: vector (0,-1)

Cell 6: (-1,-1) // S from 5: vector (0,-1) again? but to (-1,-1), which is SW, vector (0,-1)? dq=0, dr= -1, same as before, but in hex grid, moving south from (-1,0) should go to (-1,-1)? In axial coordinates, moving "south" might be (0,-1), but from (-1,0) to (0,-1) would be SE, not S.

I think I have a mistake in the coordinate system.

In axial coordinates, the direction "south" might not be pure dr change.

Let's define the directions properly.

In axial coordinates, the six directions can be defined by vectors:

Let me set:

- E: (1,0)

- SE: (0,-1)  // for pointy-top, but earlier I had flat-top.

Perhaps for this grid, it's better to use offset or other system.

Notice that in the bottom row, we have cells at r= -1: 16,6,7,8 at q= -2,-1,0,1

Top row r=1: 14,4,3,10 at q= -2,-1,0,1

Middle r=0: 15,5,1,2,9 at q= -2,-1,0,1,2

So for each r, q ranges, and the grid is rectangular in this view, with r from -1 to 1, q from -2 to 2, but not all cells are filled; for example at r=1, q=2 is not shown, probably not filled yet.

The cells are filled in a spiral path that winds around.

From the sequence, after 1 (0,0), go to 2 (1,0)

 then to 3 (0,1)  // so from (1,0) to (0,1): left and up

 then to 4 (-1,1) // left

 then to 5 (-1,0) // down

 then to 6 (-1,-1) // down-left? but in coordinates, from (-1,0) to (-1,-1): down, since r decreases.

 then to 7 (0,-1) // right

 then to 8 (1,-1) // right

 then to 9 (2,0) // up-right

 then to 10 (1,1) // up-left

 then to 11 (0,2) or (2,1) etc.

In the diagram, at (1,1) is 10, so after 9 at (2,0), to 10 at (1,1)

 then next should be 11. Neighbors of 10: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0)

(1,0)=2, (2,0)=9, (0,1)=3, all occupied, so go to (2,1) or (1,2) or (0,2).

Probably to (2,1), then (3,1), etc.

For the first "ring", cells 2 to 7 are not all at distance 1; cell 6 at (-1,-1) is distance 2, while cell 7 at (0,-1) is distance 1, cell 8 at (1,-1) is distance 1.

But cell 6 is filled before 7, and it's at distance 2.

So the rings are not based on distance; rather, the spiral has arms or something.

Perhaps the spiral is filled in layers, but each layer has more cells.

Let me find out how many cells are in each "ring".

Ring 0: 1 cell: 1

Ring 1: 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the grid, 2,3,4,5,6,7 are filled, but 6 is at distance 2, 7 at distance 1, so not uniform distance.

Cell 1: dist 0

Cell 2: dist 1

Cell 3: dist 1

Cell 4: dist 1

Cell 5: dist 1

Cell 6: dist 2

Cell 7: dist 1

Cell 8: dist 1

Cell 9: dist 2

Cell 10: dist 2

Cell 11: dist 2 or 3, etc.

So distances are not constant per ring.

Perhaps the ring is defined by the step when it is added.

For example, the k-th ring has 6k cells for k>=1, but ring 0 has 1, ring 1 has 6, ring 2 has 12, etc, total up to ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1) or something.

Let's calculate the cumulative cells.

The total number of cells up to ring k should be 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6* k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1 cell

k=1: 1+3*1*2=1+6=7 cells: 1 to 7

k=2: 1+3*2*3=1+18=19 cells: 1 to 19

But in the diagram, we have up to 16, and 9,10, etc, so for example cell 16 is at q=-2,r=-1, which is probably in ring 2.

Cell 1: ring 0

Cells 2-7: ring 1

Cells 8-19: ring 2

In the grid, cell 8 at (1,-1), cell 9 at (2,0), cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (2,1) or something, cell 12, etc, up to cell 19.

Then ring 3 has 18 cells, and so on.

Now, for a cell in ring k, its neighbors may be in ring k-1, k, or k+1.

But for the number 2026, I need to find which ring it is in, and its position, then find its neighbors.

First, find the ring number k for n=2026.

The largest m such that the total cells up to ring m is at least 2026.

Total cells up to ring m is S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

Set 1 + 3m(m+1) >= 2026

3m^2 + 3m +1 >= 2026

3m^2 +3m -2025 >=0

m^2 +m -675 >=0

Solve m^2 +m -675=0

m = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1±sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let's see 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.96

So m = [-1 +51.96]/2 ≈ 50.96/2 ≈ 25.48

So m=25, S(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1+1950=1951

S(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1+2106=2107

Since 1951 < 2026 < 2107, so n=2026 is in ring 26.

Ring k has 6k cells, so ring 26 has 6*26=156 cells.

The first cell of ring k is at S(k-1) +1

S(k-1) = 1 + 3(k-1)k

For k=26, S(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1+1950=1951, as above.

So first cell of ring 26 is 1952.

Last cell is S(26) -1 = 2107 -1 = 2106? S(26)=2107, which is up to ring 26, so last cell is 2107, but since ring 26 has 156 cells, from 1952 to 1952+156-1=2107, yes, 1952 to 2107 inclusive is 2107-1952+1=156 cells.

Now n=2026 is in this ring.

I need to find the position of cell n in the ring.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k cells, but for ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells? For k=1, ring 1 has 6 cells, so each "side" has 1 cell? Typically in hexagonal spirals, ring k has 6k cells, and it can be divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

For example, ring 1: 6 cells, each side has 1 cell.

Ring 2: 12 cells, each side has 2 cells.

Yes.

The spiral starts at a certain direction and goes around.

From the initial part, for ring 1: cells 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In our grid, at positions:

2: (1,0)

3: (0,1)

4: (-1,1)

5: (-1,0)

6: (-1,-1)

7: (0,-1)? But earlier we have 7 at (0,-1), but what about (1,-1)? In our earlier assignment, (1,-1) is 8, which is in ring 2.

For ring 1, cells should be the six at distance 1, but in our grid, we have only five at distance 1: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, and missing one. (1,-1) is 8, not in ring 1.

But cell 6 is at (-1,-1), which is distance 2.

So the cells in ring 1 are not all at distance 1; cell 6 is at distance 2.

Let's list the positions for cells 2 to 7:

From filling order:

2: (1,0)

3: (0,1)

4: (-1,1)

5: (-1,0)

6: (-1,-1)

7: (0,-1)

So positions: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1)

Now, distance from center (0,0):

(1,0): dist max(1,0,1)=1? |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=| -1-0|=1, max(1,0,1)=1

(0,1): max(0,1,|0+1|=1)=1

(-1,1): max(1,1,| -1+1|=0)=1

(-1,0): max(1,0,1)=1

(-1,-1): max(1,1,| -1-1|=2)=2

(0,-1): max(0,1,1)=1

So cell 6 at (-1,-1) is at distance 2, while others at distance 1.

So the ring includes cells at different distances; it's not a geometric ring, but a "spiral arm" or something.

For the purpose of the spiral, the ring is defined by the turn, and cells are added in order along the perimeter.

For ring k, it has 6k cells, and it starts at a certain point.

From the filling, for ring 1 (k=1), it starts at (1,0) with cell 2, then goes to (0,1) for cell 3, then to (-1,1) for cell 4, then to (-1,0) for cell 5, then to (-1,-1) for cell 6, then to (0,-1) for cell 7.

The directions: from start, it goes in the direction of the previous move or something.

From cell 1, it moves east to cell 2.

Then from 2, it moves northwest to cell 3 (dq=-1,dr=1)

Then from 3, west to cell 4 (dq=-1,dr=0)

Then from 4, south to cell 5 (dq=0,dr=-1)

Then from 5, south to cell 6 (dq=0,dr=-1) again? But to (-1,-1), which is south from (-1,0)? In axial, from (-1,0) to (-1,-1) is dq=0, dr=-1, same as south.

Then from 6, east to cell 7 (dq=1,dr=0)

Then for ring 2, it starts from cell 7 at (0,-1), but typically, after completing a ring, it moves to the next cell in the same direction or turns.

From cell 7 at (0,-1), it moves east to cell 8 at (1,-1) (dq=1,dr=0)

Then from 8, northeast to cell 9 at (2,0) (dq=1,dr=1)

Then from 9, northwest to cell 10 at (1,1) (dq=-1,dr=1)

Then from 10, west to cell 11? But (0,1) is occupied by 3, so probably to (0,2) or (1,2), let's assume to (0,2) for cell 11.

Then from 11, west to cell 12 at (-1,2)? Then south to cell 13 at (-1,1), but (-1,1) is occupied by 4, so south to (-1,0), occupied, so probably not.

From 10 at (1,1), after northwest from 9, then it should continue in the same direction or turn.

In many spirals, after turning at corners, it goes straight.

For ring 2, since it has 12 cells, 2 per side.

The sides are in different directions.

Typically, the ring starts at the cell adjacent to the start of previous ring in a certain direction.

In this case, the start of ring 1 is at (1,0), which is east of center.

End of ring 1 is at (0,-1), which is southeast.

Then it moves to the next cell, which is east from there, to (1,-1) for cell 8.

Then for the new ring, it goes in the "forward" direction, which for the first side, it might be the same as the last move or something.

From cell 8 at (1,-1), it moves northeast to (2,0) for cell 9.

Then from 9, it should continue in a similar manner as ring 1.

In ring 1, from start (1,0), it went NW to (0,1), then W to (-1,1), then S to (-1,0), then S to (-1,-1), then E to (0,-1).

So for ring 2, from start at (1,-1)? But cell 8 is at (1,-1), cell 9 at (2,0), which is NE from (1,-1).

Then from 9 at (2,0), it should go NW to (1,1) for cell 10, which it did.

Then from 10 at (1,1), in ring 1, from (0,1) it went W to (-1,1), so here from (1,1) it should go W to (0,1), but (0,1) is occupied by 3, so it can't, so it must go to the next available, which is probably W to (0,1) is occupied, so it turns or goes to (0,2) or (1,2).

In the diagram, after 10 is not shown, but likely it goes to (0,2) for cell 11, then to (-1,2) for cell 12, then to (-1,1) but occupied, so down to (-1,0) occupied, so perhaps to (-2,1) or something.

For cell 11, if at (0,2), cell 12 at (-1,2), cell 13 at (-2,2)? or down.

Typically, it goes west to (-1,2), then south to (-1,1), but (-1,1) is occupied, so it must turn south immediately.

From (-1,2) to (-1,1), but occupied, so perhaps to (-1,0)? but not adjacent.

From (-1,2), neighbors are (0,2), (-1,3), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-1,1), (0,1)

(-1,1) occupied, (0,1) occupied, so go to (-2,2) or (-2,1) or (-1,3).

Probably to (-2,2) for cell 12, then to (-2,1) for cell 13, then to (-2,0) for cell 14, etc.

In the diagram, at r=1, q= -2:14, so cell 14 at (-2,1)? r=1, q= -2.

Cell 13 at (-2,1)? but in diagram q=-2,r=1:14, so cell 14 at (-2,1).

Cell 12 at (-2,2)? or (-1,2).

Assume cell 11 at (0,2), cell 12 at (-1,2), cell 13 at (-2,2)? but not in diagram.

From the diagram, at r=1, we have q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10, so for r=1, cells at q= -2,-1,0,1.

Cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (0,2)? but r=2, not shown.

Cell 12 at (-1,2)? r=2.

But in the diagram for r=1, we have cell 14 at q= -2,r=1, which is probably cell 14.

So likely, after cell 10 at (1,1), it goes to cell 11 at (1,2) or (0,2).

Suppose it goes to (1,2) for cell 11.

Then from (1,2), go west to (0,2) for cell 12.

Then to (-1,2) for cell 13.

Then to (-1,1) but occupied, so turn south to (-1,0)? but not adjacent; from (-1,2) to (-1,1) is south, but (-1,1) is occupied by 4, so it must go to a different direction.

Perhaps after cell 12 at (0,2), it goes south to (0,1), but occupied, so perhaps directly to (-1,1) but occupied, so it turns to south-west or something.

To avoid occupation, it might go to (-1,2) for cell 13, then since can't go south, go west to (-2,2) for cell 14, then south to (-2,1) for cell 15, then south to (-2,0) for cell 16, etc.

In the diagram, at r=1, q= -2:14, r=0, q= -2:15, r= -1, q= -2:16, so cell 14 at (-2,1), cell 15 at (-2,0), cell 16 at (-2,-1).

So likely, cell 11 at (1,2), cell 12 at (0,2), cell 13 at (-1,2), cell 14 at (-2,1)? from (-1,2) to (-2,1): dq= -1, dr= -1, which is SW or something.

Then cell 15 at (-2,0), from (-2,1) to (-2,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south.

Cell 16 at (-2,-1), south again.

Cell 17 at (-1,-1), but (-1,-1) is occupied by 6, so probably to (-1,0) or something.

From (-2,-1) to (-1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Cell 17 at (-1,-1)? but occupied, so conflict.

Cell 6 is at (-1,-1), ring 1, so occupied.

So from cell 16 at (-2,-1), neighbors are (-3,-1), (-2,0), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (-2,-2), (-3,-2), etc.

(-1,-1) occupied, (-2,0) is cell 15, occupied, so go to (-3,-1) or (-2,-2) or etc.

But in the diagram, at r= -1, q= -2:16, so cell 16 at (-2,-1), then next cell 17 at ( -1, -1)? but occupied, or ( -3, -1) or ( -2, -2).

Probably it goes to ( -1, -1) is occupied, so it turns to east or something.

Perhaps after cell 16, it goes to cell 17 at ( -1, -1), but since it's occupied, this can't be; the spiral must avoid occupied cells, so it should not try to go to occupied cells.

For cell 16 at ( -2, -1), next should be to a neighbor that is empty.

Empty neighbors: say ( -3, -1), ( -3, -2), ( -2, -2), etc.

But in the diagram, after 16 is not shown, but at r= -1, we have q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8, so cell 6,7,8 are already filled, so for cell 17, it must be at new location, like ( -3, -1) or ( -2, -2).

But later cells are larger, so ok.

For the purpose of finding neighbors, I need a general way to find the coordinates of a given number.

Perhaps I can see that the grid can be mapped to a coordinate system where the ring and position determine the cell.

For a number n, find ring k such that S(k-1) < n <= S(k), with S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

As before, for n=2026, k=26, S(25)=1951, S(26)=2107, so in ring 26, position in ring p = n - S(k-1) = 2026 - 1951 = 75

So p=75 in ring 26, which has 6*26=156 cells.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k=26 cells.

The sides are in order: usually, the first side is in the "east" direction or something, but in this case, from the start.

The start of the ring is at a certain position.

For ring k, the start cell is at a standard location.

From the initial, for ring 1, start at (1,0)

For ring 2, start at (1,-1)? cell 8 at (1,-1)

Cell 8 is the first cell of ring 2, at (1,-1)

For ring 3, first cell is cell S(2)+1 = 19+1=20? S(2)=1+3*2*3=1+18=19, so cell 20 at start of ring 3.

Where is cell 20? Not shown, but likely at (2,-1) or something.

Generally, the start of ring k is at (k,0) or something.

For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,-1)? not (2,0)

(1,-1) for k=2.

k=3: perhaps (2,-1) or (1,-2)

Assume that the start of ring k is at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

1-1=0, yes.

k=2: (2,1-2)=(2,-1)

But in our case, for k=2, start is cell 8 at (1,-1), not (2,-1).

Cell 8 is at (1,-1), not (2,-1).

Perhaps (k, -k+1) or something.

k=1: (1,0) = (1, -1+1)? -1+1=0, ok.

k=2: (1,-1) = (2, -2+1)=(2,-1)? not the same.

(1,-1) for k=2, while (2,-1) is different.

Perhaps the q-coordinate is k, but r-coordinate is 1-k or something.

k=1: q=1, r=0

k=2: q=1, r= -1

k=3: q=2, r= -1? or q=1, r= -2

Cell 20 for k=3.

From earlier, after cell 19, which is the last of ring 2, at say (0,-2) or something.

In ring 2, cells 8 to 19.

Cell 8: (1,-1)

Cell 9: (2,0)

Cell 10: (1,1)

Cell 11: (1,2) or (0,2) , let's assume cell 11 at (1,2)

Cell 12: (0,2)

Cell 13: (-1,2)

Cell 14: (-2,1)  // from earlier assumption

Cell 15: (-2,0)

Cell 16: (-2,-1)

Cell 17: (-1,-1) but occupied, so probably cell 17 at (-3,-1) or (-2,-2) or ( -1, -2)

Suppose cell 17 at (-1,-2)  // south of (-1,-1)? but (-1,-1) is occupied, so perhaps (-1,-2)

Then cell 18 at (0,-2)

Cell 19 at (1,-2) or (0,-1) occupied.

Cell 19 at (1,-2)

Then cell 20 at (2,-1) or (1,-2) is cell 19, so cell 20 at (2,-1) or (2,-2)

For start of ring 3, likely at (2,-1) or (1,-2), but cell 19 is at (1,-2), so cell 20 at (2,-2) or (2,-1)

Assume cell 20 at (2,-1)

Then it can go to (3,0) etc.

So for k=1: start at (1,0)

k=2: start at (1,-1)

k=3: start at (2,-1) or (2,-2)

Not consistent.

Notice that for k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,-1)

k=3: say (2,-1)

k=4: (2,-2) or (3,-2)

Perhaps q = k, r = 1-k for k>=1? k=1: q=1,r=0

k=2: q=2,r= -1? but we have (1,-1), not (2,-1)

Or q = ceil(k/2) or something.

Another idea: the start cell for ring k is at (k, 0) for k odd, (0, -k) for k even, but not.

Let's list the start cells:

Ring k | first cell | position
1 | 2 | (1,0)
2 | 8 | (1,-1)
3 | 20 | ? let's say (2,-1) or (1,-2)
4 | 38 | S(3)=1+3*3*4=1+36=37, so cell 38 at start of ring 4.

Assume for k=3, cell 20 at (2,-1)

Then cell 21 at (3,0)  // NE
 cell 22 at (2,1)  // NW
 cell 23 at (1,2)  // W, but if cell 11 is at (1,2), and if it's filled, but in ring 2, cell 11 is at (1,2), so for ring 3, cell 23 at (1,2) would be conflict if not careful, but cell 11 is earlier, so ok as long as not the same cell.

In ring 2, cell 11 at (1,2), so for ring 3, cell 23 at (1,2) would be the same cell, conflict.

So must be different.

Perhaps cell 20 at (2,-2) or (1,-2)

Suppose cell 19 at (1,-2) for end of ring 2.

Then cell 20 at (2,-2) for start of ring 3.

Then cell 21 at (3,-1)  // NE from (2,-2)? dq=1, dr=1, NE
 cell 22 at (3,0)  // N or something
 cell 23 at (2,1)  // NW
 cell 24 at (1,2)  // W, but cell 11 may be there, but if cell 11 is in ring 2 at (1,2), then conflict.

Unless the rings are in different layers, but in this case, cell (1,2) is in ring 2 for cell 11, so for ring 3, it can't be used again.

So the start must be at a cell not in previous rings, so for ring k, start at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

k=2: (2,-1) = (2,1-2)

k=3: (3,-2)

k=4: (4,-3) etc.

Then for k=2, we have cell 8 at (1,-1), not (2,-1).

So not matching.

Perhaps the r-coordinate is - (k-1) or something.

For k=1: r=0 = - (1-1) =0, q=1

k=2: r= -1 = - (2-1) = -1, but q=1, not 2.

So q is not k.

Notice that in both k=1 and k=2, q=1, r=0 for k=1, r= -1 for k=2.

For k=3, if q=1, r= -2, then cell 20 at (1,-2)

Then cell 21 at (2,-1)  // E or NE
 cell 22 at (2,0)  // N, but cell 9 at (2,0), occupied.
 cell 23 at (1,1)  // W, cell 10 at (1,1), occupied.

So conflict.

So must be that for k>1, q increases.

Perhaps the start is always at the "southeast" corner or something.

Another idea: the start of ring k is at (k, 0) for all k, but then for k=2, (2,0), but in our case cell 9 at (2,0), which is not the start; start is cell 8 at (1,-1).

So not.

Perhaps in terms of the direction.

From the filling path, the first cell of the ring is always in the "east" direction from the end of the previous ring, but shifted.

After cell 7 at (0,-1), it moves east to cell 8 at (1,-1)

After cell 19, at say (0,-2), move east to cell 20 at (1,-2)

Then from there, it goes northeast to (2,-1), etc.

So generally, for ring k, start at (1, 1-k) ? for k=1: (1,0) yes

k=2: (1,-1) yes

k=3: (1,-2)

k=4: (1,-3) etc.

So start at (1, 1-k)

Then from there, it goes in six directions for the six sides.

For each side, it adds k cells in a certain direction.

For ring k, start at (1,1-k)

Then first side: move in the "northeast" direction, add k cells.

From (1,1-k), move NE to (2,1-k)? NE vector: in axial, what is NE? earlier, from (1,-1) for k=2, it went to (2,0) for cell 9.

From (1,-1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=1, so vector (1,1)

So direction (1,1)

Add k cells in this direction, but only one cell per step, so for the first side, it moves in direction (1,1) for k steps? But for k=2, from (1,-1) to (2,0) is one step, but it should add k=2 cells for the side.

For the side, it adds k cells, but the first cell is already the start, so it needs to add k-1 more cells in that direction, or the side includes the start and k-1 more.

For ring k, each side has k cells, including the corner cells.

For side 1: from start, move in direction D1 for k-1 steps, but since each step adds a cell, it adds k-1 cells, so total cells for the side is k (including start).

For example, ring 1: k=1, each side has 1 cell, so no move, just the cell.

For ring 2: k=2, each side has 2 cells.

Start at (1,-1) for cell 8.

First side: in direction (1,1), so from (1,-1) , move to (1+1,-1+1)=(2,0) for cell 9.

So cells: cell 8 and cell 9.

Then next side: from there, in the next direction.

After cell 9 at (2,0), it went to cell 10 at (1,1), which is vector (-1,1), so direction (-1,1)

Move to (2-1,0+1)=(1,1) for cell 10.

So cells for second side: cell 9 and cell 10.

Then from cell 10 at (1,1), next direction. In ring 1, from (0,1) it went west to (-1,1), so direction (-1,0)

So here, from (1,1), move west to (1-1,1)=(0,1) but occupied, so for ring 2, it should go to (0,1), but occupied, so it must be that for higher rings, it doesn't hit occupied cells immediately, or the direction is different.

In this case, it did go to (0,1), but it was occupied, so in our earlier assumption, it went to (1,2) or something, but in the actual spiral, for ring 2, after cell 10 at (1,1), it should go to the next cell in the next direction, which is west, to (0,1), but since (0,1) is occupied, it skips or something, but in reality, for ring 2, cell 11 is at a different location.

Perhaps the directions are absolute, not relative.

The six directions are fixed: say D1: (1,0) E, D2: (0,1) N, D3: (-1,1) NW, D4: (-1,0) W, D5: (0,-1) S, D6: (1,-1) SE, or something.

From the initial move from center: to (1,0) , so D1: (1,0)

Then to (0,1), vector (-1,1), so D2: (-1,1)

Then to (-1,1), vector (-1,0), so D3: (-1,0)

Then to (-1,0), vector (0,-1), D4: (0,-1)

Then to (-1,-1), vector (0,-1), same as D4, but should be different direction.

From (-1,0) to (-1,-1): vector (0,-1), same as previous.

Then to (0,-1), vector (1,0), D5: (1,0)

Then for ring 2, from (0,-1) to (1,-1), vector (1,0), same as D5 or D1.

Then to (2,0), vector (1,1), new direction.

So the directions are not always the same; it depends on the ring.

For each ring, the first direction is the same as the last direction of the previous ring or something.

From end of ring 1 at (0,-1), last move was from ( -1,-1) to (0,-1) with vector (1,0)

Then for ring 2, first move from (0,-1) to (1,-1) with vector (1,0), same direction.

Then from (1,-1) to (2,0) with vector (1,1), which is a turn.

Then from (2,0) to (1,1) with vector (-1,1), turn, and so on.

The turns are at the "corners".

For a given ring k, it starts at a cell, and the first side is in the same direction as the last move of the previous ring, which is usually the "east" direction or something.

In this case, for ring k, it starts at (1,1-k), and the first move is in direction (1,0) for all k? For k=1, from (1,0) it went to (0,1) with (-1,1), not (1,0).

For k=1, it didn't move in (1,0); it was already there, and moved to (0,1).

For the first cell, it is placed, then it moves to the next.

For the side, it moves in a direction for k steps, but the first cell is already placed, so for a side, it adds k cells: the first is the start, then it moves in a direction for k-1 steps, adding k-1 cells, so total k cells for the side.

For ring k, cell 1 of the ring is at start position.

Then for side 1, it moves in direction D1 for k-1 steps, adding cells 2 to k of the side.

Then at the end, it turns to D2, and moves in D2 for k steps? No, for k steps in total for the side, but since it's a new side, it adds k cells, including the corner cell.

When it turns, the corner cell is shared, so for each side, it adds k cells, but the corner cells are shared between sides, so for a ring, the number of cells is 6k, and there are 6 corners, but each corner is shared by two sides, so if each side has k cells, and there are 6 sides, total 6k cells, with corners counted twice, but since each corner is the end of one side and start of next, it is included in both, so for the cell count, it's correct as long as the last cell of a side is the first cell of the next side, which is not the case; in a path, the cell is not shared; each cell is unique.

In the spiral path, the cells are distinct, so for each side, it adds k new cells, and the corners are included in one side only.

For example, in ring 1: 6 cells, each side has 1 cell, so no move, just the cell.

For ring 2: 12 cells, each side has 2 cells.

Start at A, then move to B, then from B move to C, etc.

So for side 1: cells A and B

Side 2: cells B and C

So cell B is shared, but in the count, for side 1:2 cells, side 2:2 cells, but cell B is counted in both, so total would be more than 12 if not careful, but in reality, when we say "side has 2 cells", it means the cells on that side segment, and since the corner is included in both sides, but in the total ring, it's only once, so for the path, when we traverse, we add cells in sequence, so for the ring, we add 6k cells in order, with the corner cells being added only once, at the turn points.

For the path, it is a closed path with 6k vertices, so 6k cells.

The sides are the segments between turns.

For each "side" in the path, it consists of a sequence of cells in a straight line.

For ring k, each straight side segment has exactly k cells in a row, in the same direction.

For example, in ring 1: each "side" has 1 cell, so no straight line; each cell is a corner.

For ring 2: each side has 2 cells in a straight line.

In our case, for ring 2: cell 8 at (1,-1), cell 9 at (2,0) — are they in a straight line? From (1,-1) to (2,0): vector (1,1), so not axial-aligned; in hex grid, this is a straight line if we consider the grid topology, but in terms of axial coordinates, the vector (1,1) is a direction, and moving in that direction is straight.

In hex grid, moving in a constant direction is straight.

So from (1,-1) to (2,0) is one step in direction (1,1), and it's straight.

Then from (2,0) to (1,1): vector (-1,1), direction (-1,1), so another direction.

So for side 1: cells 8 and 9, direction (1,1)

Side 2: cells 9 and 10, direction (-1,1)

Then side 3: cells 10 and 11, but if cell 11 at (0,1), but occupied, so in reality, it must be that from cell 10 at (1,1), it moves in the next direction, which should be (-1,0) or something, to (0,1), but occupied, so for ring 2, it should have a different path.

Perhaps for each ring, the directions are the same as for ring 1, but scaled.

For ring 1: the directions are: from start, but it doesn't move in a side; it's just corners.

For ring 2: the first move is in the same direction as the first move of ring 1 from its start, but ring 1 from start (1,0) it moved to (0,1) with (-1,1), so for ring 2 from start (1,-1) it should move to (1+ (-1), -1+1) = (0,0), but occupied, so not.

Perhaps the relative direction.

I recall that in some hexagonal spirals, the start is at (k,0) for ring k, and it goes in directions.

Perhaps use a different coordinate system.

Let's define the ring and the sector.

For a number n in ring k, with p = n - S(k-1) , 1 ≤ p ≤ 6k

Then the sector s = floor((p-1)/k) 0 to 5

Then the index i = (p-1) mod k 0 to k-1

Then the position can be determined based on s and i.

For example, for ring 1: k=1, p=1 to 6

s = floor((p-1)/1) = p-1, 0 to 5

i = (p-1) mod 1 = 0 for all.

Then for each s, a cell.

s=0: (1,0)

s=1: (0,1)

s=2: (-1,1)

s=3: (-1,0)

s=4: (-1,-1)

s=5: (0,-1)

Which matches cells 2 to 7.

For ring 2: k=2, p=1 to 12

s = floor((p-1)/2) , so for p=1,2: s=0; p=3,4: s=1; p=5,6: s=2; p=7,8: s=3; p=9,10: s=4; p=11,12: s=5

i = (p-1) mod 2, so for each s, i=0 or 1.

Now for each s, what is the cell.

For s=0: i=0: cell 8 at (1,-1)

i=1: cell 9 at (2,0)

For s=1: i=0: cell 10 at (1,1)

i=1: cell 11 at ? say (0,2) or (1,2)

Assume cell 11 at (0,2)

For s=2: i=0: cell 12 at (-1,2)

i=1: cell 13 at (-2,1) or something

s=3: i=0: cell 14 at (-2,0) or (-2,1)

In diagram, cell 14 at (-2,1)

s=4: i=0: cell 15 at (-2,0) if not, or (-2,-1)

Cell 15 at (-2,0)

s=5: i=0: cell 16 at (-2,-1) or (-1,-1) but occupied

Cell 16 at (-2,-1)

i=1: cell 17 at (-1,-2) or something

Then cell 18 at (0,-2)

 cell 19 at (1,-2)

So for s=5, i=0: cell 16 at (-2,-1)

i=1: cell 17 at (-1,-2)

But then cell 18 and 19 for next, but s=5 should have only two cells, p=11,12 for s=5.

p=11: s= floor(10/2)=5, i=10 mod 2=0? (p-1) mod k = (11-1) mod 2 =10 mod 2=0

p=12: (12-1) mod 2=11 mod 2=1

So cell 11: s=5? p=11, s= floor(10/2)=5, i=0

Cell 12: p=12, s=5, i=1

But in our assumption, cell 11 and 12 are for s=5, but earlier we have cell 11 for s=1 i=1, cell 12 for s=2 i=0, etc.

Inconsistency.

For ring 2, p=1: cell 8, p=2: cell 9, p=3: cell 10, p=4: cell 11, p=5: cell 12, p=6: cell 13, p=7: cell 14, p=8: cell 15, p=9: cell 16, p=10: cell 17, p=11: cell 18, p=12: cell 19

From earlier, cell 8: (1,-1), cell 9: (2,0), cell 10: (1,1), cell 11: say (0,2), cell 12: (-1,2), cell 13: (-2,1), cell 14: (-2,0), cell 15: (-2,-1), cell 16: (-1,-2), cell 17: (0,-2), cell 18: (1,-2), cell 19: (2,-1) or something.

Then for s=0: p=1,2: cells 8,9 at (1,-1), (2,0)

s=1: p=3,4: cells 10,11 at (1,1), (0,2)

s=2: p=5,6: cells 12,13 at (-1,2), (-2,1)

s=3: p=7,8: cells 14,15 at (-2,0), (-2,-1) or (-2,0), (-2,-1)

s=4: p=9,10: cells 16,17 at (-1,-2), (0,-2)

s=5: p=11,12: cells 18,19 at (1,-2), (2,-1)

Now, the position can be given by for each s, a base point and then move in a direction.

For s=0: start at (1,1-k) for k=2, (1,-1), then for i=0: at (1,-1), i=1: at (1,-1) + (1,1) = (2,0) since direction (1,1)

For s=1: start at the end of s=0, which is (2,0), then for i=0: at (2,0), i=1: at (2,0) + (-1,1) = (1,1)  // direction (-1,1)

For s=2: start at (1,1), then for i=0: at (1,1), i=1: at (1,1) + (-1,0) = (0,1) but occupied, so not.

For s=2, if cell 12 at (-1,2), so from end of s=1 at (1,1), move to (-1,2), vector (-2,1), not a unit vector.

So not moving one step at a time in a constant direction.

For each s, the direction is different.

From the initial, for ring 1, the directions for each s are:

s=0: cell at (1,0) , no move, or direction (0,0)

s=1: cell at (0,1), vector from previous (-1,1)

s=2: (-1,1), vector (-1,0)

s=3: (-1,0), vector (0,-1)

s=4: (-1,-1), vector (0,-1) same as previous? or (0,-1)

s=5: (0,-1), vector (1,0)

For ring 2, it might be similar but scaled.

For s=0: cells at (1,-1) and (2,0), so from (1,-1) to (2,0): vector (1,1)

s=1: from (2,0) to (1,1): vector (-1,1)

s=2: from (1,1) to (0,2): vector (-1,1) same as s=1? not.

If cell 11 at (0,2), from (1,1) to (0,2): vector (-1,1), same as from s=1.

Then s=3: from (0,2) to (-1,2): vector (-1,0)

s=4: from (-1,2) to (-2,1): vector (-1,-1)

s=5: from (-2,1) to (-2,-1): vector (0,-2) not good.

If cell 13 at (-2,1), from (-1,2) to (-2,1): vector (-1,-1)

Then s=4: from (-2,1) to (-2,0): vector (0,-1)

s=5: from (-2,0) to (-2,-1): vector (0,-1) same, or to (-1,-2): vector (1,-2) not.

To make it consistent, perhaps the direction for each s is fixed for all rings.

From ring 1:
s=0: direction to next: for s=0 to s=1: from (1,0) to (0,1): vector (-1,1)

But for the cell in s, it is at a location, and the move to the next cell in the ring is in a certain direction.

For the cells in the side, they are in a straight line, so for each side, the cells are generated by moving in a constant direction for the side.

For side s, there is a fixed direction D_s.

For example, for s=0: direction (1,1)

s=1: (-1,1)

s=2: (-1,0)

s=3: (0,-1)

s=4: (1,-1) or something.

For ring 1, each "side" has only one cell, so no direction, but for higher rings, it does.

For ring 2, s=0: cells at (1,-1) and (2,0), direction from first to second: (1,1)

s=1: cells at (2,0) and (1,1), direction (-1,1)

s=2: cells at (1,1) and (0,2), direction (-1,1) same as s=1? not good.

Perhaps s=2: cells at (1,1) and (0,1), but occupied.

Assume that for all rings, the directions are the same as for ring 1 from its cells to the next, but scaled.

Perhaps the base point for each s is the same as for ring 1, but scaled by k.

For example, for s=0, in ring 1: (1,0)

 in ring 2: (2,0) but we have (1,-1) for start.

Notice that for ring k, the start cell is at (k, 1-k) for k>=1? for k=1: (1,0) good, k=2: (2,-1) but we have (1,-1), not matching.

 (k, -k+1) for k=1: (1,0), k=2: (2,-1), but we need (1,-1).

So not.

Another idea: in some spirals, the start is at (k,0) for all k, but then for k=2, (2,0), but in our case cell 9 at (2,0), not start.

Perhaps the angular position.

Perhaps use a different approach.

Let me try to find the coordinates for n=2026.

First, in ring k=26, p=2026-1951=75

 ring has 6*26=156 cells, so p=75.

The ring is divided into 6 arcs, each with 26 cells.

The arcs are in order, and each arc has cells in a straight line in a certain direction.

From the initial, for ring 1, the "arcs" are just the cells themselves, but for higher rings, each arc has multiple cells.

For a given arc s (0 to 5), the cells in that arc are at positions that can be parameterized.

For example, for arc s=0: in ring k, cells from i=0 to k-1, at (k, i - k +1) or something.

For k=2, s=0: cells at (1,-1) and (2,0)

So for i=0: (1,-1), i=1: (2,0)

So perhaps (k, i - k) for i=0: (2,0-2)=(2,-2) not (1,-1)

 (k- i, i - k) or.

Let me set for arc s=0: cells at (k, -k + i) for i=0 to k-1? for k=2, i=0: (2, -2+0)=(2,-2) not (1,-1)

 (i+1, i - k) for i=0: (1,0-2)=(1,-2) not (1,-1)

Notice that for both cells, r + q = 0 for the first? (1,-1): 1+ (-1)=0, (2,0):2+0=2 not.

 r - q = -2 for both?  -1 -1 = -2, 0-2= -2 yes!

For s=0: r - q = -k

For k=2, r - q = -2

Cells: (1,-1): -1 -1 = -2, (2,0): 0-2= -2, yes.

For k=1, s=0: cell at (1,0): 0-1= -1 = -k, good.

Now for s=1: in ring 1: cell at (0,1): r- q =1-0=1

 in ring 2: cells at (2,0) and (1,1): for (2,0):0-2= -2, not 1; for (1,1):1-1=0, not 1.

Not.

Perhaps for each s, a different linear combination.

For s=1 in ring 1: (0,1)

 in ring 2: (2,0) and (1,1), but (2,0) is in s=0 for ring 2, s=1 is cells 10 and 11, say (1,1) and (0,2)

So (1,1): r-q=1-1=0

 (0,2):2-0=2

 not constant.

Perhaps the sum r+q or r-q is constant for the arc.

For s=1, ring 1: (0,1): q+ r =0+1=1

 ring 2: (1,1):1+1=2, (0,2):0+2=2, so q+r = k+1? for k=1,1+1=2? not; for k=2,2, good for ring 2, but for ring 1, should be 1, but 0+1=1, while k+1=2, not match.

 q+r = k for s=1? k=1:1, good; k=2:2, and (1,1):1+1=2, (0,2):0+2=2, good.

For s=2: ring 1: (-1,1): -1+1=0

 ring 2: say (-1,2): -1+2=1, not 0 or 2.

If cell 12 at (-1,2), q+r=1, while k=2, not 2.

If cell 12 at (0,1), but occupied.

Assume for s=2, cells at (-1,2) and (-2,1) or something.

For ring 2, s=2: cells 12 and 13 at (-1,2) and (-2,1)

Then (-1,2): -1+2=1, (-2,1): -2+1= -1, not constant.

Perhaps r is constant or q is constant.

For s=2 in ring 1: (-1,1), r=1

 in ring 2: if cells at (-1,2) and (-2,1), r not constant.

Perhaps for each s, the direction is fixed, and the start is determined.

Let's define the six directions:

Let D0: (1,0)  // E
 D1: (0,1)  // N
 D2: (-1,1) // NW
 D3: (-1,0) // W
 D4: (0,-1) // S
 D5: (1,-1) // SE

But in our case, the moves are not always in these.

From the start of the ring, for arc s, it moves in direction D_s for i steps, but with a base.

For ring k, start at P_k = (1,1-k)

Then for arc s=0: cells at P_k + i * V0 for i=0 to k-1, with V0 = (1,1) or something.

For i=0: P_k = (1,1-k)

i=1: (1,1-k) + V0

For k=2, i=0: (1,-1), i=1: (1,-1) + V0 = (2,0), so V0 = (1,1)

Good.

For arc s=1: cells at the end of s=0, which is P_k + (k-1) * V0 = (1,1-k) + (k-1)(1,1) = (1 + k-1, 1-k + k-1) = (k, -1)

For k=2, (2,-1)

Then for s=1, cells at this point + i * V1 for i=0 to k-1

For i=0: (2,-1)

i=1: (2,-1) + V1

In our case, for k=2, cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (0,2) or (1,2)

So from (2,-1) to cell 10 at (1,1), so if i=0: (2,-1), i=1: (2,-1) + V1 = (1,1), so V1 = (-1,2)? not integer or not unit vector.

Perhaps the start of s=1 is not the end of s=0, but the end of s=0 is the first cell of s=1.

For s=1, i=0: end of s=0, i=1: next cell.

For k=2, s=1, i=0: cell 9 at (2,0) , i=1: cell 10 at (1,1), so from (2,0) to (1,1): V1 = (-1,1)

So V1 = (-1,1)

Then for i=0: (2,0), i=1: (2,0) + (-1,1) = (1,1) good.

Then for s=2: start at end of s=1: (1,1)

 cells for i=0: (1,1), i=1: (1,1) + V2

In ring 2, cell 11 and 12, say (0,2) and (-1,2) or (0,2) and (-1,2)

So if cell 11 at (0,2), cell 12 at (-1,2), then from (1,1) to (0,2): V2 = (-1,1) same as V1? not good.

If cell 12 at (-1,1), but occupied.

Assume V2 = (-1,0) for west.

Then i=1: (1,1) + (-1,0) = (0,1), but occupied, so not possible for k>1.

So for higher k, it may not hit, but for k=2, it does hit if we go to (0,1), which is occupied, so in the actual spiral, it must go in a different direction or start from a different point.

Perhaps for s=2, V2 = (-1,1) again, and cell 11 at (0,2), which is (1,1) + (-1,1) = (0,2), then cell 12 at (0,2) + (-1,1) = (-1,3) or something, but not in diagram.

To resolve, perhaps in this spiral, the directions are:
s=0: V= (1,1)
s=1: V= (-1,1)
s=2: V= (-1,0)
s=3: V= (0,-1)
s=4: V= (1,-1)
s=5: V= (1,0)

For ring k, start at P_k = (1,1-k)

Then for s=0: cells at P_k + i * (1,1) for i=0 to k-1

For s=1: cells at Q0 + i * (-1,1) for i=0 to k-1, where Q0 = P_k + (k-1)*(1,1) = (1,1-k) + (k-1, k-1) = (k, k-1)

For s=2: cells at Q1 + i * (-1,0) for i=0 to k-1, where Q1 = Q0 + (k-1)*(-1,1) = (k, k-1) + (-(k-1), k-1) = (1, 2k-2)

For s=3: cells at Q2 + i * (0,-1) for i=0 to k-1, where Q2 = Q1 + (k-1)*(-1,0) = (1,2k-2) + (-(k-1), 0) = (2- k, 2k-2)

For s=4: cells at Q3 + i * (1,-1) for i=0 to k-1, where Q3 = Q2 + (k-1)*(0,-1) = (2-k,2k-2) + (0, - (k-1)) = (2-k, k-1)

For s=5: cells at Q4 + i * (1,0) for i=0 to k-1, where Q4 = Q3 + (k-1)*(1,-1) = (2-k, k-1) + (k-1, - (k-1)) = (1, 0)

Then back to start, but for the next ring, start at (1,1-(k+1)) = (1,-k), while here Q4 + (k-1)*(1,0) = (1,0) + (k-1,0) = (k,0), not (1,-k), so not matching.

For k=2:
P_k = (1,1-2)=(1,-1)
s=0: i=0: (1,-1), i=1: (1,-1) + (1,1) = (2,0)  // cells 8,9
Q0 = (2,0) + (1,1) for i=1? Q0 = P_k + (k-1)*(1,1) = (1,-1) +1*(1,1) = (2,0)
s=1: i=0: (2,0), i=1: (2,0) + (-1,1) = (1,1)  // cells 9,10? cell 9 is already in s=0, so cell 10 at (1,1)
Q1 = Q0 + (k-1)*(-1,1) = (2,0) +1*(-1,1) = (1,1)
s=2: i=0: (1,1), i=1: (1,1) + (-1,0) = (0,1)  // but (0,1) is occupied by cell 3, so conflict.

So for k>1, it may hit occupied cells, but in the actual spiral, it doesn't because the ring is outward, so for k>1, the cells are new, not occupied.

For k=2, (0,1) is already occupied by cell 3, so if we place a cell at (0,1) for cell 11, it would be on top, which is not possible.

So in the spiral, when it tries to go to an occupied cell, it must turn earlier or later, but in this case, for the standard hexagonal spiral, it should not hit occupied cells if done correctly.

Perhaps for this specific spiral, the directions are different.

Perhaps the first move is always in the "north" direction or something.

Let's look online or recall that for hexagonal spiras, the number at (x,y) can be calculated, but perhaps for this problem, since we need only the neighbors of 2026, and 2026 is large, but we can find its position, then find the six adjacent cells, then find their numbers, but that might be hard.

Perhaps the neighbors can be found without finding the exact position, by properties of the spiral.

Another idea: in such spirals, the six neighbors of a number n are usually n±1, n±d, n±e for some d,e, but from the center, for n=1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, which are not consecutive.

2,3,4,5,7,8, so 6 is missing, and 6 is not a neighbor.

So not consecutive.

Perhaps for a cell in ring k, its neighbors are in rings k-1, k, k+1.

For n=2026 in ring 26, its neighbors could be in ring 25, 26, or 27.

Ring 25 has cells from S(24)+1 to S(25)
S(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1+3*600=1+1800=1801
S(25)=1+3*25*26=1+1950=1951
 so cells 1802 to 1951

Ring 26: 1952 to 2107

Ring 27: 2108 to S(27)=1+3*27*28=1+3*756=1+2268=2267, so 2108 to 2267

Now n=2026 is in ring 26, so its neighbors could have numbers in 1802-1951, 1952-2107, or 2108-2267.

The sum of neighbors might be approximately 6*2026, but since it's not symmetric, probably not.

Perhaps for cells not on the corner, the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and four others.

But in the spiral, the cells are filled in order, so the number n is at a cell, and its neighbors may have numbers close to n or not.

For example, for n=1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, which are all close to 1.

For n=6 at (-1,-1), its neighbors: in the grid, adjacent cells.

From earlier, cell 6 at (-1,-1)

Neighbors: (0,-1):7, (-1,0):5, (0,0):1, (-1,-2)? (0,-2)? (-2,-1)? (-2,0)? etc.

In the diagram, at r= -1, q= -1:6, so neighbors: (0,-1):7, (-1,0):5, (0,0):1, ( -1, -1) has neighbors (0,-1), (-1,0), (0,0), ( -1, -2), ( -2, -1), ( -2,0)? Standard axial neighbors: for (q,r) = (-1,-1), neighbors:
 (q+1,r) = (0,-1)
 (q, r+1) = (-1,0)
 (q-1, r+1) = (-2,0)? Let's list:
- (q+1, r) = (0,-1)
- (q, r+1) = (-1,0)
- (q-1, r) = (-2,-1)
- (q, r-1) = (-1,-2)
- (q+1, r-1) = (0,-2)
- (q-1, r+1) = (-2,0)? In axial coordinates, the six neighbors are:
 (q+1, r), (q, r+1), (q-1, r+1), (q-1, r), (q, r-1), (q+1, r-1) ? I think I have a mistake.

Standard axial coordinates for hex grid:
The neighbors of (q,r) are:
- (q+1, r)
- (q, r+1)
- (q-1, r+1) ? No.

Actually, the three directions can be defined, but typically, the six vectors are:
 (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) for one orientation.

For (q,r), neighbors:
 (q+1, r)
 (q, r+1)
 (q-1, r+1) ? Let's calculate the s-coordinate.

In axial coordinates, s = -q -r, but for distance, but for neighbors, the cells at Manhattan distance 1.

The differences in (q,r,s) should have sum of absolute differences 2, but since s= -q- r, the neighbors have one coordinate changed by ±1, others adjust.

Specifically, the six neighbors are obtained by changing two coordinates by -1 and +1, but in practice, for (q,r), the neighbors are:
- (q+1, r) , s= -q-1-r = s-1
- (q-1, r) , s= -q+1-r = s+1
- (q, r+1) , s= -q-r-1 = s-1
- (q, r-1) , s= -q-r+1 = s+1
- (q+1, r-1) , s= -q-1-r+1 = -q-r = s
- (q-1, r+1) , s= -q+1-r-1 = -q-r = s

And the last two have s unchanged, but in terms of (q,r), it's (q+1, r-1) and (q-1, r+1)

So yes, the six neighbors are:
1. (q+1, r)
2. (q, r+1)
3. (q-1, r+1)
4. (q-1, r)
5. (q, r-1)
6. (q+1, r-1)

For cell at ( -1, -1):
1. (0, -1) : cell 7
2. (-1, 0) : cell 5
3. (-2, 0) : cell 15 or later
4. (-2, -1) : cell 16
5. (-1, -2) : not filled yet in diagram, but later cell
6. (0, -2) : later cell

In the diagram, at the time of cell 6, cells 1 to 8 are filled, so for cell 6, its neighbors are:
- (0,-1):7 (filled)
- (-1,0):5 (filled)
- (-2,0): not filled yet
- (-2,-1): not filled
- (-1,-2): not filled
- (0,-2): not filled

So only 5 and 7 are filled at that time, but later other cells are filled, but for the grid, the cells are there, so the neighbors are cells at those positions, regardless of when filled.

So for cell 6 at (-1,-1), neighbors are:
- (0,-1): cell 7
- (-1,0): cell 5
- (-2,0): cell 15 (from diagram, at r=0, q= -2:15)
- (-2,-1): cell 16 (r= -1, q= -2:16)
- (-1,-2): cell ? not in diagram, but later, say cell 17 or 18
- (0,-2): cell 18 or 19

From earlier assumption, cell 17 at (-1,-2), cell 18 at (0,-2), etc.

So neighbors are cells at those positions: 5,7,15,16,17,18

Numbers: 5,7,15,16,17,18

Sum = 5+7+15+16+17+18 = let's calculate: 5+7=12, 15+16=31, 17+18=35, sum 12+31=43, 43+35=78

But for the problem, we need for 2026, but this is for 6.

For n=2026, we need its position.

Perhaps we can find a general formula for the coordinates of n.

Let me define the ring k for n, as before, with S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Then p = n - S(k-1)

Then in the ring, the arc s = floor((p-1)/k)

Then the index i = (p-1) mod k

Then for each s, the cell can be given by a formula.

From the initial for small n.

For example, for n=2, k=1, p=1, s= floor(0/1)=0, i=0, cell at (1,0)

n=3, k=1, p=2, s= floor(1/1)=1, i=0, cell at (0,1)

n=4, p=3, s=2, i=0, cell at (-1,1)

n=5, p=4, s=3, i=0, cell at (-1,0)

n=6, p=5, s=4, i=0, cell at (-1,-1)

n=7, p=6, s=5, i=0, cell at (0,-1)

n=8, k=2, p=1, s= floor(0/2)=0, i=0, cell at (1,-1)

n=9, p=2, s=0, i=1, cell at (2,0)

n=10, p=3, s= floor(2/2)=1, i=0, cell at (1,1)  // assuming

n=11, p=4, s=1, i=1, cell at (0,2) or (1,2) , say (0,2)

 etc.

For s=0: cell at (1+i, 0-i) for i=0 to k-1? for k=2, i=0: (1,0) not (1,-1)

 (1+i, -i) for i=0: (1,0), but for n=8, (1,-1), not match.

 (k, i - k) for i=0: (2, -2) not.

From earlier, for s=0, in both k=1 and k=2, the cell is at (1+i, i - k) for i=0 to k-1

For k=1, i=0: (1,0-1)=(1,-1) but should be (1,0) not match.

 (1+i, -k + i) for i=0: (1, -k), for k=1: (1,-1), not (1,0)

Perhaps (k, 0) for i=0, but not.

Let's list the (q,r) for the cells in order.

For ring k, the start cell is at (k, 0) for k odd, (0, -k) for k even, but not.

Notice that for the start cell of ring k, it is at (1,1-k) as before.

Then the first cell is at (1,1-k)

Then as it moves, for the first arc, it moves in direction (1,1), so cells at (1 + i, 1-k + i) for i=0 to k-1

For i=0: (1,1-k)

i=1: (2,2-k)

i=2: (3,3-k) etc.

For k=1: i=0: (1,0) good for n=2

For k=2: i=0: (1,-1) good for n=8
i=1: (2,0) good for n=9

For the second arc, after i=k-1, at (k, k-k) = (k,0)

Then it turns to next direction, which from earlier is (-1,1), so cells at (k - j, 0 + j) for j=0 to k-1, but j is the index for this arc.

For arc s=1, cells at (k - i, 0 + i) for i=0 to k-1

For i=0: (k,0) which is the last cell of previous arc, so for the cell number, it is the same cell, so we need to start from i=0 for the first cell of the arc.

For s=1, i=0: (k,0)
i=1: (k-1,1)
i=2: (k-2,2) etc.

For k=2: i=0: (2,0) cell 9, i=1: (1,1) cell 10, good.

For k=1: s=1, i=0: (1,0) cell 2, but should be cell 3 at (0,1), not the same.

For k>1, it works, but for k=1, it's different.

Since for n=2026, k=26>1, we can use this.

For s=2: after i=k-1 for s=1, at (k - (k-1), 0 + (k-1)) = (1,k-1)

Then next direction, from earlier, for k=2, from (1,1) , it went to (0,2) or (1,2), but in our case cell 11 at (0,2) or (1,2)

If we assume direction (-1,0) for west, then cells at (1 - i, k-1 + 0*i) = (1-i, k-1) for i=0 to k-1

For i=0: (1,k-1)
i=1: (0,k-1)
i=2: (-1,k-1) etc.

For k=2: i=0: (1,1) cell 10, i=1: (0,1) but occupied by cell 3, so conflict.

If direction (-1,1), then cells at (1 - i, k-1 + i) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (1,k-1)
i=1: (0,k)
i=2: (-1,k+1) etc.

For k=2: i=0: (1,1) cell 10, i=1: (0,2) cell 11, good, and (0,2) is new.

Then for s=3: after i=k-1 for s=2, at (1 - (k-1), k-1 + (k-1)) = (2- k, 2k-2)

Then next direction, from earlier, for k=2, from (0,2), it went to (-1,2) for cell 12, so vector (-1,0), so direction (-1,0)

Cells at (2-k - i, 2k-2 + 0*i) = (2-k-i, 2k-2) for i=0 to k-1

For k=2: i=0: (0,2) cell 11, i=1: (-1,2) cell 12, good.

For s=4: after i=k-1, at (2-k - (k-1), 2k-2) = (3-2k, 2k-2)

Then next direction, for k=2, from (-1,2) to (-2,1) or (-2,2), in diagram cell 14 at (-2,1), so from (-1,2) to (-2,1): vector (-1,-1), so direction (-1,-1)

Cells at (3-2k - i, 2k-2 - i) for i=0 to k-1

For k=2: i=0: (3-4, 4-2) = (-1,2) cell 12, i=1: (-2,1) cell 13 or 14; in our case cell 13 at (-2,1), but in diagram cell 14 at (-2,1), so perhaps cell 13 at something else.

For s=3, we have cells for i=0,1: cell 11,12 at (0,2), (-1,2)

Then s=4: i=0: (3-4,4-2) = (-1,2) which is cell 12, already in s=3, so conflict.

So not good.

Perhaps for s=4, start at the end of s=3, which is (2-k - (k-1), 2k-2) = (3-2k, 2k-2) for k=2: (-1,2) same as s=3 i=1.

So overlap.

To avoid overlap, perhaps the index i starts from 0 for the first cell of the arc, and the cell is new.

For s=3, for k=2, i=0: (0,2) cell 11, i=1: (-1,2) cell 12

Then for s=4, start at (-1,2), but this is already occupied, so for s=4, cells should be at new cells, so from (-1,2), it should go to a new cell, like (-2,1) or (-1,1), but (-1,1) occupied.

In the diagram, after cell 12 at (-1,2), it goes to cell 13 at (-2,1), so vector (-1,-1)

So cells at (-1,2) + i * (-1,-1) for i=0,1

i=0: (-1,2) cell 12, already have, so for i=0: the cell, but it's already added in s=3.

So to have distinct cells, for each arc, the cells are new, so for s=4, it should start with a new cell.

Perhaps the start of s=4 is the cell after the end of s=3.

For s=3, the last cell is at (2-k - (k-1), 2k-2) = (3-2k, 2k-2) for k=2: (-1,2)

Then the next cell for s=4 is at (3-2k -1, 2k-2 -1) = (2-2k, 2k-3) for k=2: (0,1) occupied.

Not good.

Perhaps after s=3, it turns to a different direction.

For s=4, direction (0,-1) or something.

Let's assume for s=3: cells at (2-k - i, 2k-2) for i=0 to k-1, so for i=0: (2-k,2k-2), i=1: (1-k,2k-2), etc.

For k=2: i=0: (0,2) cell 11, i=1: (-1,2) cell 12

Then for s=4: start at end of s=3: (-1,2)

Then cells in direction (0,-1), so ( -1,2 - i) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (-1,2) cell 12, again overlap.

So to fix this, perhaps for each arc, the index i ranges from 0 to k-1, but for the cell, when i=0, it is the cell after the turn, which is new, and the previous cell is the last of previous arc.

In the path, the cells are added in sequence, so for arc s, it adds k cells: the first cell is the corner cell, which is new, and then it adds k-1 cells in the direction.

For example, in ring 2:
s=0: cells 8 and 9: cell 8 at (1,-1), cell 9 at (2,0) — so first cell cell 8, then add cell 9 in direction (1,1)

s=1: first cell cell 9 at (2,0), but cell 9 is already added, so it is shared, so for s=1, it starts with cell 9, then adds cell 10 at (1,1) in direction (-1,1)

s=2: starts with cell 10 at (1,1), adds cell 11 at (0,2) in direction (-1,1) or (-1,0)

 etc.

So in this case, the corner cells are shared between two arcs.

For the numbering, when we have p, it corresponds to the cell in order, so for arc s, it has k cells, but the first cell of the arc is the same as the last cell of the previous arc for s>0.

For s>0, the first cell of s is the last cell of s-1.

In terms of cell index, for arc s, cells from p = s*k +1 to (s+1)*k, but with overlap.

For example, for ring 2, s=0: cells p=1,2: cell 8,9

s=1: cells p=3,4: cell 9,10 — cell 9 is in both.

But p is the index in the ring, so it should be unique, so not.

Perhaps the p includes only distinct cells, so for the ring, p=1 to 6k for the 6k cells.

For arc s, it has k cells, all distinct, and the corner cell is only in one arc.

In the path, when it turns, the corner cell is the last cell of the arc, and the next arc starts with a new cell.

For example in ring 2:
s=0: cells 8,9
s=1: cells 10,11
s=2: cells 12,13
s=3: cells 14,15
s=4: cells 16,17
s=5: cells 18,19

No overlap.

Then for s=0: from (1,-1) to (2,0) for cells 8,9

s=1: from (1,1) to (0,2) for cells 10,11 — but how from cell 9 at (2,0) to cell 10 at (1,1)? not adjacent; in the grid, (2,0) and (1,1) are adjacent, since distance 1, and vector (-1,1), so yes, they are adjacent, so the path is cell 8-9-10-11- etc, so cell 9 to cell 10 is a move, so in the arc s=0 ends at cell 9, s=1 starts at cell 10, so no overlap, and the cells are distinct.

For ring 2: cell 8 at (1,-1), cell 9 at (2,0), cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (0,2), cell 12 at (-1,2), cell 13 at (-2,1), cell 14 at (-2,0), cell 15 at (-2,-1), cell 16 at (-1,-2), cell 17 at (0,-2), cell 18 at (1,-2), cell 19 at (2,-1)

All distinct, and in order.

For s=0: cells 8,9 at (1,-1), (2,0)

s=1: cells 10,11 at (1,1), (0,2)

s=2: cells 12,13 at (-1,2), (-2,1)

s=3: cells 14,15 at (-2,0), (-2,-1)

s=4: cells 16,17 at (-1,-2), (0,-2)

s=5: cells 18,19 at (1,-2), (2,-1)

Now, for each arc s, the cells can be parameterized.

For s=0: cells at (1 + i, -1 + i) for i=0,1: i=0: (1,-1), i=1: (2,0) good.

For s=1: cells at (1 - i, 1 + i) for i=0,1: i=0: (1,1), i=1: (0,2) good.

For s=2: cells at (-1 - i, 2 + 0*i) for i=0,1: i=0: (-1,2), i=1: (-2,2) but we have (-2,1), not (-2,2)

Not match.

Cells at (-1 - i, 2 - i) for i=0,1: i=0: (-1,2), i=1: (-2,1) good.

For s=3: cells at (-2, 0 - i) for i=0,1: i=0: (-2,0), i=1: (-2,-1) good.

For s=4: cells at (-1 + i, -2 - i) or something, i=0: (-1,-2), i=1: (0,-2) good with (-1,-2), (0,-2)

For s=5: cells at (1 + i, -2 + 0*i) or, i=0: (1,-2), i=1: (2,-1) good.

So for each s, with i from 0 to k-1, the cell is:

s=0: (1 + i, -k + i)  // for k=2, (1+i, -2 + i)

s=1: (k - i, i + 1)  // for k=2, (2-i, i+1)

s=2: (-1 - i, k - i)  // (-1-i, 2-i)

s=3: (-k, -i)  // (-2, -i)

s=4: (-k + i, -k - i)  // (-2+i, -2-i)

s=5: (i + 1, -k)  // (i+1, -2)

For k=2, it works as above.

For k=1, let's check:
s=0: (1+0, -1+0)=(1,0) good for n=2
s=1: (1-0, 0+1)=(1,1) but should be (0,1) for n=3, not match.
s=2: (-1-0,1-0)=(-1,1) good for n=4
s=3: (-1,0) good for n=5
s=4: (-1+0,-1-0)=(-1,-1) good for n=6
s=5: (0+1,-1)=(1,-1) but should be (0,-1) for n=7, not match.

So for k=1, s=1 and s=5 are wrong.

Since for n=2026, k=26>1, we can use this formula for k>1.

For k=1, we can handle separately, but not needed.

So for ring k>1, for arc s, with i=0 to k-1, the cell (q,r) is given by:

s=0: q = 1 + i, r = -k + i

s=1: q = k - i, r = i + 1

s=2: q = -1 - i, r = k - i

s=3: q = -k, r = -i

s=4: q = -k + i, r = -k - i

s=5: q = i + 1, r = -k

Now for n=2026, k=26, p=75

s = floor((p-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) = 2? 26*2=52, 74/26=2.846, floor is 2.

p-1=74, k=26, s = floor(74/26) = 2, since 26*2=52 ≤ 74 < 78=26*3, so s=2

Then i = (p-1) mod k = 74 mod 26

26*2=52, 74-52=22, so i=22

Now for s=2: q = -1 - i, r = k - i = 26 - 22 = 4

q = -1 - 22 = -23

So cell at (q,r) = (-23, 4)

Now we need the six neighbors of this cell.

The six neighbors are at:

1. (q+1, r) = (-22, 4)

2. (q, r+1) = (-23, 5)

3. (q-1, r+1) = (-24, 5)

4. (q-1, r) = (-24, 4)

5. (q, r-1) = (-23, 3)

6. (q+1, r-1) = (-22, 3)

Now, each of these cells has a number in the spiral, which we need to find.

To find the number for a given (q,r), we need to find which ring it is in and its position.

Since the spiral is filled in rings, and for each cell, we can find its ring and then its p in the ring.

The ring k for a cell at (q,r) can be found from the distance or from the max norm.

In hex grid, the distance from center is d = max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| )

But as we saw earlier, cells at the same distance may be in different rings, but in this case, for example cell at (-1,-1) is at distance 2, in ring 1, while cell at (2,0) is at distance 2, in ring 2.

So not the same.

However, for cells not on the axes, it might be different, but in general, the ring k is at least the distance d, and for cells on the "boundary", k=d.

But in this case, for our cell (-23,4), distance d = max(|-23|,|4|,|-23+4|)=max(23,4,19)=23

But it is in ring 26, which is larger than 23, so not.

Perhaps k = max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) for some, but here max is 23, k=26.

Perhaps k = |q| + |r| or something, but 23+4=27, not 26.

Notice that in the formulas, for example for s=2, r = k - i, q = -1 - i, and i from 0 to k-1, so r = k - i, so i = k - r, and q = -1 - (k - r) = -1 -k + r

So for cell in s=2, q = r - k -1, r = r, with 1 ≤ r ≤ k

Since i=0 to k-1, r = k - i, so r from k down to 1.

Similarly for other sectors.

For a given (q,r), we can determine which sector it is in and then find k and i.

For example, for (q,r) = (-23,4), from s=2 formula: q = -1 - i, r = k - i

So from r = k - i, q = -1 - i

So i = k - r

Then q = -1 - (k - r) = -1 -k + r

So for this cell, q = r - k -1

With r=4, q= -23, so -23 = 4 - k -1 = 3 - k

So -23 = 3 - k, thus k = 3 + 23 = 26, which matches our k.

Then i = k - r = 26 - 4 = 22, matches.

Now for each neighbor, we can find its (q,r), then find its k and i or directly its number.

Let's do that for each neighbor.

First neighbor: (q+1, r) = (-22, 4)

Now, which sector? We can solve for each possible s.

Since we have (q,r), we can use the distance or assume it's in ring m, and solve.

From the formula, for a cell at (q,r), in ring k, but k may be different.

For this cell (-22,4), distance d = max(|-22|,|4|,|-22+4|)=max(22,4,18)=22

But likely in ring 26 or 25 or 27.

From the sector formulas, we can try to fit to a sector.

For example, if in s=2, then q = r - k -1, r = r, so -22 = 4 - k -1 = 3 - k, so k = 3 +22=25

Then r should be between 1 and k, 4 between 1 and 25, ok.

Then i = k - r = 25 - 4 = 21

Then for ring k=25, S(k-1)=S(24)=1+3*24*25=1+1800=1801

Then p = s*k + i +1? In the ring, for arc s, the cells are from index s*k +1 to (s+1)*k, but since each arc has k cells, and s from 0 to 5, p = s*k + i +1, since i=0 to k-1, p from s*k+1 to (s+1)*k

For s=2, i=21, k=25, p = 2*25 + 21 +1 = 50 +21+1=72? p is the index in the ring, from 1 to 6k=150.

p = s*k + i +1 = 2*25 +21 +1=50+22=72

Then n = S(k-1) + p = 1801 + 72 = 1873

S(k-1)=S(24)=1801, yes.

Now is this correct? We need to verify if for k=25, s=2, i=21, the cell is at (q,r) = ( r - k -1, r) = (4 -25 -1,4)= (-22,4), yes matches.

But is it in ring 25? Ring 25 has cells from S(24)+1=1802 to S(25)=1951, so n=1801 + p, with p=1 to 150, so n=1802 to 1951, so 1873 is within 1802 to 1951, good.

Now for the next neighbor: (q, r+1) = (-23,5)

Similarly, assume in s=2: q = r - k -1, so -23 = 5 - k -1 = 4 - k, so k = 4 +23=27

Then i = k - r = 27 - 5 = 22

Then for ring k=27, S(k-1)=S(26)=2107

p = s*k + i +1 = 2*27 +22 +1=54+22+1=77

n = S(26) + p = 2107 + 77 = 2184

S(k-1)=S(26)=2107, and ring 27 has cells from 2108 to 2267, so n=2107 + p, with p=1 to 6*27=162, so n=2108 to 2268? 2107+162=2269, but S(27)=1+3*27*28=1+3*756=1+2268=2269, so cells 2108 to 2269, so 2107 + p for p=1 to 162, n=2108 to 2269, yes, so n=2107+77=2184

Now neighbor 3: (q-1, r+1) = (-24,5)

Assume s=2: -24 = 5 - k -1 =4 - k, so k=4+24=28

i= k - r =28-5=23

k=28, S(k-1)=S(27)=2269

p = s*k + i +1 =2*28 +23 +1=56+24=80

n=2269 +80=2349

Ring 28 has cells from S(27)+1=2270 to S(28)=1+3*28*29=1+3*812=1+2436=2437, so n=2270 to 2437, 2269+80=2349, which is 2270+79=2349? 2269+80=2349, S(27)=2269, so n=2269 + p, p=1 to 6*28=168, so n=2270 to 2437, so 2269+80=2349, but 2270 +79=2349, so p=80, n=2269+80=2349, which is S(27) + p =2269+80=2349, and since cells start at 2270, this is cell 2270 + (p-1) =2270+79=2349, yes.

Now neighbor 4: (q-1, r) = (-24,4)

Assume s=2: -24 =4 - k -1=3-k, k=3+24=27

i=k-r=27-4=23

k=27, S(k-1)=S(26)=2107

p= s*k + i +1=2*27 +23 +1=54+24=78

n=2107+78=2185

Ring 27: cells 2108 to 2269, n=2107+78=2185, which is 2108+77=2185, yes.

Neighbor 5: (q, r-1) = (-23,3)

s=2: -23=3-k-1=2-k, k=2+23=25

i=k-r=25-3=22

k=25, S(k-1)=S(24)=1801

p=2*25 +22 +1=50+23=73

n=1801+73=1874

Ring 25: 1802 to 1951, n=1801+73=1874, 1802+72=1874, yes.

Neighbor 6: (q+1, r-1) = (-22,3)

s=2: -22=3-k-1=2-k, k=2+22=24

i=k-r=24-3=21

k=24, S(k-1)=S(23)=1+3*23*24=1+3*552=1+1656=1657

p=2*24 +21 +1=48+22=70

n=1657+70=1727

Ring 24: cells 1658 to S(24)=1801, so 1658 to 1801, n=1657+70=1727, 1658+69=1727, yes.

So the six neighbors are at:

1. (-22,4): n=1873

2. (-23,5): n=2184

3. (-24,5): n=2349

4. (-24,4): n=2185

5. (-23,3): n=1874

6. (-22,3): n=1727

Now sum of neighbors: 1873 + 2184 + 2349 + 2185 + 1874 + 1727

Let me calculate step by step.

First, group them.

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

2349 + 1727 = 4076

Now sum these: 3747 + 4369 = 8116

8116 + 4076 = 12192

So sum is 12192.

But let me verify with a small number to ensure the method is correct.

For example, take n=6 at (-1,-1)

Neighbors: as before, (0,-1):7, (-1,0):5, (-2,0):15, (-2,-1):16, (-1,-2):? , (0,-2):?

From earlier, cell at (-1,-2): let's find its number.

(q,r)=(-1,-2)

Assume in some sector.

Distance d=max(1,2,3)=3

Likely in ring 3 or 4.

Assume s=4, for example.

From s=4 formula: q = -k + i, r = -k - i

So -1 = -k + i, -2 = -k - i

Add them: -3 = -2k, so k=1.5, not integer.

s=5: q = i+1, r= -k

r=-2, so -k=-2, k=2

q=i+1

-1=i+1, i=-2, not good.

s=3: q=-k, r=-i

r=-2, so -i=-2, i=2

q=-k

-1=-k, k=1

But ring 1, i=2> k-1=0, not good.

s=2: q= -1 -i, r=k-i

-1=-1-i, so i=0

r=k-0=k

-2=k, k=-2, not good.

s=1: q=k-i, r=i+1

-1=k-i, -2=i+1, so i=-3, not good.

s=0: q=1+i, r=-k+i

-1=1+i, i=-2

-2=-k-2, k=0, not good.

Perhaps not in the same form.

For ring 3, k=3, S(2)=19, first cell 20.

Cells: s=0: i=0: (1,1-3)=(1,-2)

i=1: (2,-1)

i=2: (3,0)

s=1: i=0: (3,0) overlap? or (3,0)

In our case, for s=1: q=k-i=3-i, r=i+1

i=0: (3,1)

i=1: (2,2)

i=2: (1,3)

s=2: q=-1-i, r=3-i

i=0: (-1,3)

i=1: (-2,2)

i=2: (-3,1)

s=3: q=-3, r=-i

i=0: (-3,0)

i=1: (-3,-1)

i=2: (-3,-2)

s=4: q=-3+i, r=-3-i

i=0: (-3,-3)

i=1: (-2,-4)

i=2: (-1,-5)

s=5: q=i+1, r=-3

i=0: (1,-3)

i=1: (2,-3)

i=2: (3,-3)

Now cell at (-1,-2): not in this list. Closest is s=3 i=1: (-3,-1), s=4 i=0: (-3,-3), etc.

Perhaps s=4 for k=3: q=-3+i, r=-3-i, i=0: (-3,-3), i=1: (-2,-4), i=2: (-1,-5)

Not (-1,-2)

s=5: (1,-3),(2,-3),(3,-3)

Not.

s=3: (-3,0),(-3,-1),(-3,-2)

So (-3,-2) is there, for i=2.

But we need (-1,-2)

So not in ring 3.

Ring 4: k=4, S(3)=37, cells 38 to 37+6*4=37+24=61? S(4)=1+3*4*5=1+60=61, cells 38 to 61.

s=0: i=0: (1,1-4)=(1,-3)

i=1: (2,-2)

i=2: (3,-1)

i=3: (4,0)

s=1: i=0: (4,0) overlap? q=k-i=4-i, r=i+1

i=0: (4,1)

i=1: (3,2)

i=2: (2,3)

i=3: (1,4)

s=2: q=-1-i, r=4-i

i=0: (-1,4)

i=1: (-2,3)

i=2: (-3,2)

i=3: (-4,1)

s=3: q=-4, r=-i

i=0: (-4,0)

i=1: (-4,-1)

i=2: (-4,-2)

i=3: (-4,-3)

s=4: q=-4+i, r=-4-i

i=0: (-4,-4)

i=1: (-3,-5)

i=2: (-2,-6)

i=3: (-1,-7)

s=5: q=i+1, r=-4

i=0: (1,-4)

i=1: (2,-4)

i=2: (3,-4)

i=3: (4,-4)

Now cell at (-1,-2) is not in this list. Closest is s=4 i=3: (-1,-7), not.

Perhaps it is in a different sector or ring.

For (-1,-2), distance d=max(1,2,3)=3, so ring 3 or 4.

In ring 3, we have cells like (-3,-2), not (-1,-2)

In ring 4, not present.

Perhaps s=4 for k=3: q=-k+i, r=-k-i = -3+i, -3-i

For i=2: (-1,-5), not.

Or for k=4, s= something.

Perhaps the formula is only for the cells on the spiral path, but all cells are covered.

For (-1,-2), let's find which cell it is.

From the filling order, after cell 16 at (-2,-1), then cell 17 at (-1,-2), cell 18 at (0,-2), etc.

In ring 2, cell 16 at (-2,-1), cell 17 at (-1,-2), cell 18 at (0,-2), cell 19 at (1,-2)

For cell 17 at (-1,-2)

Ring k=2, since S(1)=7, cells 8 to 19 in ring 2.

p = 17 - 7 =10? S(k-1)=S(1)=7, n=17, p=17-7=10

s = floor((10-1)/2)=floor(9/2)=4

i = (10-1) mod 2 =9 mod 2=1

For s=4: q = -k + i = -2 + i, r = -k - i = -2 - i

i=1: q=-2+1=-1, r=-2-1=-3? but we have r=-2, not -3.

In our earlier list for ring 2, s=4: cells 16 and 17 at (-2,-1) and (-1,-2)? In the list I had cell 16 at (-2,-1), cell 17 at (-1,-2)

For s=4: q = -k + i, r = -k - i

k=2, i=0: q=-2+0=-2, r=-2-0=-2? but in list (-2,-1),
