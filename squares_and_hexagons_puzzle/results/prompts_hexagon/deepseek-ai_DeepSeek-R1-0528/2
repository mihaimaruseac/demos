<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is constructed on a hexagonal grid.

From the example, it starts with 1 in the center, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on, spiraling outward. Looking at the snippet:

- Above 1 is 3? Let me sketch this out.

The grid is shown as:

... 14  4  3  10 ...

.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, centered around 1:

- To the right: 2

- Above right: 3? But 3 is above and to the right? In hexagonal grids, neighbors are typically adjacent in six directions.

Assuming a flat-topped hexagon layout, each hexagon has neighbors: up-left, up-right, left, right, down-left, down-right.

Looking at the numbers:

Around 1: we have 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the diagram, it shows:

Directly above 1? The diagram has numbers above and below.

From the text:

The row above: 14,4,3,10 but that's not complete.

The row with 1: 15,5,1,2,9

Row below: 16,6,7,8

So, relative to 1:

- Right: 2

- Down-right: 9? But 9 is to the right and down? In the same row as 2, but further right? This is messy.

Perhaps the grid is oriented such that the rows are horizontal.

In the row containing 1: we have 15,5,1,2,9

So left to right: 15,5,1,2,9

Then above: 14,4,3,10

Below: 16,6,7,8

Now, let's see neighbors of 1.

Assuming hexagonal adjacency, each cell has six neighbors.

For cell 1, it should have neighbors: let's say north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, northwest.

Typically in hex grids, directions are relative.

From the numbers, what is adjacent to 1?

Looking at position: 1 is at center.

To its right is 2.

Above it, in the row above, directly above should be the cell that is north. In the row above, we have 14,4,3,10. Which one is directly above 1? Probably 3 or 4? 4 is above 5, and 5 is left of 1, so perhaps 4 is northwest of 1, and 3 is north of 1? But 3 is to the right of 4, so if 5 is left of 1, then 4 is above-left of 1, and 3 is above 1? But then what is above-right? 10 is far right.

This is confusing. Perhaps the rows are offset.

In many hexagonal grids, rows are offset, like every other row is shifted.

In this case, the row above has four numbers: 14,4,3,10

The center row has five numbers: 15,5,1,2,9

The row below has four numbers: 16,6,7,8

So likely, the center row is longer, and rows above and below are shorter, which is typical for a spiral starting from center.

Probably, the grid is such that the center row has one cell, but here it has multiple, but 1 is not alone.

Perhaps 1 is the center, and it has neighbors in all directions.

Let me list the neighbors of 1 based on the diagram.

From the diagram, directly right of 1 is 2.

Directly left? 5 is left of 1.

Above: in the row above, which cell is above 1? Since the row above has cells aligned with the gaps, probably above 1 is between 4 and 3 or something.

Typically, in flat-topped hex grid, if center row has cells at (0,0), then neighbors are at (0,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1) or something. I need a coordinate system.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, there are known sequences for the ring numbers.

Perhaps I can find a way to determine the ring number for each number.

The spiral starts at 1, then it goes to 2,3,4, etc.

From the diagram, after 1, it goes to 2 (right), then 3 (up-right), then 4 (up-left), then 5 (left), then 6 (down-left), then 7 (down-right), then 8 (right), then 9 (right), but 9 is next to 2, so probably after 7 it goes to 8, then to 9, but 9 is to the right of 2, so perhaps it's spiraling out.

Let me try to list the order from the diagram.

Start at 1.

Next number is 2, to the right.

Then from 2, it goes up to 3? But in the diagram, 3 is above and left of 2? Let's see positions.

Assume the center row is y=0, with x-coordinates.

Set 1 at (0,0).

Right of 1 is 2, so (1,0)? But in hex grid, coordinates might be different.

In axial coordinates for hex grid, we can use (q,r) with q+r+s=0, but perhaps simpler to use offset coordinates.

From the diagram:

- At (0,0): 1

- At (1,0): 2 (right)

- At (1,1): 3? But above-right.

In the row above (y=1), we have cells. The row above has x-coordinates: let's say from left to right: 14 at say (-2,1)? But we don't have full grid.

From the sequence: after 1 is 2, then 3 is next, and in diagram 3 is above 1 and right of 5? This is messy.

Let's list the numbers in order as they are placed.

Start with 1 at center.

Then move right to 2.

Then move up-right to 3? But in diagram, 3 is above 1, and 1 has left 5, so if 2 is right, 5 is left, then above should be between them.

After 2, the next number is 3, which is not adjacent to 2 in the diagram? 2 has right 9, down 8? But 3 is not directly adjacent to 2 in the given snippet.

In the row above, 3 is there, and below 1 is 6,7,8.

Perhaps from 2, it moves up to 3. But in the diagram, above 2 should be a cell. If 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then above 2 might be (1,1) or (0,1), but (0,1) might be above 1.

Assume that the grid is flat-topped, and rows are horizontal.

For a cell at (x,y), neighbors are (x+1,y), (x,y+1), (x-1,y+1), (x-1,y), (x,y-1), (x+1,y-1) or something like that. I need to recall the standard axial coordinates.

I recall that for a hexagonal spiral, the numbers on each "ring" can be determined.

The center is ring 0, with 1 number: 1.

Then ring 1 has 6 numbers: 2 to 7.

Ring 2 has 12 numbers: 8 to 19.

Ring 3 has 18 numbers: 20 to 37, and so on.

Let me verify with the diagram.

In diagram, around 1: we have 2,3,4,5,6,7, which are the neighbors, and they are ring 1.

Then next numbers: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc.

In diagram, we see 8,9,10,14,15,16, so probably ring 2 has 12 numbers from 8 to 19.

In diagram: below we have 8,7,6,16? Row below: 16,6,7,8 — so 6,7,8 are there, but 6 and 7 are part of ring 1, since they are neighbors of 1.

Ring 1 is numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Then ring 2 should be the next layer, numbers 8 to 19.

In the diagram: above we have 14,4,3,10 — 4 and 3 are ring 1, so 14 and 10 are ring 2.

Similarly, left: 15,5 — 5 is ring 1, so 15 is ring 2.

Right: 2,9 — 2 is ring 1, 9 is ring 2.

Below: 16,6,7,8 — 6,7 ring 1, 16 and 8 ring 2? 8 is probably ring 2.

But 8 is next to 7, which is ring 1, so yes.

Now, what is the sequence? After 7, it goes to 8. In diagram, 8 is below-right of 7? 7 is at, say, down-left of 1.

Set coordinates.

Assume 1 at (0,0).

Let’s say neighbor in direction (1,0) is east: 2.

Then northeast: say (1,1) or (0,1). Standard axial coordinates: let q be column, r be row.

Define: for a hex grid, use cube coordinates where x+y+z=0.

Set center: (0,0,0).

Then neighbors: (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1).

But perhaps easier to map to a spiral sequence.

From the diagram, the neighbors of 1 are: left:5, right:2, up-left:4? up-right:3? down-left:6? down-right:7?

Confirm:

In row above: 14,4,3,10. Since 4 and 3 are neighbors of 1, and 1 is below, probably 4 is northwest, 3 is northeast.

Similarly, center row: 15,5,1,2,9 — 5 west, 2 east.

Below: 16,6,7,8 — 6 southwest, 7 southeast.

So neighbors of 1:

- NW: 4? But NW should be above-left. From center, NW is (-1,1) or something.

Assign directions:

- East (E): (1,0) : 2

- West (W): (-1,0) : 5

- Northeast (NE): (0,1) or (1,1)? Typically in flat-top, NE is (1,-1) or (0,-1)? I need to be consistent.

Assume that from (0,0), moving east increases q, moving northeast increases r, but in axial, often q and r.

Set q and r such that:

- E: (q+1,r)

- W: (q-1,r)

- NE: (q,r+1) ? But then distance not symmetric.

Better to use cube coordinates.

Define vectors:

Let direction vectors:

- E: (1, -1, 0) ? Standard cube: x+y+z=0.

Set:

- East: (1, -1, 0)

- Northeast: (1, 0, -1)

- Northwest: (0, 1, -1)

- West: (-1, 1, 0)

- Southwest: (-1, 0, 1)

- Southeast: (0, -1, 1)

But sum must be zero.

Standard: the six directions:

(1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)

Yes.

Now, for center (0,0,0), neighbors:

(1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)

In the diagram, which is which?

We have numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

From the spiral path: it starts at 1, moves to 2 (say east), then to 3 (say northeast), then to 4 (northwest), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (southwest), then to 7 (southeast), then to 8 (east again, but from 7).

After 7, it should go to 8. In diagram, 8 is below 7? 7 is at, say, southeast of 1, so from 7, moving east would be to 8, but in diagram, 8 is to the right of 7, and since below row has 6,7,8, so yes, from 7 to 8 east.

Then from 8 to 9? 9 is to the right of 2, so east of 2? But 2 is at east of 1, so from 8, it might move northeast to 9 or something.

In the center row, after 2 is 9, so probably from 8 it moves north to 9 or northeast.

The sequence after 7 is 8, then 9,10, etc.

In diagram, after 8 is 9? But 9 is not adjacent to 8; 8 is at (say) (2,-1, -1) or something.

Perhaps I need to define the path.

From the initial placement:

- Start at 1: (0,0,0)

- Move east to 2: so 2 at (1,-1,0)

- Then move northeast to 3: northeast is (1,0,-1), so 3 at (1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-1,-1)? But sum 2-1-1=0 ok.

- Then from 3, move northwest to 4: northwest is (0,1,-1), so (2,-1,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (2,0,-2)

- Then from 4, move west to 5: west is (-1,1,0), so (2,0,-2) + (-1,1,0) = (1,1,-2)

- Then from 5, move southwest to 6: southwest is (-1,0,1), so (1,1,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (0,1,-1)

- Then from 6, move southeast to 7: southeast is (0,-1,1), so (0,1,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,0,0)? Oh no, back to center, but center is occupied.

Mistake in directions.

From 5 to 6: in diagram, 6 is below-left, which might be southwest, but from (1,1,-2) to (0,1,-1), which is vector (-1,0,1), which is southwest, yes.

Then from 6 at (0,1,-1), move to 7. In diagram, 7 is below-right of 1, so southeast. Southeast is (0,-1,1), so (0,1,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,0,0), but that's the center, occupied by 1. But in reality, it should be to a new cell.

Perhaps the direction is wrong. After 6, it should go to a cell south of 6 or something.

In the diagram, 6 is southwest of 1, 7 is southeast of 1, so from 6 to 7, it might be moving east, but in hex grid, from (0,1,-1) to east (1,-1,0) would be (1,0,-1), which is different.

Perhaps from 6, it moves south or southeast.

Let's calculate the coordinate for 6. If 1 at (0,0,0), 5 at (1,1,-2)? Earlier I have 5 at (1,1,-2), 6 at (0,1,-1).

Now, the cell southeast of 6: southeast is (0,-1,1), so (0,1,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,0,0), occupied.

Southwest is (-1,0,1), so ( -1,1,0), which might be where? Or perhaps I have the directions mixed.

Perhaps for the spiral, it moves in a different order.

From the diagram, after 6, it goes to 7, which is adjacent to 6 and to 1.

From 6 at (0,1,-1), the neighbor in the direction of 1 is (0,0,0), but occupied, so it must be another direction.

Perhaps the coordinate for 6 is wrong.

Let's start over.

Set 1 at (0,0,0).

2 at east: (1,-1,0)

3 at northeast of 2? Or of 1? The spiral moves from 2 to 3, and 3 is not adjacent to 1? In diagram, 3 is adjacent to 1, since it's a neighbor.

In the snippet, 1 is adjacent to 2,3,4,5,6,7, so all are neighbors.

So from 1, 2 is at (1,-1,0), then 3 must be at another neighbor, say (1,0,-1), which is northeast.

Then 4 at another, say (0,1,-1) northwest.

Then 5 at (-1,1,0) west.

Then 6 at (-1,0,1) southwest.

Then 7 at (0,-1,1) southeast.

Sum check: (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1) all sum to 0, good.

Now, after 7 at (0,-1,1), the next number is 8. Where is 8? In diagram, 8 is below 7, and in the same row as 7, but to the right? Below row has 16,6,7,8, so 6 at say (-1,0,1), 7 at (0,-1,1), 8 at (1,-2,1)? Or something.

From 7, the spiral moves. Typically, it would move to the next cell in the outer ring. From 7, it might move east to 8, but east from (0,-1,1) is (1,-1,0) + wait, direction east is (1,-1,0), so (0,-1,1) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-2,1), sum 1-2+1=0.

Then 8 at (1,-2,1)

Then from 8 to 9. 9 is in the center row, to the right of 2. 2 is at (1,-1,0), so east of 2 would be (2,-1,-1)? But 3 is at (1,0,-1), not (2,-1,-1).

In diagram, 9 is to the right of 2, so if 2 is at (1,-1,0), then east would be (2,-1,-1)? But earlier for 3 I have (1,0,-1), which is different.

Perhaps from 8, it moves north or northeast to 9.

9 is adjacent to 2, and 2 is at (1,-1,0), so 9 could be at (2,-1,-1) or (1,-2,1) or (2,-2,0) etc.

From the sequence, after 8 is 9, and in diagram 8 and 9 are not directly adjacent; 8 is below, 9 is above-right.

Perhaps the path is from 7 to 8 east, then from 8 to the cell above it, which is 9? But in hex grid, above might be north.

From 7 at (0,-1,1), move east to 8 at (1,-2,1)

Then from 8, move northeast to 9. Northeast is (1,0,-1), so (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0)

Then 9 at (2,-2,0)

Then from 9 to 10. 10 is in the row above, to the right of 3. 3 is at (1,0,-1), so east of 3 is (2,0,-2)? Or northeast.

In diagram, 10 is to the right of 3, and 3 is at top, so probably east.

So from 9 at (2,-2,0), move to 10 at say (2,-1,-1) or (3,-2,-1) etc.

Assume move north or northeast.

From 9, it might move to the cell north of it, which might be 10.

North could be (0,1,-1) or something, but in cube, no direct north.

From (2,-2,0), the neighbor in the direction of increasing r or something.

Perhaps continue the pattern.

From the initial move, after placing the first ring, when moving to the second ring, it starts from the southeast cell or something.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the number of cells in ring k is 6k for k≥1, with ring 0 having 1 cell.

Ring 0: k=0, 1 cell: number 1.

Ring 1: k=1, 6 cells: numbers 2 to 7.

Ring 2: k=2, 12 cells: numbers 8 to 19.

Ring 3: k=3, 18 cells: numbers 20 to 37.

And so on. The last number of ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Sum from i=1 to k of 6i = 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 3k(k+1)

So last number of ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1 + 0 =1, good.

k=1: 1 + 3*1*2 =1+6=7, good.

k=2:1+3*2*3=1+18=19, good.

k=3:1+3*3*4=1+36=37, good.

Now, the first number of ring k is last of ring k-1 plus 1 = 1 + 3(k-1)k +1 = 3k(k-1) +2

For k=1: 3*1*0 +2=2, good.

k=2:3*2*1+2=6+2=8, good.

k=3:3*3*2+2=18+2=20, good.

Now, for a given number n, find which ring it is in.

Solve for k such that first of ring k ≤ n ≤ last of ring k.

First k: a_k = 3k(k-1) + 2

Last k: b_k = 3k(k+1) +1

Set a_k ≤ n ≤ b_k

a_k = 3k^2 - 3k + 2

b_k = 3k^2 + 3k +1

So solve 3k^2 - 3k +2 ≤ n ≤ 3k^2 + 3k +1

Since b_k - a_k = 6k, which is the size.

For large n, k ≈ sqrt(n/3)

But for n=2026, compute k.

Set 3k^2 - 3k +2 ≤ 2026 ≤ 3k^2 + 3k +1

First, solve 3k^2 + 3k +1 ≥ 2026

3k^2 + 3k -2025 ≥0

k^2 + k -675 ≥0

k ≥ [-1 + sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 + sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), 52^2=2704, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97, so k≥ [-1+51.97]/2≈50.97/2≈25.485

So k≥26? Let me compute.

k=25: b_k=3*25*26 +1=3*650+1=1950+1=1951

1951 < 2026? 1951 < 2026, yes.

a_k for k=26: a_26=3*26*25 +2=3*650+2=1950+2=1952

b_26=3*26*27 +1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107

1952 ≤ 2026 ≤ 2107? Yes, since 1952<2026<2107.

So n=2026 is in ring k=26.

First number of ring 26 is 1952, last is 2107.

Now, the ring has 6*26=156 cells.

Now, I need to find the position of 2026 in this ring.

The ring starts at some cell and spirals around.

Typically, each ring starts at the cell immediately to the right of the "start" of the previous ring, but in hexagonal spiral, it often starts at the southeast or east-southeast cell.

In the first ring, it started at east of center: cell 2 at (1,-1,0)

Then ring 2 starts at southeast of center? Cell 8 is at, from earlier, but we need to find.

Generally, the starting cell of ring k.

For ring k, it starts at a cell that is k steps in a certain direction from center.

For example, ring 0: (0,0,0)

Ring 1: starts at (1,-1,0) east.

Ring 2: starts at (1,-2,1)? Earlier I had 8 at (1,-2,1) or something.

In ring 1, the cells are at Manhattan distance 1 from center.

In hex grid, the distance is max(|dx|,|dy|,|dz|) but since x+y+z=0, distance d = (|x|+|y|+|z|)/2.

For a cell at (x,y,z), distance to center is (|x|+|y|+|z|)/2.

For ring k, distance is k.

The starting point is often at (k, -k, 0) or something.

For k=1: (1,-1,0) which is distance (1+1+0)/2=1, good.

For k=2: perhaps (2,-2,0)? Distance (2+2+0)/2=2.

But earlier, I thought 8 is at (1,-2,1), distance (1+2+1)/2=4/2=2, same.

(2,-2,0) also distance 2.

But which one? In the spiral, ring 2 starts after ring 1 ends at 7 at (0,-1,1)

Then it moves to the next cell, which is east of 7: (0,-1,1) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-2,1), so (1,-2,1)

Whereas (2,-2,0) is different.

So for ring k, it starts at (k, -k, 0)? For k=2, (2,-2,0), but we have (1,-2,1), which is different coordinate.

Note that (1,-2,1) and (2,-2,0) are both at distance 2, but different positions.

In fact, (2,-2,0) = (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) - something, but they are adjacent? Vector between: (2,-2,0) - (1,-2,1) = (1,0,-1), which is a neighbor direction, so yes, adjacent.

But in the spiral, it starts at (1,-2,1) for ring 2.

Similarly, for ring 1, started at (1,-1,0)

Now for ring k, it seems to start at (k, -k, 0)? But for k=1: (1,-1,0), good.

k=2: (2,-2,0), but earlier I thought 8 is at (1,-2,1), contradiction.

Perhaps (k, -k+1, -1) or something.

Let's compute the starting cell.

From the path: after ring 1 ends at 7 at (0,-1,1)

Then it moves east to 8 at (1,-2,1)

So for ring k, it starts at (k, -k, 1)? For k=2: (2,-2,1), but we have (1,-2,1), not matching.

k=2: (1,-2,1), which is (k, -k-1? k=2, -3? no.

Note that the starting cell for ring k is at direction southeast or something.

From center, the starting cell of ring k is obtained by moving k steps in the east direction? But for k=1, one step east: (1,-1,0)

For k=2, two steps east: (2,-2,0), but we have (1,-2,1), which is not (2,-2,0).

Perhaps it's moving k-1 steps in one direction and then one in another.

I recall that in many spirals, the start of ring k is at the cell that is "south" of the start of ring k-1, but adjusted.

For ring k, the starting cell has coordinates (k, -k, 0) ? But for k=2, (2,-2,0), distance 2, but in our case it's (1,-2,1).

(1,-2,1) = - ( -1,2,-1) but not helpful.

Note that (1,-2,1) and (2,-2,0) are both valid, but in the spiral, it starts at (1,-2,1).

Perhaps the starting direction changes.

Another way: the ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

For ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells.

The spiral starts at the "southeast" corner or something.

For ring k, the first cell is at position relative to center.

From the end of previous ring.

The last cell of ring k-1 is at a certain position.

For example, ring 1 ends at 7 at (0,-1,1)

Then ring 2 starts at (1,-2,1), which is east of it.

Similarly, ring 2 has 12 cells. It starts at 8 at (1,-2,1), then moves to 9 at (2,-2,0) or something.

Earlier I had from 8 to 9: if 8 at (1,-2,1), and move northeast to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0)

Then 9 at (2,-2,0)

Then to 10: probably north or northwest. In diagram, 10 is above 3, and 3 is at (1,0,-1), so if 9 is at (2,-2,0), move to (2,-1,-1) or (1,-1,0) but occupied.

Move northwest to (2,-2,0) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-1,-1)

Then 10 at (2,-1,-1)

Then to 11: continue, but in diagram we have 14,4,3,10, so 10 is there, next might be 11 at (1,-1,-1) or something.

From (2,-1,-1), move west to (1,-1,0) but that's 2, occupied, so must move another direction.

Typically, after moving in a direction for k steps, it turns.

For ring k, it starts, and moves in 6 directions for k steps each, but the first direction might be different.

General rule: for ring k, it starts at the cell in the direction of the first move from the end of previous ring.

But consistently, from the end of ring k-1, which is at a certain position, it moves east to start ring k.

For ring k-1, it ends at a cell that is southwest or something.

For ring 1, ends at (0,-1,1) which is southeast.

Then moves east to (1,-2,1) for start of ring 2.

Similarly, ring 2 ends at? After 8,9,10,... to 19.

The last cell of ring 2 should be at the "end" of the spiral.

From start (1,-2,1), it might move northeast for k=2 steps? But k=2, so two cells: to (2,-2,0), then to (3,-2,-1)? But then not closing.

Typically, for ring k, it moves in six directions: for example, east for k steps, then northwest for k steps, then west for k steps, etc., but adjusted.

Standard hexagonal spiral path: after the start, it moves in the direction that is 60 degrees counterclockwise from the previous direction.

From the start of ring k, which is at east of the end of previous ring, so it has just moved east to get there.

Then it turns counterclockwise to the next direction. In hex grid, counterclockwise turn: from east, counterclockwise would be northeast.

So it moves northeast for k steps.

Then from there, turn counterclockwise to north? Directions: east, then northeast, then northwest, then west, southwest, southeast, back to east.

The sequence of directions: let's list the six directions in order.

Define the six directions in counterclockwise order: say E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE.

So order: E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE.

For ring k, it starts by moving E to the start cell. But it's already at the start cell when it arrives.

When it arrives at the start cell, it has just moved E. Then it turns to NE and moves k steps in NE direction? But for k=1, it would move one step NE, but in ring 1, after start at E, it moved to NE (3), then to NW (4), etc.

For ring k, the number of steps in each direction is k for each of the six directions? But total cells would be 6k, yes.

But for the first move, when it starts, it is at the start cell, and it moves to the next cell in the first direction.

For ring k, it begins at cell S_k, then moves in direction D1 for k steps to k cells, then D2 for k steps, etc.

The directions are fixed relative to the ring.

For ring k, the starting direction is always east, and it moves east for k steps? But for k=1, it moves east for 1 step, but it is already at the east cell, so moving east would go to a cell further east, but in ring 1, after start at (1,-1,0), it moves to NE to (1,0,-1), not east.

So not.

Perhaps it moves in the directions starting from NE or something.

Let's see for ring 1: starts at (1,-1,0) (east of center).

Then moves to 3 at (1,0,-1), which is NE of it? From (1,-1,0), NE is (1,0,-1), yes.

Then to 4 at (0,1,-1), which is NW of (1,0,-1)? NW is (0,1,-1), yes.

Then to 5 at (-1,1,0), W of (0,1,-1)? W is (-1,1,0), yes.

Then to 6 at (-1,0,1), SW of (-1,1,0)? SW is (-1,0,1), yes.

Then to 7 at (0,-1,1), SE of (-1,0,1)? SE is (0,-1,1), yes.

So for ring 1 (k=1), it moves: NE, NW, W, SW, SE. But it started at E, but didn't move E; the first move is NE.

The start cell is already placed, and it moves to the next cells.

For ring k, after arriving at S_k, it moves in the following sequence of directions for k steps each: NE, NW, W, SW, SE, and then finally E, but for the next ring.

After placing the last cell of the ring, it moves E to start the next ring.

For ring k, the moves are: first move NE for k steps, then NW for k steps, then W for k steps, then SW for k steps, then SE for k steps, and then after that, it would move E to start ring k+1, but that move is part of the next ring's start.

So for the cells in ring k, they are placed by moving in the six directions, but only five moves? No, each "move" for k steps places k cells.

When it moves in a direction for k steps, it places k cells: the first step moves to a new cell and places it, then second step to another, etc.

For example, in ring 1, k=1:

Start at S_1 = (1,-1,0)

Then move NE: to (1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-1,-1)? No, the direction vector is (1,0,-1) for NE.

From current position, add the direction vector.

From S_1 = (1,-1,0), move NE: add (1,0,-1) = (2,-1,-1), but in our case, cell 3 is at (1,0,-1), which is different.

(1,0,-1) - (1,-1,0) = (0,1,-1), which is NW, not NE.

Mistake.

From (1,-1,0) to (1,0,-1): difference (0,1,-1), which is the NW direction.

But earlier I said it moved to NE, but vector is NW.

Inconsistency in direction naming.

Let's clarify the directions.

From a cell, the six neighbors:

Let P be a cell.

The neighbors are:

- E: (1,-1,0)

- NE: (1,0,-1)

- NW: (0,1,-1)

- W: (-1,1,0)

- SW: (-1,0,1)

- SE: (0,-1,1)

From center (0,0,0):

- E: (1,-1,0)

- NE: (1,0,-1)

- NW: (0,1,-1)

- W: (-1,1,0)

- SW: (-1,0,1)

- SE: (0,-1,1)

In the spiral for ring 1:

Start at S_1 = (1,-1,0) which is E of center.

Then it moves to 3 at (1,0,-1) which is NE of S_1? From S_1 (1,-1,0), NE is (1,0,-1) - (1,-1,0) = (0,1,-1)? No, the vector from S_1 to the neighbor.

The cell at NE of S_1 is S_1 + (1,0,-1) = (1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-1,-1)

But in reality, it moved to (1,0,-1), which is S_1 + (0,1,-1) = (1,-1,0) + (0,1,-1) = (1,0,-1), and (0,1,-1) is the NW direction.

So it moved NW, not NE.

But (1,0,-1) is the NE neighbor of the center, but from S_1, it is the NW neighbor.

So in terms of absolute directions, but for the path, it's relative.

In the spiral path, from the start cell, it moves in a relative direction.

For ring k, after arriving at S_k, it moves in the "left" or "counterclockwise" direction relative to the approach.

In this case, it arrived at S_k by moving E (from the end of previous ring).

Then it turns counterclockwise, which from E, counterclockwise is NE.

But in the move, it moved to the NW cell, which is not NE.

Perhaps the turn is 60 degrees, but in which way.

From the approach direction: it arrived by moving E, so it came from west. Then it turns counterclockwise, so instead of continuing east, it turns to the northeast direction.

But in this case, from S_k, moving NE would be to (2,-1,-1) for k=1, but it moved to (1,0,-1), which is not NE.

Perhaps for the first move, it moves in the direction perpendicular.

Let's list the move vectors for ring 1:

From S_1 (1,-1,0), it moves to (1,0,-1) — vector (0,1,-1) which is NW.

Then from there to (0,1,-1) — vector (-1,1,0) which is W? (0,1,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (-1,2,-1), but it went to (0,1,-1) to (-1,1,0), vector (-1,0,1)? Let's calculate:

From cell 3 at (1,0,-1) to cell 4 at (0,1,-1): (0,1,-1) - (1,0,-1) = (-1,1,0), which is W direction.

Then from 4 (0,1,-1) to 5 (-1,1,0): (-1,1,0) - (0,1,-1) = (-1,0,1), SW direction.

Then from 5 (-1,1,0) to 6 (-1,0,1): (-1,0,1) - (-1,1,0) = (0,-1,1), SE direction.

Then from 6 (-1,0,1) to 7 (0,-1,1): (0,-1,1) - (-1,0,1) = (1,-1,0), E direction.

So the move vectors are: NW, W, SW, SE, E.

For ring 1, moves: NW, W, SW, SE, E.

But it has 5 moves for 6 cells? No, each move is to a new cell, so from start, first move to second cell, second move to third, etc., so for 6 cells, there are 5 moves, but it should be 6 cells placed, but the start cell is already placed when it arrives, so for the ring, it places k cells per "leg", but with 6 legs, but for k=1, each leg has one cell, but here it seems only 5 moves.

For ring 1: cells placed: S_1 is cell 2, then move to cell 3, then to 4, then to 5, then to 6, then to 7. So cells 2 to 7, 6 cells, with 5 moves: from 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7.

So the moves are between cells, but for the direction of movement, it's the vector from current to next.

For ring k, there are 6k cells, and 6k-1 moves, but for the path, it has 6 segments, each consisting of k moves? For k=1, each "segment" has only one move, but there are 5 moves for 6 cells, not 6.

Perhaps the ring is traversed with 6 sides, each side has k cells, but the cells are shared, so for each side, there are k cells, but the corner cells are shared, so total cells 6k for k>0.

For a side of length k, there are k cells along the side.

For example, in ring 1, k=1, each "side" has 1 cell, total 6 cells.

The path goes from one corner to the next.

The corners are the vertices.

For ring k, there are 6 corner cells.

The spiral path goes along each side between corners.

From the start corner, it moves along the first side for k cells, but since it starts at a corner, and ends at the next corner, it places k cells for that side, including the start and end? But that would double-count.

Typically, in such spirals, the path starts at a corner cell, then moves along the side, placing the next k-1 cells for that side, then at the next corner, turns, and so on.

For ring k, it starts at a corner cell S_k.

Then it moves in a certain direction to place the next cell, and continues for k-1 steps in that direction, placing k-1 cells, reaching the next corner.

Then turns, and moves in the next direction for k steps? Let's see for k=2.

For ring 2, starts at 8 at (1,-2,1) as we had.

Then it moves to 9. In diagram, 9 is at, say, (2,-2,0) or (1,-1,0) but occupied.

From earlier assumption, from 8 at (1,-2,1), move to 9 at (2,-2,0) by adding (1,0,-1) which is NE.

Then from 9 to 10. 10 is at (2,-1,-1)? By adding (0,1,-1) NW? (2,-2,0) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-1,-1)

Then from 10 to 11. If continue, to (1,-1,-1) or (2,0,-2), but in diagram, after 10 is not shown, but probably to (1,-1,-1) by adding (-1,1,0) W? (2,-1,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (1,0,-1) but that's cell 3, occupied, so must be to (2,0,-2) by adding (0,1,-1) again, but that would be NW again, but should turn.

After placing 10 at (2,-1,-1), it should turn to the next direction.

In ring 1, after placing a cell, it turned at each step since k=1.

For k=2, after placing the first cell of the side, it may not turn immediately.

General rule: for each side, it places k cells in a straight line.

For the first side, it places k cells, starting from S_k.

For ring 2, k=2, S_k = 8 at (1,-2,1)

First side: say in NE direction. Move to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 9.

Then move again in same direction to (2,-2,0) + (1,0,-1) = (3,-2,-1) cell 10? But in diagram, 10 is at (2,-1,-1) or something else.

But earlier I thought 10 is at (2,-1,-1), which is not (3,-2,-1).

Perhaps the direction is different.

Assume that for ring k, the first move is in the NE direction for k steps.

For k=2, from S_k (1,-2,1), move NE to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 9.

Then move NE again to (2,-2,0) + (1,0,-1) = (3,-2,-1) cell 10.

Then from 10, turn to next direction, say NW, move to (3,-2,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (3,-1,-2) cell 11.

Then again NW to (3,-1,-2) + (0,1,-1) = (3,0,-3) cell 12.

Then turn to W, move to (3,0,-3) + (-1,1,0) = (2,1,-3) cell 13.

And so on.

In our diagram, for the top row, we have 14,4,3,10. 4 and 3 are ring 1, 14 and 10 are ring 2. If 10 is at (3,-2,-1), but in the diagram it's next to 3 at (1,0,-1), which is not adjacent to (3,-2,-1), since distance |3-1| + |-2-0| + |-1-(-1)| =2+2+0=4, distance 2, not adjacent. So probably not.

Perhaps the first move is in a different direction.

For ring 2, it starts at 8 at (1,-2,1), then moves to 9 at (1,-1,0) but that's cell 2, occupied, impossible.

Or to (2,-2,0), as before.

Perhaps to (0,-2,2) or other.

Another idea: in many sources, the hexagonal spiral is standardized, and the coordinates can be calculated.

I recall that the position can be found by finding the ring and then the sector.

For a number n, in ring k, with a_k ≤ n ≤ b_k.

The offset in the ring is m = n - a_k + 1, so m=1 to 6k.

Then the cell is at position based on m.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k cells.

The first side is from m=1 to m=k, and it is in the NE direction or something.

For example, in ring 1, m=1: cell 2 at (1,-1,0) E

m=2: cell 3 at (1,0,-1) NE

m=3: cell 4 at (0,1,-1) NW

m=4: cell 5 at (-1,1,0) W

m=5: cell 6 at (-1,0,1) SW

m=6: cell 7 at (0,-1,1) SE

So for m=1: E

m=2: NE

m=3: NW

m=4: W

m=5: SW

m=6: SE

But this is for k=1, and each m is a different direction, but for larger k, each side has k cells in the same direction.

For ring k, the first k cells are in one direction, next k in another, etc.

For ring 2, k=2, a_k=8, b_k=19, so m=1 to 12.

Cells 8 to 19.

From earlier, 8 at (1,-2,1) SE? Or what.

Assume that the first cell m=1 is at the "southeast" or "east" cell.

From the end of previous ring, it moved E to start, so S_k is at E of the end of previous ring.

For ring 1, ended at 7 at (0,-1,1) SE

Moved E to (0,-1,1) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-2,1) which is cell 8.

Now, this cell (1,-2,1) is at distance 2, and in the SE direction? From center, (1,-2,1), sum 0, |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, distance 2.

The direction from center: the vector (1,-2,1), which is not a pure direction; it's a combination.

The sector can be determined by the angle, but in hex, by the dominant coordinate.

For ring k, the starting cell S_k is at (k, -k, 0) + something, but for k=2, (2,-2,0), but we have (1,-2,1), which is different.

Note that (1,-2,1) = (2,-2,0) + (-1,0,1) , not helpful.

The cell S_k for ring k is at (k, -k, 0) for k even or something, but k=1: (1,-1,0) good, k=2: (2,-2,0), but we need (1,-2,1).

Perhaps it's (k, -k, 0) for all k, but for k=2, (2,-2,0), but in our path, it's at (1,-2,1), which is adjacent, so perhaps it's equivalent, but for the spiral path, it starts at (1,-2,1), not (2,-2,0).

For the position, it doesn't matter as long as we can find the neighbors, but for the path, we need to know the order.

For finding the neighbors of a cell, we need its coordinates, then we can find the six adjacent cells.

So perhaps for a given n, find its ring k, then its offset m, then its coordinates.

For ring k, the cells are at distance k from center.

The number of cells at distance k is 6k for k>0.

The cells can be parameterized by an angle or by a sector.

The starting cell S_k is at (k, -k, 0) ? But for k=1: (1,-1,0) good.

For k=2: (2,-2,0)

But in our case, for ring 2, cell 8 is at (1,-2,1), which is not (2,-2,0).

However, (1,-2,1) and (2,-2,0) are both at distance 2, and they are adjacent, so for the purpose of finding neighbors, as long as we know the coordinates, we can compute, but the actual position for cell 8 is (1,-2,1), not (2,-2,0), so we need the correct one.

Perhaps the starting cell is always in the SE direction or something.

For cell at distance k, the coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0, |x|+ |y| + |z| = 2k, and the cell is determined by the values.

For a given k, the cells are all integer solutions to x+y+z=0, |x|+ |y| + |z| = 2k.

For k=2, 2k=4, x+y+z=0, |x|+|y|+|z|=4.

Possible: (2,-2,0), (2,0,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,1,-2), (1,-2,1), (1,-1,0) but distance 2, |1|+|-1|+0=2, but for k=2, distance 2, |x|+ |y| + |z| =2k=4.

So |x|+ |y| + |z| =4, x+y+z=0.

Let me list: assume x,y,z integers, sum 0, sum of abs 4.

Possible combinations:

- One coordinate 2, another -2, another 0: (2,-2,0), (2,0,-2), (-2,2,0), etc, all permutations: there are 3 choices for which is 2, 2 choices for which is -2, but since the zero is determined, so 3*2=6 cells: (2,-2,0), (2,0,-2), (0,2,-2), (-2,2,0), (-2,0,2), (0,-2,2)

- Or one coordinate 4, others -0, but 4+0+0=4, but sum 4≠0.

- Or 3,1,-4: sum 0, abs sum 3+1+4=8>4.

- Or 2,1,-3: sum 0, abs 2+1+3=6>4.

- Or 1,1,-2: sum 0, abs 1+1+2=4, good.

So (1,1,-2), (1,-2,1), (-2,1,1), (1,-2,1) is same as (-2,1,1)? No.

(1,1,-2), (1,-2,1), (-2,1,1), and also (-1,-1,2), (-1,2,-1), (2,-1,-1) — let's see.

The type (a,b,c) with a+b+c=0, |a|+|b|+|c|=4, and not all even or something, but here we have two types.

First type: two coordinates magnitude 2, one 0, like (2,-2,0) etc. There are 6 such cells, as listed.

Second type: one coordinate magnitude 2, others magnitude 1, but sum 0, so for example (2, -1, -1), since 2-1-1=0, abs 2+1+1=4.

Similarly, (2,-1,-1), (2,1,-3) no, (2,-1,-1) is one.

Also (-2,1,1), ( -2,-1,3) no.

So cells like (2,-1,-1), (2,1,-3)? 2+1-3=0, abs 2+1+3=6>4.

For (2,-1,-1): sum 2-1-1=0, abs 2+1+1=4, good.

Similarly, (-2,1,1), (-2,-1,-1)? -2-1-1= -4≠0.

So: (2,-1,-1), (2,1,-3)? no.

From a+b+c=0, a+ b + c =0, |a|+ |b| + |c| =4.

Assume a≥b≥c, then a≥0, c≤0, b can be positive or negative.

 a + b + c =0, a - b - c =4 if b,c<0, but better to solve.

From a+b+c=0, c= -a-b, then |a| + |b| + | -a-b| =4.

Case 1: a≥0, b≥0, then c= -a-b≤0, so |a|+ |b| + |c| = a + b + (a+b) =2a+2b=4, so a+b=2, and c= -2.

Then cells (a,b,-a-b) with a+b=2, a≥0,b≥0, so (2,0,-2), (1,1,-2), (0,2,-2)

But (2,0,-2), (0,2,-2) are already in the first type? (2,0,-2) is in the first list.

(1,1,-2) is new.

Case 2: a≥0, b<0, c= -a-b, since a≥0, b<0, c could be anything.

| a| + |b| + | -a-b| = a - b + | -a-b| 

Since b<0, |b| = -b.

| -a-b| = |-(a+b)| = |a+b|.

If a+b ≥0, then a - b + a+b =2a =4, so a=2, then c= -2-b, and a+b=2+b≥0, so b≥-2.

Also b<0, so b= -1 or -2.

If b= -1, c= -2-(-1) = -1, so (2,-1,-1)

If b= -2, c= -2-(-2) =0, so (2,-2,0) again.

If a+b<0, then |a+b| = -a-b, so a - b + (-a-b) = -2b =4, so b= -2, then a+b<0, a<2, and a≥0, c= -a-(-2) = -a+2.

Then |a| + |b| + |c| = a +2 + | -a+2| 

If a≤2, | -a+2| =2-a if a≤2, so a +2 +2-a =4, good.

So for b= -2, a<2, a≥0, c=2-a.

So a=0, c=2, cell (0,-2,2)

a=1, c=1, cell (1,-2,1)

a=2, c=0, cell (2,-2,0) but a<2, so a=0 or 1: (0,-2,2), (1,-2,1)

Other cases by symmetry.

So all cells for distance 2:

From above:

- (2,-2,0), (2,0,-2), (0,2,-2), (-2,2,0), (-2,0,2), (0,-2,2) — this is the first type, 6 cells.

- (1,1,-2), (1,-2,1), (-2,1,1), (-1,-1,2), (-1,2,-1), (2,-1,-1) — second type, 6 cells.

But 6+6=12, good for ring 2.

Now in our spiral, cell 8 is at (1,-2,1), which is in the second type.

Cell 9 is next, at (2,-2,0) or (0,-2,2) or (1,-1,0) but occupied, etc.

From earlier path, it went to (2,-2,0), which is in first type.

So both are present.

For cell 2026 in ring 26, we need its coordinates, then its six neighbors, then their numbers, then sum.

So first, find the offset m in the ring.

n=2026, ring k=26, a_k = first number of ring 26 = 3*26*25 +2 = 3*650 +2 = 1950+2=1952

So m = n - a_k +1 = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 75

So m=75 in the ring, which has 6*26=156 cells, so m=75.

Now, the ring is divided into 6 sectors, each with k=26 cells.

The sectors correspond to the six directions.

The first sector is for the NE direction or something.

Typically, the sectors are in counterclockwise order: say E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE, or based on the start.

From the start of the ring, which is at S_k = (k, -k, 0) ? But for k=26, (26,-26,0), but earlier for k=2, we have S_2 at (1,-2,1), not (2,-2,0).

However, in the spiral, the start cell is always the same relative position.

For ring k, the start cell S_k is at (k, -k, 0) for k odd? k=1: (1,-1,0) good, k=2: (2,-2,0), but we have (1,-2,1), which is different.

Notice that for k=1, S_1 = (1,-1,0)

For k=2, S_2 = (1,-2,1)

For k=3, it should be at (1,-3,2) or something? Let's see.

At the end of ring 2, what is the last cell.

From earlier, for ring 2, starts at 8 at (1,-2,1)

Then moves: in ring 1, it moved NW, W, etc., but for ring 2, it should move in similar relative directions.

From S_k, it has just arrived by moving E, so it turns counterclockwise to NE, but in absolute, for k=2, from (1,-2,1), move NE to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 9

Then turn to next direction, which is NW, move to (2,-2,0) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-1,-1) cell 10

Then turn to W, move to (2,-1,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (1,0,-2) cell 11

Then turn to SW, move to (1,0,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (0,0,-1) but distance 1, occupied by cell 3? (0,0,-1) sum -1≠0, mistake.

(1,0,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (0,0,-1), sum -1, not 0, error.

SW direction is (-1,0,1), so (1,0,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (0,0,-1), but x+y+z=0+0-1= -1 ≠0, so not a valid hex cell. Directions must be one of the six vectors that preserve sum 0.

The six vectors are: (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1), all sum to 0.

From (1,0,-2), adding (-1,0,1) = (0,0,-1), sum -1, not 0, so not valid. So cannot add that vector from there.

From (2,-1,-1), after cell 10, turn to W, move to (2,-1,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (1,0,-1) but that's cell 3, occupied.

So must be a different path.

For ring 2, after 10 at (2,-1,-1), it should move to a new cell, say (2,0,-2) by adding (0,1,-1) again, but that would be NW again, but it should turn.

Perhaps after placing the cell, it turns at the corner.

For ring k, the corners are at m = 1, k+1, 2k+1, 3k+1, 4k+1, 5k+1.

For k=2, corners at m=1,3,5,7,9,11.

Cell 8: m=1

Cell 9: m=2

Cell 10: m=3 (corner)

Cell 11: m=4

Cell 12: m=5 (corner)

etc.

At corner cells, it turns.

From S_k m=1, it is a corner, so it moves in the first direction for k-1 steps to the next corner, but for k=2, k-1=1, so one step to m=2, then at m=2, it is not a corner, so continues in the same direction to m=3, which is corner, then turns, and so on.

For k=2, from m=1: cell 8 at (1,-2,1)

Move in first direction, say NE, to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 9 m=2

Then since not corner (for k>1, corners are at multiples of k, but here m=2 is not corner yet), so continue in same direction to (2,-2,0) + (1,0,-1) = (3,-2,-1) cell 10 m=3

Now m=3 is a corner (since 3=2*1 +1? for k=2, corners at 1,3,5,7,9,11)

So at cell 10, turn to next direction, say NW, move to (3,-2,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (3,-1,-2) cell 11 m=4

Then continue to (3,-1,-2) + (0,1,-1) = (3,0,-3) cell 12 m=5 (corner)

Turn to next direction, say W, move to (3,0,-3) + (-1,1,0) = (2,1,-3) cell 13 m=6

Then to (2,1,-3) + (-1,1,0) = (1,2,-3) cell 14 m=7 (corner)

Turn to SW, move to (1,2,-3) + (-1,0,1) = (0,2,-2) cell 15 m=8

Then to (0,2,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (-1,2,-1) cell 16 m=9 (corner)

Turn to SE, move to (-1,2,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (-1,1,0) cell 17 m=10

Then to (-1,1,0) + (0,-1,1) = (-1,0,1) cell 18 m=11 (corner)

Turn to E, move to (-1,0,1) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-1,1) cell 19 m=12

But (0,-1,1) is cell 7, occupied, and distance 1, not in ring 2.

Mistake.

At m=11, cell 18 at (-1,0,1), which is cell 6 of ring 1, occupied.

So error.

Perhaps the directions are different.

For the last move, it should be to a new cell.

After cell 18 at (-1,0,1), move E to (0,-1,1), but that's cell 7, occupied.

So must be a different sequence.

Perhaps the first direction is not NE.

Let's look back at the diagram for ring 2.

In the snippet, we have cells: in top row: 14,4,3,10 — 4 and 3 are ring 1, so 14 and 10 are ring 2.

14 is left, 10 is right.

In center row: 15,5,1,2,9 — 5,1,2 ring 1, 15 and 9 ring 2.

Below: 16,6,7,8 — 6,7 ring 1, 16 and 8 ring 2.

So cell 8 is at bottom-right, cell 9 is at right of 2, cell 10 at right of 3, etc.

So likely, cell 8 at (1,-2,1) or equivalent.

Cell 9 at (2,-2,0) or (1,-1,0) but occupied, so (2,-2,0)

Cell 10 at (2,-1,-1) or (3,-2,-1)

But in diagram, 10 is above 3, and 3 is at (1,0,-1), so if 10 is at (2,-1,-1), then from (1,0,-1) to (2,-1,-1): difference (1,-1,0), which is E, so if 3 is at top, 10 is east of it.

Then cell 11 might be east of 10, at (3,-1,-2) or something.

Then cell 12 north of that, etc.

But to avoid occupation, it should be fine as long as not on previous rings.

For cell 10 at (2,-1,-1), then cell 11 at (3,-1,-2) by adding (1,0,-1) again, but then it should turn.

Perhaps after cell 10, it turns north.

Assume that for ring k, the first side is in the E direction for k cells, but for k=2, from S_k (1,-2,1), move E to (1,-2,1) + (1,-1,0) = (2,-3,1) cell 9

Then move E again to (3,-4,1) cell 10, but then not adjacent to existing.

Then from there turn, etc.

But in diagram, 9 is adjacent to 2, which is at (1,-1,0), so if 9 at (2,-3,1), distance to (1,-1,0) is |2-1| + |-3+1| + |1-0| =1+2+1=4, distance 2, not adjacent, but should be adjacent if in the same ring or to inner ring.

Cell 9 should be adjacent to cell 2, which is in ring 1, so distance should be 1, but 2 is at distance 1, 9 at distance 2, so | (2,-3,1) - (1,-1,0) | = (1,-2,1), sum 1-2+1=0, and |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, distance 2, not 1, so not adjacent. But in the grid, it should be adjacent, so my coordinate for S_k is wrong.

Perhaps S_k is at (k-1, -k, 1) or something.

For k=2, S_2 = (1,-2,1)

Cell 2 is at (1,-1,0)

Vector between: (1,-2,1) - (1,-1,0) = (0,-1,1), which is SE direction, so they are adjacent, good.

Cell 9 should be adjacent to cell 2, so if cell 9 is at (2,-2,0), then (2,-2,0) - (1,-1,0) = (1,-1,0), which is E, so adjacent, good.

Cell 10 at (2,-1,-1), adjacent to cell 3 at (1,0,-1): (2,-1,-1) - (1,0,-1) = (1,-1,0), E, good.

Cell 11 at say (1,0,-1) but occupied, or (2,0,-2), then (2,0,-2) - (2,-1,-1) = (0,1,-1), NW, good, and to cell 3: (2,0,-2) - (1,0,-1) = (1,0,-1), NE, good.

So assume cell 10 at (2,-1,-1), cell 11 at (2,0,-2), cell 12 at (1,0,-2) or (3,0,-3), but (1,0,-2) - (2,0,-2) = (-1,0,0), not a direction, so probably (3,0,-3) or (2,1,-3).

Let's continue the path.

From cell 10 at (2,-1,-1) , at corner, turn to NW, move to (2,-1,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (2,0,-2) cell 11

Then since k>1, continue in same direction to (2,0,-2) + (0,1,-1) = (2,1,-3) cell 12

Then at m=5, corner? For k=2, corners at m=1,3,5,7,9,11, so m=5 is corner, cell 12 at (2,1,-3)

Turn to W, move to (2,1,-3) + (-1,1,0) = (1,2,-3) cell 13

Then to (1,2,-3) + (-1,1,0) = (0,3,-3) cell 14

Then at m=7, corner, turn to SW, move to (0,3,-3) + (-1,0,1) = (-1,3,-2) cell 15

Then to (-1,3,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (-2,3,-1) cell 16

Then at m=9, corner, turn to SE, move to (-2,3,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (-2,2,0) cell 17

Then to (-2,2,0) + (0,-1,1) = (-2,1,1) cell 18

Then at m=11, corner, turn to E, move to (-2,1,1) + (1,-1,0) = (-1,0,1) cell 19

But (-1,0,1) is cell 6, occupied. Same problem.

To avoid this, perhaps the last move is not to that cell.

For the last sector, it moves in SE for k steps, but then to start next ring, it moves E from there, but for the last cell, it should be at a cell that is not occupied.

In this case, for ring 2, cell 19 should be at a new cell, say (0,-2,2) or something.

Perhaps the turn at the last corner is different, or the direction order is different.

Perhaps for the last side, it moves in E direction, but only for k-1 steps or something.

Let's calculate what cell 19 should be.

In the grid, cell 19 should be adjacent to cell 18 and to cell 7, and to cell 20, etc.

Cell 7 is at (0,-1,1), cell 18 at say (-2,1,1), distance | -2-0| + |1+1| + |1-1| =2+2+0=4, distance 2, not adjacent, so not good.

Perhaps the coordinate for S_k is different.

Another idea: perhaps the start cell for ring k is at (0, -k, k) or something.

For k=1: (0,-1,1) which is cell 7, not cell 2.

For k=2: (0,-2,2)

Then cell 8 at (0,-2,2)

Then move to cell 9: if move E to (1,-3,2) , etc.

But cell 8 should be adjacent to cell 7 at (0,-1,1), vector (0,-2,2) - (0,-1,1) = (0,-1,1), SE, so adjacent.

Cell 9 should be adjacent to cell 2 at (1,-1,0), so if cell 9 at (1,-3,2), distance to (1,-1,0) |0| + | -3+1| + |2-0| =0+2+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent, but should be, so not good.

Perhaps cell 9 at (1,-2,1), but then from (0,-2,2) to (1,-2,1): difference (1,0,-1), NE, so if it moves NE from 8 to 9, then to 10 at (2,-2,0), etc.

Then cell 9 at (1,-2,1) , cell 2 at (1,-1,0), vector (0,-1,1), SE, so adjacent, good.

Cell 10 at (2,-2,0), adjacent to cell 2: (2,-2,0) - (1,-1,0) = (1,-1,0), E, good.

Cell 11 at (2,-1,-1), etc.

Then for cell 19, if we continue, at m=12, after cell 18 at say (-1,0,1), but that's cell 6, occupied, so must end elsewhere.

Perhaps for the last cell, it is at (0,-2,2) or something.

Let's assume the path for ring 2:

Start at S_2 = (0,-2,2) cell 8

Then move NE to (0,-2,2) + (1,0,-1) = (1,-2,1) cell 9

Then move NE again to (1,-2,1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 10 (m=3, corner)

Turn to NW, move to (2,-2,0) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-1,-1) cell 11

Then to (2,-1,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (2,0,-2) cell 12 (m=5, corner)

Turn to W, move to (2,0,-2) + (-1,1,0) = (1,1,-2) cell 13

Then to (1,1,-2) + (-1,1,0) = (0,2,-2) cell 14 (m=7, corner)

Turn to SW, move to (0,2,-2) + (-1,0,1) = (-1,2,-1) cell 15

Then to (-1,2,-1) + (-1,0,1) = (-2,2,0) cell 16 (m=9, corner)

Turn to SE, move to (-2,2,0) + (0,-1,1) = (-2,1,1) cell 17

Then to (-2,1,1) + (0,-1,1) = (-2,0,2) cell 18 (m=11, corner)

Turn to E, move to (-2,0,2) + (1,-1,0) = (-1,-1,2) cell 19

Then (-1,-1,2) is new, distance | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, good, and sum -1-1+2=0, good.

And it is not occupied, since previous cells are at distance 1 or 2, but not this one.

So cell 19 at (-1,-1,2)

Then for next ring, it would move E from here to (-1,-1,2) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-2,2) but that's cell 8, occupied, so should be to (0,-2,2) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-3,2) for cell 20, etc.

But (0,-2,2) is cell 8, so from cell 19 at (-1,-1,2), move E to (0,-2,2), which is cell 8, but cell 8 is already placed, so cannot.

The move to start ring 3 is from the end of ring 2, which is cell 19 at (-1,-1,2), move E to a new cell for ring 3 start.

E is (1,-1,0), so (-1,-1,2) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-2,2), but (0,-2,2) is cell 8, which is in ring 2, already occupied, so not good.

So still problem.

Perhaps the direction for the last move is different, or the start of next ring is in a different direction.

For ring 3, it should start at a cell east of the end of ring 2.

End of ring 2 is cell 19 at (-1,-1,2)

East of it is (-1,-1,2) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-2,2), which is cell 8, occupied.

Southeast: (0,-1,1) cell 7, occupied.

Northeast: (0,-1,1) again or ( -1,-1,2) + (1,0,-1) = (0,-1,1) cell 7.

All neighbors are at distance 1 or 2, but (0,-2,2) is distance |0|+|-2|+|2|=4, distance 2, but occupied by cell 8.

So no new cell adjacent in E direction.

Perhaps it moves in a different direction to start the next ring.

In some spirals, it moves to the cell that is "south" or something.

For example, from cell 19 at (-1,-1,2), move SE to ( -1,-1,2) + (0,-1,1) = (-1,-2,3) for cell 20.

Then etc.

So S_3 = (-1,-2,3)

Then for ring 3, and so on.

This is getting messy, and for k=26, it will be complicated.

Perhaps there is a formula for the coordinates based on the number.

I recall that in hexagonal grid spirals, the position can be found by solving for the ring and then the sector.

For a number n, ring k as above.

Then the offset m = n - a_k + 1, 1≤m≤6k.

Then the " side" s = floor((m-1)/k) , 0≤s≤5, indicating which side of the hexagon.

Then within the side, the position t = (m-1) mod k, 0≤t≤k-1, the index along the side.

Then the cell's coordinates can be determined based on s and t.

For example, for s=0, the first side, cells are in the E direction or something.

From the start cell S_k, which is at a specific position.

For example, for s=0, cells are at S_k + t * D0, for some direction D0.

But S_k depends on k.

From the end of previous ring, S_k = end_{k-1} + E

And end_{k-1} is the last cell of ring k-1.

For ring k-1, last cell is at a certain position.

For example, for ring 1, last cell 7 at (0,-1,1)

Then S_2 = 7 + E = (0,-1,1) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-2,1)

For ring 2, last cell 19 at, from above, if we set it to (-1,-1,2), then S_3 = 19 + E = (-1,-1,2) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-2,2)

But (0,-2,2) is cell 8, occupied, so conflict.

Unless for ring 2, last cell is not (-1,-1,2), but something else.

In our earlier calculation for ring 2, if we go to cell 19 at (-1,-1,2), but then S_3 would be at (0,-2,2), which is cell 8, so perhaps cell 8 is not in ring 2, but it is.

Perhaps the move to start next ring is not E, but another direction.

In some implementations, it turns left or right.

Perhaps for this spiral, after placing the last cell, it moves in the SE direction to start the next ring.

For example, from end of ring 1: 7 at (0,-1,1), move SE to (0,-1,1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,-2,2) for cell 8.

Then for ring 2, start at (0,-2,2)

Then from there, it can move NE to (1,-2,1) for cell 9, etc.

Then S_3 = end of ring 2 + SE.

If end of ring 2 is cell 19 at say (-1,-1,2), move SE to (-1,-1,2) + (0,-1,1) = (-1,-2,3) for cell 20.

Then good.

So let's assume that.

General rule: the start of ring k is obtained by moving SE from the end of ring k-1.

For ring 0: cell 1 at (0,0,0)

End of ring 0 is 1.

Then S_1 = 1 + SE = (0,0,0) + (0,-1,1) = (0,-1,1) cell 2? But in our case, cell 2 is at (1,-1,0), not (0,-1,1).

(0,-1,1) is cell 7.

So not.

Move E from end of ring 0: 1 + E = (1,-1,0) cell 2, good.

Then end of ring 1 is cell 7 at (0,-1,1)

Then S_2 = 7 + ? If E, to (1,-2,1) cell 8, good.

Then end of ring 2 should be at, say, (-1,-1,2) or something, then S_3 = end2 + E = (-1,-1,2) + (1,-1,0) = (0,-2,2) cell 8, occupied, not good.

So perhaps S_k = end_{k-1} + SE

For k=2: end1 = (0,-1,1) + SE = (0,-1,1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,-2,2) cell 8

Then for ring 2, start at (0,-2,2)

Then cells: from here, it can move NE to (0,-2,2) + (1,0,-1) = (1,-2,1) cell 9

Then NE to (2,-2,0) cell 10

Then at corner, turn to NW, etc., as before.

Then end of ring 2 at cell 19 at (-1,-1,2) as before.

Then S_3 = end2 + SE = (-1,-1,2) + (0,-1,1) = (-1,-2,3) cell 20

Good.

And for ring 1, S_1 = end0 + E = (0,0,0) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-1,0) cell 2, good.

End of ring 1 is cell 7 at (0,-1,1), as before.

So this works for the start.

Now for the path within the ring.

For ring k, start at S_k.

Then it moves in a sequence of directions for k steps each, with turns.

From the arrival, it has just moved SE to arrive at S_k for k>1, or E for k=1.

For k=1, it arrived by E, so at S_1, it turns counterclockwise to NE, then to NW, etc., as before.

For k>1, it arrived by SE, so at S_k, it turns counterclockwise from SE.

From SE, counterclockwise might be to E or to S, but in hex, the directions are discrete.

The six directions in order, say clockwise or counterclockwise.

Assume the directions are ordered counterclockwise: E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE.

So from a given direction, counterclockwise turn means next in this list.

From SE, counterclockwise would be to E? Since SE, then E is next if it's a cycle, but typically it's a cycle: after SE comes E.

In the list E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE, so after SE should be E, but that might not be correct.

From the arrival direction: it arrived by moving SE to S_k.

So the approach direction is SE.

Then it turns counterclockwise, so from SE, counterclockwise is to E.

So it moves in the E direction for k steps.

For example, for k=2, S_2 = (0,-2,2)

Then move E to (0,-2,2) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-3,2) cell 9

Then move E again to (2,-4,2) cell 10

Then at this cell, it is a corner? For k=2, corners at every k steps, so after k steps, at m=k, it is a corner.

After placing cell 10 at m=3? Let's see.

Cells placed: S_k is cell for m=1.

Then after first move, cell m=2 at (1,-3,2)

After second move, cell m=3 at (2,-4,2)

Since k=2, after k steps in the first direction, at m=k=2? No, after placing the k-th cell in the direction, but since it starts at m=1, after placing m=1, then it places m=2, m=3 in the first direction, but for k=2, it should place 2 cells in the first direction, so cells m=1 and m=2 in first direction? But S_k is already placed, so it places k-1 additional cells in the first direction to reach the next corner.

Standard way: for a side, it places k cells, from corner to corner.

So for the first side, from S_k (corner) to the next corner, it places k cells, including both corners.

So for k=2, it places 2 cells: m=1 and m=2 in the first direction.

So from S_k, it moves in the first direction to place the next cell, and after k-1 moves, it has placed k cells, reaching the next corner.

For k=2, from S_k (0,-2,2), move in first direction E to (0,-2,2) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-3,2) cell m=2

Then at this cell, it is the next corner, so turn to the next direction.

For k=2, after placing m=2, at cell 9, turn to next direction.

From arrival by SE, turned to E, now at corner, turn counterclockwise to NE.

So move NE to (1,-3,2) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-3,1) cell m=3

Then since k>1, it must place k cells in this direction, so another cell, move again NE to (3,-3,0) cell m=4

Then at this cell, it is corner (since after k steps in this side), so turn to next direction NW, and so on.

Then for the last cell, it should be fine.

For n=2026, k=26, m=75.

First, find the start cell S_k for ring k.

S_k is obtained by from the end of ring k-1, move in SE direction.

End of ring k-1 is the last cell of ring k-1, which is number b_{k-1} = 1 + 3(k-1)k

For k=26, ring k-1=25, b_25 = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1+1950=1951

So end of ring 25 is cell 1951 at some position.

S_26 = cell 1951 + SE vector = cell 1951 + (0,-1,1)

Similarly, cell 1951 = end of ring 25 = S_25 + the path in ring 25.

But to find cell 1951's position, we need its coordinates, which depends on its ring and offset.

This is recursive, but perhaps we can find a closed form for S_k.

Let P_k be the position of S_k, the start of ring k.

Then P_k = end_{k-1} + SE

 end_{k-1} = the last cell of ring k-1, which is the cell at offset m=6*(k-1) in ring k-1, since there are 6(k-1) cells, last is m=6(k-1)

For ring j, number of cells 6j, so last cell has offset m=6j.

For ring j, a_j = 3j(j-1) +2, so last cell b_j = a_j + 6j -1 = 3j(j-1) +2 +6j -1 = 3j^2 -3j +2 +6j -1 = 3j^2 +3j +1, as before.

The position of the last cell of ring j is at a corner, and based on the path, it is at a specific position.

From the path, after placing the last cell of ring j, it is at a cell that is in the SE direction or something.

For example, for j=1, end cell 7 at (0,-1,1)

For j=2, if we have cell 19 at (-1,-1,2)

For j=3, end cell b_3=37, at say (-2,-2,4) or something.

Notice that for j=1, (0,-1,1) = (0,-1,1)

j=2, (-1,-1,2)

j=3, suppose (-2,-2,4) or (-1,-2,3)

Assume that end_j = (-j, -j, 2j) / or something.

For j=1: (-1,-1,2) but we have (0,-1,1), not matching.

(0,-1,1) = - (0,1,-1) not.

Perhaps end_j = (0, -j, j)

For j=1: (0,-1,1) good.

j=2: (0,-2,2) but earlier we had (-1,-1,2), not the same.

In our path for ring 2, if we start at (0,-2,2), and end at (-1,-1,2), which is not (0,-2,2).

So not.

Perhaps end_j = (- (j-1), -j, j+ (j-1) ) or something.

For j=1: (-0, -1, 1+0) = (0,-1,1) good.

For j=2: (-1, -2, 2+1) = (-1,-2,3)

But in our earlier, we had (-1,-1,2), not this.

So not.

Perhaps it's ( - floor((j-1)/2), -j, j + floor((j-1)/2) ) or something, but complicated.

Notice that in the SE direction, but the sum x+y+z=0, and for end_j, it might be on the SE ray.

For example, end1 at (0,-1,1) = 0* (1,0,-1) + 1* (0,-1,1) or something.

The vector SE is (0,-1,1), so cells on the SE ray from center are t* (0,-1,1) for t>0, but (0,-t,t), sum 0, distance |0|+|-t|+|t| =2t, so for distance d, t=d, so (0,-d,d)

For d=1, (0,-1,1) cell 7, good.

For d=2, (0,-2,2) cell, but in ring 2, this is cell 8, not the end.

End is cell 19, at distance 2, but not on this ray.

So not.

Perhaps for each ring, the end cell is at a different position.

From the move, S_k = end_{k-1} + SE

 end_{k-1} = last cell of ring k-1

 S_k = first cell of ring k

For k=1: S_1 = end_0 + E = (0,0,0) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-1,0) cell 2

 end_0 = cell 1 = (0,0,0)

For k=2: S_2 = end_1 + SE = (0,-1,1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,-2,2) cell 8

 end_1 = cell 7 = (0,-1,1)

For k=3: S_3 = end_2 + SE

 end_2 = last cell of ring 2, which is cell 19.

From earlier, if we have the path, for ring 2, start at (0,-2,2) cell 8 m=1

Then move E to (0,-2,2) + (1,-1,0) = (1,-3,2) cell 9 m=2

Then since k=2, after placing m=2, at corner, turn to NE, move to (1,-3,2) + (1,0,-1) = (2,-3,1) cell 10 m=3

Then turn to NW (since counterclockwise from NE is NW), move to (2,-3,1) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 11 m=4

Then turn to W, move to (2,-2,0) + (-1,1,0) = (1,-1,0) but cell 2, occupied, so error.

From (2,-3,1) move NW to (2,-2,0), then from there, if move W to (1,-1,0) occupied, so must move in NW again or other.

Perhaps after turn, it moves in the new direction.

From cell 10 at (2,-3,1), turn to NW, move to (2,-3,1) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-2,0) cell 11

Then at this cell, since k>1, and it is not yet the end of the side, but for this side, it should place k=2 cells in NW direction, so far only one cell (m=3), so it needs to place another cell in the same direction.

So move again NW to (2,-2,0) + (0,1,-1) = (2,-1,-1) cell 12 m=5

Then at this cell, it is corner (since after k steps in this side), so turn to next direction W, move to (2,-1,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (1,0,-1) but cell 3, occupied.

Same problem.

To resolve this, perhaps for the directions, when it turns, it moves in the new direction for k steps, but the corner cell is shared, so it places k cells per side, but the corner is the start of the next side.

In standard treatment, for a side, it places k cells, from the corner, but the corner is not included in the side; the side has k cells between corners.

For ring k, there are 6 corners, and between corners, there are k cells along the side, but the corners are shared, so total cells 6k, with 6 corners.

For example, ring 1: 6 corners: cells 2,3,4,5,6,7, each is a corner since k=1.

For ring 2, 6 corners, and between them, 2 cells per side, but since corners are shared, total cells 6*2 =12, so each "side" has 2 cells, including the corners or not.

If a side has 2 cells, and there are 6 sides, but each corner cell is shared by two sides, so total cells = (6 * 2) / 2 = 6, not 12, so not.

For a polygon, with s sides, each side has c cells, then total cells = s * c, since cells are on the sides, not at corners.

In this case, for a hexagonal ring, there are 6 sides, each with k cells, so total 6k cells, and the cells are along the sides, and the corners are the cells at the turns.

For example, for k=2, each side has 2 cells, so for example, side 1: cells 8,9

 side 2: cells 10,11

 side 3: cells 12,13

 side 4: cells 14,15

 side 5: cells 16,17

 side 6: cells 18,19

 and the corners are between sides, so cell 8 is corner between side 6 and side 1, cell 9 is end of side 1 and start of side 2, etc.

In general, the corners are at m = 1, k+1, 2k+1, 3k+1, 4k+1, 5k+1

For k=2, corners at m=1,3,5,7,9,11

So cells at these offsets are corners.

For a cell at offset m in ring k, it is a corner if (m-1) mod k == 0, i.e., m ≡ 1 mod k.

Otherwise, it is on a side.

The side number s = floor((m-1)/k) , 0≤s≤5

Then within the side, the index t = (m-1) mod k, 0≤t<k

For each side s, the cells are placed in a specific direction.

The directions for each s can be determined.

For s=0, the first side, cells are placed in the E direction.

For s=1, NE direction.

s=2, NW direction.

s=3, W direction.

s=4, SW direction.

s=5, SE direction.

Or something like that.

Then the starting point for each side is the corner cell at m = s*k +1

For s=0, m=1, S_k

For s=1, m=k+1, which is the next corner.

From the corner, it moves in the direction for that side for k steps, but since it starts at the corner, and moves to the next cells, for t=0 at the corner, then t=1,2, ..., k-1 along the side.

So for a given s and t, the cell is at P_s + t * D_s, where P_s is the position of the corner cell for that side.

P_s depends on s and k.

P_s for s=0 is S_k

For s=1 is the cell at m=k+1, which is S_k + k * D0, if D0 is the direction for s=0.

For example, for k=2, s=0, P_0 = S_2 = (0,-2,2) say

D0 = E = (1,-1,0)

Then for t=0: cell m=1 at (0,-2,2)

 t=1: cell m=2 at (0,-2,2) + 1* (1,-1,0) = (1,-3,2)

Then for s=1, P_1 = cell at m=k+1=3, which is the end of side 0, so P_0 + k * D0 = (0,-2,2) + 2* (1,-1,0) = (2,-4,2)

D1 = NE = (1,0,-1)

Then for t=0: cell m=3 at (2,-4,2)

 t=1: cell m=4 at (2,-4,2) + 1* (1,0,-1) = (3,-4,1)

Then for s=2, P_2 = cell at m=2k+1=5, which is P_1 + k * D1 = (2,-4,2) + 2* (1,0,-1) = (4,-4,0)

D2 = NW = (0,1,-1)

 t=0: cell m=5 at (4,-4,0)

 t=1: cell m=6 at (4,-4,0) + (0,1,-1) = (4,-3,-1)

And so on.

Then for cell 2026, k=26, m=75.

s = floor((m-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) = 2

t = (m-1) mod k = 74 mod 26 = 74 - 2*26 = 74-52=22

So s=2, t=22

Now for s=2, direction D_s = NW = (0,1,-1)

But we need P_s, the corner cell for s=2, which is at m = s*k +1 = 2*26 +1 = 53

So cell at m=53 is the start of side s=2.

This cell is at position P_2 for ring k=26.

P_2 = P_0 + s * k * D0 + something, but P_0 = S_k, and for each side, P_s = P_{s-1} + k * D_{s-1}

With P_0 = S_k

D_s for s=0: E = (1,-1,0)

s=1: NE = (1,0,-1)

s=2: NW = (0,1,-1)

s=3: W = (-1,1,0)

s=4: SW = (-1,0,1)

s=5: SE = (0,-1,1)

Then P_s = P_{s-1} + k * D_{s-1}

For example, for s=1, P_1 = P_0 + k * D0

s=2, P_2 = P_1 + k * D1

s=3, P_3 = P_2 + k * D2

etc.

P_0 = S_k

S_k = end_{k-1} + SE = last cell of ring k-1 + (0,-1,1)

 last cell of ring k-1 is at offset m=6*(k-1) in ring k-1.

For ring j, the last cell (m=6j) is at a corner, and for s=5, since it is the last side.

For example, for ring 1, last cell m=6, s = floor((6-1)/1) = floor(5/1)=5, t=0, so s=5, t=0, corner.

D_s for s=5: SE = (0,-1,1)

P_s for s=5 in ring 1: cell 7 at (0,-1,1)

Which is P_5 = S_1 + 5 * k * D0 or something, but for ring 1, k=1, P_0 = S_1 = (1,-1,0)

P_5 = P_0 + sum_{i=0}^{4} k * D_i = (1,-1,0) + 1* [(1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) + (0,1,-1) + (-1,1,0) + (-1,0,1)] = (1,-1,0) + (1-1+0-1-1, -1+0+1+1+0, 0-1-1+0+1) = (1,-1,0) + (-2,1,-1) = (-1,0,-1) but should be (0,-1,1), not matching.

Perhaps P_s = P_0 + sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k * D_i

For s=5, P_5 = P_0 + k * (D0+D1+D2+D3+D4) = (1,-1,0) + 1* [(1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) + (0,1,-1) + (-1,1,0) + (-1,0,1)] = (1,-1,0) + (1+1+0-1-1, -1+0+1+1+0, 0-1-1+0+1) = (1,-1,0) + (0,1,-1) = (1,0,-1) but should be (0,-1,1), not matching.

Perhaps the directions are cumulative in a different way.

For the corner cell at s, it can be expressed as S_k + k * sum_{i=0}^{s-1} D_i

For s=0, P_0 = S_k + 0

s=1, P_1 = S_k + k * D0

s=2, P_2 = S_k + k * (D0 + D1)

s=3, P_3 = S_k + k * (D0 + D1 + D2)

s=4, P_4 = S_k + k * (D0+..+D3)

s=5, P_5 = S_k + k * (D0+..+D4)

Then for the last cell, s=5, t=k-1, but for s=5, t=0 is P_5, t=1 is P_5 + D5, etc.

For ring 1, k=1, S_k = (1,-1,0)

P_0 = S_k = (1,-1,0) cell 2

P_1 = S_k + k * D0 = (1,-1,0) + 1*(1,-1,0) = (2,-2,0) but should be cell 3 at (1,0,-1), not matching.

Perhaps S_k + k * sum_{i=0}^{s-1} D_i for the direction sum.

 sum_{i=0}^{4} D_i = D0+ D1+ D2+ D3+ D4 = (1,-1,0) + (1,0,-1) + (0,1,-1) + (-1,1,0) + (-1,0,1) = (1+1+0-1-1, -1+0+1+1+0, 0-1-1+0+1) = (0,1,-1)

Then P_5 = S_k + k * (0,1,-1) = (1,-1,0) + 1*(0,1,-1) = (1,0,-1) cell 3, but should be cell 7 at (0,-1,1), not matching.

So not.

Perhaps the directions are for the move, but the position is different.

For the cell at (s,t), it is at S_k + s * k * V + t * D_s or something.

This is taking too long, and for the sake of time, perhaps I can assume that for a given cell, its neighbors can be found without coordinates by noting that in the spiral, the neighbors are the cells at distance less or equal, but usually in the same or adjacent rings.

For a cell in ring k, its neighbors could be in ring k-1, k, or k+1.

For cell n=2026 in ring k=26, its six neighbors are likely in rings 25,26,27.

But since it's on the ring, some neighbors are in the same ring, some in inner, some in outer.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, which for a cell in ring k, since the ring is convex, typically two neighbors in ring k-1 (inner), two in ring k (same), and two in ring k+1 (outer), or something like that, but depends on if it's a corner or not.

For example, for cell 1 in ring 0, neighbors are all in ring 1.

For cell 2 in ring 1, neighbors: in the diagram, adjacent to 1 (ring 0), 3 (ring 1), and 8,9 (ring 2), and also to 7? Cell 2 at (1,-1,0), neighbors: (1+1,-1-1,0) = (2,-2,0), (1+1,-1+0,0-1) = (2,-1,-1), (1+0,-1+1,0-1) = (1,0,-1), (1-1,-1+1,0) = (0,0,0), (1-1,-1+0,0+1) = (0,-1,1), (1+0,-1-1,0+1) = (1,-2,1)

So cells at: (2,-2,0) may be ring 2, (2,-1,-1) ring 2, (1,0,-1) cell 3 ring 1, (0,0,0) cell 1 ring 0, (0,-1,1) cell 7 ring 1, (1,-2,1) cell 8 ring 2.

So neighbors: 1 ( ring 0), 3 and 7 ( ring 1), 8 and others ( ring 2).

Specifically, for cell 2, neighbors include one in ring 0, two in ring 1, and three in ring 2? But in hex, only six neighbors.

From above: (0,0,0) cell 1, (1,0,-1) cell 3, (0,-1,1) cell 7, and (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,1) which are in ring 2, so three in ring 2, one in ring 0, two in ring 1? 1,3,7, and three more.

But cell 7 is already listed, so neighbors are cell 1,3,7, and say cell 8,9,10 or something.

In the list, (1,-2,1) is cell 8, (2,-2,0) cell 9 or 10, etc.

So for a cell in ring k, it has neighbors in k-1, k, k+1.

For cell 2026 in ring 26, its neighbors will be in rings 25,26,27.

To find the sum, I need to identify which neighbors are in which ring and their numbers.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors can be related to the number itself by a formula, but unlikely.

Another idea: in such spirals, the number at a cell can be related to its coordinates, and then neighbors can be calculated.

For example, there are formulas for the number at (x,y,z) in hexagonal spiral.

But it might be complicated.

Perhaps for the cell at offset m in ring k, its neighbors' offsets can be determined based on if it's a corner or not.

For n=2026, k=26, m=75.

s = floor((m-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = 2, as before.

t = (m-1) mod k = 74 mod 26 = 22, as before.

Now, is it a corner? m=75, (75-1) mod 26 = 74 mod 26 = 22 ≠ 0, so not a corner (since for corner, t=0).

So it is on the side s=2, at index t=22.

For side s=2, which is the NW side, and it is not a corner, so it has neighbors along the side and perpendicular.

In general, for a cell on a side, not corner, it has two neighbors in the same ring: one in the same side (t-1 and t+1), and then neighbors in other directions.

Specifically for this position, since it's on the NW side, the neighbors in the same ring are the cells at t-1 and t+1 on the same side, so m-1 and m+1, if not at end.

m=75, s=2, t=22, so on side s=2, cells from m= s*k +1 = 2*26+1=53 to m= (s+1)*k = 3*26=78

So m from 53 to 78? s=2, cells m=53,54, ..., 78, but 78-53+1=26, good.

So cell at t=0: m=53

 t=1: m=54
 ...
 t=25: m=78

So for t=22, m=53 +22 = 75, yes.

So cells on this side: m=53 to 78.

So for cell m=75, it is at t=22, so not at end, so it has previous cell in side: m=74 (t=21), and next cell in side: m=76 (t=23).

Then other neighbors.

In the hexagonal grid, for a cell on the NW side, the neighbors are: along the side: NW and SE directions? Let's think.

In the grid, the side is in the NW direction, so along the side, the cells are connected by NW or something, but in the path, for s=2, D_s = NW = (0,1,-1), so the cells are at P_s + t * (0,1,-1), so the vector between consecutive cells is (0,1,-1), which is the NW direction.

So the neighbors along the side are at + (0,1,-1) and - (0,1,-1), i.e., m+1 and m-1 in the ring.

Then other neighbors: in the radial direction and tangential.

Specifically, for a cell on the side, it has neighbors in the inward and outward directions.

For example, in ring k, a cell on the side, it has a neighbor in ring k-1 in the inward radial direction, and a neighbor in ring k+1 in the outward radial direction, and then on the sides.

But in hex grid, each cell has six neighbors, so for a cell on the ring, not corner, it has: two neighbors in the same ring (along the side), two in ring k-1 ( inward), and two in ring k+1 ( outward), or something.

From the earlier example of cell 2 in ring 1: it has cell 3 and cell 7 in the same ring ( along the side or not), cell 1 in ring 0, and cells in ring 2.

In cell 2, it has cell 1 ( in), cell 3 ( same), cell 7 ( same), cell 8 ( out), and two more.

In the grid, it should have six.

From earlier calculation, neighbors at (0,0,0) cell 1, (1,0,-1) cell 3, (0,-1,1) cell 7, and (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,1) which are in ring 2, say cell 8,9,10.

So three in ring 2, one in ring 0, two in ring 1.

For a cell not on corner, in ring k, it may have different number.

For cell 3 in ring 1: at (1,0,-1)

Neighbors: (1+1,0-1,-1+0) = (2,-1,-1), (1+1,0+0,-1-1) = (2,0,-2), (1+0,0+1,-1-1) = (1,1,-2), (1-1,0+1,-1+0) = (0,1,-1), (1-1,0+0,-1+1) = (0,0,0), (1+0,0-1,-1+1) = (1,-1,0)

So cells: (2,-1,-1) ring 2, (2,0,-2) ring 2, (1,1,-2) ring 2, (0,1,-1) cell 4 ring 1, (0,0,0) cell 1 ring 0, (1,-1,0) cell 2 ring 1.

So again, one in ring 0, two in ring 1, three in ring 2.

For a corner cell, like cell 2 is corner, same as cell 3.

In ring 1, all cells are corners, so same.

For a cell in higher ring not corner, say in ring 2, cell 9 at (1,-3,2) or whatever, but from earlier.

Perhaps for any cell in ring k>0, it has exactly one neighbor in ring k-1, two in ring k, and three in ring k+1.

Then for cell 2026 in ring 26, it has one neighbor in ring 25, two in ring 26, three in ring 27.

Then to find the sum, I need to identify which cells they are.

The neighbor in ring k-1 is typically the cell radially inward.

For a cell at (x,y,z) in ring k, the inward radial neighbor might be at (x,y,z) - (x,y,z)/k or something, but not integer.

In terms of the offset, for a cell at offset m in ring k, the inward neighbor can be found by the position.

Perhaps the number of the inward neighbor is n - 6(k-1) or something, but not accurate.

For example, cell 2 in ring 1, inward neighbor is cell 1 in ring 0, number 1 = 2 -1.

Cell 3 in ring 1, inward neighbor cell 1, number 1 = 3-2.

Cell 8 in ring 2, inward neighbor might be cell 2 or cell 7.

In diagram, cell 8 is below-right, adjacent to cell 7 ( ring 1) and cell 2 ( ring 1)? Cell 2 is at east, cell 7 at southeast, so both in ring 1.

So for cell 8, it has two neighbors in ring 1: cell 2 and cell 7.

So not only one.

In this case, for cell 8, neighbors include cell 7 ( in), cell 2 ( in), cell 9 ( same), cell 16 or something ( out), etc.

So varies.

To solve the problem, perhaps for the number 2026, I can find its position and then neighbors.

Perhaps the sum is approximately 6*2026, but not exact.

Or perhaps there is a pattern or formula.

Another idea: in many spirals, the sum of neighbors might be constant or linear, but unlikely.

Perhaps for this specific number, since it's large, the sum is roughly 6 times the number, but we need exact.

Perhaps the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and then the cells at the turns.

But from the spiral, the neighbors are not necessarily consecutive numbers.

For example, for cell 1, neighbors 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

For cell 2, neighbors include 1,3,7,8,9,10 or something, sum 1+3+7+8+9+10=38.

For cell 3, 1,2,4,10,11,12, sum 1+2+4+10+11+12=40.

Different.

Perhaps for a cell in ring k, the sum of neighbors can be expressed in terms of k and m.

But it might be complicated.

Perhaps the grid is such that the number at (x,y) can be calculated, but in hex, coordinates are three-dimensional.

I recall that for the hexagonal coordinate system with axial coordinates, the number can be found by the ring and the angle.

Perhaps for cell at offset m in ring k, the six neighbors have offsets m-1, m+1 in the same ring, and then for the radial, the inward and outward.

But the radial neighbors may not be at fixed offset.

For example, for cell m in ring k, the inward neighbor might be at a specific position in ring k-1.

In particular, for a cell on the side, the inward neighbor is at the cell in ring k-1 that is in the same "direction".

For example, for cell 8 in ring 2, at (0,-2,2), if we take, and it is on the first cell, s=0, t=0, so corner.

Then its inward neighbors are the cells in ring 1 that are adjacent.

In the diagram, it is adjacent to cell 7 at (0,-1,1), which is directly "above" or radial in.

Cell 7 is at (0,-1,1), which is the SE neighbor of center, and cell 8 at (0,-2,2) = 2* (0,-1,1), so on the same ray.

So perhaps for a cell at distance k, on the ray in direction D, the inward neighbor is at distance k-1 on the same ray.

For cell 2026, if I can find which ray it is on, then inward neighbor is on the same ray in ring k-1.

Then outward on the same ray in ring k+1, and then the other neighbors.

For example, for cell 8 at (0,-2,2) = 2 * (0,-1,1), so in direction SE.

Inward neighbor at 1 * (0,-1,1) = (0,-1,1) cell 7.

Outward at 3 * (0,-1,1) = (0,-3,3) cell in ring 3.

Then the other neighbors are at the sides.

In this case, for cell 8, other neighbors: in the same ring, cell 9 at (1,-3,2), and cell 19 or something, and in other directions.

From earlier, it has cell 9, cell 16, etc.

For cell 2026, if I can find its direction from center, then inward neighbor is at the same direction at distance k-1.

Then the number at a cell at distance k in direction D can be found.

The cells at distance k on a particular ray are at the same "azimuth".

For a given direction, there is only one cell at each distance on that ray, for the pure directions.

For example, in direction E: cells at (k, -k, 0) for k=1,2,3,...

Number at (k,-k,0): for k=1: (1,-1,0) cell 2

k=2: (2,-2,0) cell in ring 2, which is cell 9 or 10, in our case for ring 2, (2,-2,0) is cell 11 or something.

In earlier path, cell 9 at (1,-3,2), cell 10 at (2,-3,1), not (2,-2,0).

So not on pure ray.

For cell 2026, with s=2, t=22 in ring 26, it is on the NW side.

The direction for the side is NW = (0,1,-1), so the cells on this side are at P_s + t * (0,1,-1)

P_s for s=2 is the corner at m=53 for this ring.

P_s = S_k + s * k * D0 + something, but we need S_k.

S_k = end_{k-1} + SE

 end_{k-1} for k=26, ring 25, last cell b_25=1951

 end_25 = the cell at distance 25 in some direction.

From the construction, end_k is at a cell that is in the SE direction or something.

For example, end1 at (0,-1,1) SE

 end2 at (-1,-1,2) or in our last assumption, for ring 2, if we have cell 19 at (-1,-1,2), which is not pure SE.

 (-1,-1,2) = - (1,1,-2) , not a pure direction.

Perhaps end_k = ( -k, 0, k) or something, but for k=1: (-1,0,1) cell 6, not 7.

So not.

Perhaps end_k = (0, -k, k) for k=1: (0,-1,1) good, for k=2: (0,-2,2) but in our path, it's at (-1,-1,2), not the same.

To resolve, for the sake of this problem, since the sum might be the same regardless, or perhaps for large k, it doesn't matter, but we need exact.

Perhaps the sum of the six neighbors can be calculated as 6n + c for some c, but from earlier examples, for n=1, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

6*1 +21 =27, c=21

n=2, sum say 1+3+7+8+9+10=38, 6*2+26=12+26=38, c=26

n=3, sum 1+2+4+10+11+12=40, 6*3+22=18+22=40, c=22

n=4, assume neighbors 3,5,11,12,13,14, sum 3+5+11+12+13+14=58, 6*4+34=24+34=58, c=34

c is not constant.

Perhaps c depends on the ring.

For n in ring k, c = 3k(k+1) or something.

For n=1, k=0, sum 27, 6*1 +21, k=0, 3*0*1=0 not 21.

Perhaps sum = 6n + 6k or something.

For n=1, k=0, 6*1 +6*0=6, not 27.

Another idea: in some grids, the sum of neighbors is 6n for n not on edge, but here it is on edge.

Perhaps for this spiral, the number at (x,y,z) can be given by a formula.

After a search in my memory, I recall that for the hexagonal spiral of natural numbers, the number at coordinates (i,j) in axial system can be calculated, but it's complex.

Perhaps for the cell at ring k, offset m, the number is b_{k-1} + m, since a_k = b_{k-1} +1, and numbers are consecutive in the ring, so number = a_k + m -1 = 1952 + 75 -1 = 2026, obviously.

To find its neighbors' numbers.

Perhaps the relative position determines the neighbors' offsets.

For example, for a cell on the side s, at index t, the neighbors in the same ring are at m-1 and m+1.

Then the inward radial neighbor might be at in ring k-1, at a corresponding position.

For example, for cell 8 in ring 2, s=0, t=0, inward neighbors cell 7 in ring 1, which is at s=5, t=0 or something.

Cell 7 is at ring 1, s=5, t=0, since for ring 1, s= floor((7-1)/1)=6, but s only 0 to 5, m=7, s= floor(6/1)=6, which is s=0 of next, not good.

For cell 8 at (0,-2,2), cell 7 at (0,-1,1), which is at distance 1, in the same direction.

In ring k-1=1, the cell at the same relative position or same direction.

In ring k-1, the cell at s= s, t=t or something.

For cell 8, s=0, t=0 in ring 2.

In ring 1, the cell at s=0, t=0 is cell 2 at (1,-1,0), not cell 7.

So not.

Perhaps for the side s, the inward neighbor is at side s in ring k-1, at index t.

For example, for s=0, cell 2 in ring 1 at t=0, cell 8 in ring 2 at t=0, but cell 2 and cell 8 are adjacent, yes.

Cell 3 in ring 1 at s=1, t=0, cell 9 in ring 2 at s=1, t=0, and they are adjacent if cell 9 is at (1,0,-1) but cell 3 is at (1,0,-1), same cell, not.

In our coordinate, cell 2 at (1,-1,0), cell 8 at (0,-2,2), not adjacent.

So not.

Perhaps it is at s, but different t.

This is not working.

Perhaps for this problem, since 2026 is large, and the sum might be approximately 6*2026 = 12156, but we need exact, and probably not.

Perhaps the sum is 6n - 6k or something.

For n=1, sum 27, 6*1 -6*0=6, not.

For n=2, sum 38, 6*2=12, not.

Another idea: in the spiral, the number at a cell is roughly proportional to the distance squared, since area.

Distance k, number up to ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1) ~ 3k^2, so n ~ 3k^2, so k ~ sqrt(n/3)

For n=2026, k=26, as before.

Then the neighbors are at distance k-1, k, k+1, with numbers roughly 3(k-1)^2 to 3(k+1)^2, but varies.

Perhaps the sum is roughly 6 * 3k^2 = 18k^2, but for n=1, k=0, sum 27, 18*0=0 not.

For n=1, k=0, sum 27.

For n=2, k=1, sum 38.

For n=3, k=1, sum 40.

For n=4, assume sum 58 as above.

So for k=1, n=2,3,4,5,6,7, sum of neighbors for each.

For cell 2: neighbors say 1,3,7,8,9,10 sum 1+3+7+8+9+10=38

Cell 3: 1,2,4,10,11,12 sum 1+2+4+10+11+12=40

Cell 4: 3,5,12,13,14,15 sum 3+5+12+13+14+15=62? But earlier I said 58, let's calculate properly.

From earlier, cell 4 at (0,1,-1)

Neighbors: (0+1,1-1,-1+0) = (1,0,-1) cell 3, (0+1,1+0,-1-1) = (1,1,-2), (0+0,1+1,-1-1) = (0,2,-2), (0-1,1+1,-1+0) = (-1,2,-1), (0-1,1+0,-1+1) = (-1,1,0) cell 5, (0+0,1-1,-1+1) = (0,0,0) cell 1

So cells: cell 3, cell 5, cell 1, and (1,1,-2), (0,2,-2), (-1,2,-1) which are in ring 2, say cell 13,14,15 or something.

So sum 1+3+5 +13+14+15 = 1+3+5=9, 13+14+15=42, sum 51? But earlier I thought 58, so let's assume the numbers are placed as per the spiral.

From the initial diagram, cell 4 is at top-left, adjacent to cell 3 (right), cell 5 ( below-left), cell 1 ( below-right), and then in ring 2, cell 14 ( above-left), cell 10 ( above-right), and cell 15 ( left) or something.

In the snippet: row above: 14,4,3,10 — so cell 4 has left 14, right 3, and below it is cell 5 and 1, but in center row, 15,5,1,2,9, so below 4 is cell 5 and cell 1? But in hex grid, below might be southwest and southeast.

Typically, below cell 4 might be cell 5 ( southwest) and cell 1 ( southeast), but cell 1 is not directly below, but in different position.

In the grid, cell 4 at (0,1,-1), cell 5 at (-1,1,0), cell 1 at (0,0,0), so yes, cell 5 is W or SW, cell 1 is SE or down.

So neighbors of cell 4: cell 3 at (1,0,-1) E or NE, cell 5 at (-1,1,0) W or NW, cell 1 at (0,0,0) S or SE, and then in ring 2, cell 14 at say (0,2,-2) N or NW, cell 10 at (2,-1,-1) E or SE, and cell 15 at (-1,2,-1) W or SW.

In the diagram, cell 14 is left of 4, cell 10 is right of 3, cell 15 is left of 5 or something.

So likely, neighbors are: for cell 4: cell 3 ( right), cell 14 ( left), cell 5 ( below-left), cell 1 ( below-right), cell 10 ( above-right), cell 15 ( above-left) or something.

Numbers: 3,14,5,1,10,15.

Sum 3+14+5+1+10+15 = 3+1+5+10+14+15=48

1+3+5+10+14+15=48

Then for cell 5: similarly, neighbors cell 4, cell 15, cell 6, cell 1, cell 16, cell 9 or something.

In center row: 15,5,1,2,9, so cell 5 has left 15, right 1, below cell 6, and above cell 4, and then cell 16 and cell 9 or something.

Cell 5 at (-1,1,0), neighbors: (-1+1,1-1,0+0) = (0,0,0) cell 1, (-1+1,1+0,0-1) = (0,1,-1) cell 4, (-1-1,1+1,0+0) = (-2,2,0), (-1-1,1+0,0+1) = (-2,1,1), (-1+0,1+1,0-1) = (-1,2,-1), (-1+0,1-1,0+1) = (-1,0,1) cell 6

So cells: cell 1, cell 4, cell 6, and (-2,2,0), (-2,1,1), (-1,2,-1) ring 2 cells.

Sum say 1+4+6 +16+17+18 or something, but not known.

To save time, perhaps for the number 2026, since it's in ring 26, and not on corner, and on s=2 (NW side), t=22, so towards the end of the side.

Then its neighbors can be determined.

Perhaps the sum is 6*2026 - 6*26 or something.

For n=1, sum 27, 6*1 -0 =6 not.

For n=2, 6*2=12, not 38.

Perhaps 6n + 6k.

n=1,k=0, 6+0=6 not 27.

Another thought: in the neighbor sum, since the grid is regular, the sum might be 6n for cells not on the edge, but here all cells are on the edge until very large, but for large n, it might be, but for n=2026, still on edge.

Perhaps for this spiral, the sum of neighbors for a cell in ring k is constant for that ring, but from earlier, for ring 1, cell 2 sum 38, cell 3 sum 40, different.

So not.

Perhaps it depends on the position.

Perhaps for the problem, the number 2026 is chosen because it is on a symmetry, but unlikely.

Perhaps I can compute the number for a smaller n and see the pattern.

Let's take n=8, in ring 2, a2=8, so m=1, s= floor((1-1)/2)= floor(0/2)=0, t=0, corner.

So s=0, t=0.

Then neighbors.

From diagram, cell 8 is at bottom-right, adjacent to cell 7 ( below-left), cell 2 ( above-left), cell 9 ( right), and cell 16 ( left), and cell 1 ( above-right)? But cell 1 is not adjacent.

In the below row: 16,6,7,8, so cell 8 has left 7, and below or above? In its row, left is 7, and below might be nothing, above might be cell 2 or 9.

In the center row, cell 2 is at right of 1, so probably cell 8 is adjacent to cell 2 and cell 7.

Also to cell 9 to its right, and cell 16 to its left, but 16 is left of 6, so perhaps not directly.

In the grid, likely neighbors are: cell 7 ( left), cell 9 ( right), cell 2 ( above-right), cell 1 ( above-left)? But cell 1 may not be adjacent.

From coordinate, if cell 8 at (0,-2,2), then neighbors: (0+1,-2-1,2+0) = (1,-3,2), (0+1,-2+0,2-1) = (1,-2,1), (0+0,-2+1,2-1) = (0,-1,1) cell 7, (0-1,-2+1,2+0) = (-1,-1,2), (0-1,-2+0,2+1) = (-1,-2,3), (0+0,-2-1,2+1) = (0,-3,3)

So cells at (1,-3,2) cell 9, (1,-2,1) may be cell in ring 2 or 1, but cell 2 is at (1,-1,0), not this.

 (0,-1,1) cell 7, (-1,-1,2) may be cell 16 or 19, (-1,-2,3) ring 3, (0,-3,3) ring 3.

So neighbors include cell 7, cell 9, and cells in ring 2 and 3.

Specifically, in the diagram, probably cell 7, cell 9, cell 2, cell 16, and two more.

Assume that cell 8 is adjacent to cell 7, cell 2, cell 9, cell 16, cell 1, and cell 15 or something.

From the spiral order, after 7 is 8, then 9, so 8 is between 7 and 9, so adjacent to 7 and 9.

Also to cell 2, since in the diagram it's close, and to cell 1 or 6.

In some online sources or standard, but since this is a text, perhaps the intended way is to realize that for a cell in the spiral, the neighbors can be found by the numbers around it.

Perhaps for number n, the six neighbors are n-1, n+1, and then the cells at the turns, which for the spiral path, when it turns, but for n not at corner, it might be n-1, n+1, and then n -6k+3, etc.

Perhaps the difference between n and its neighbors is constant for the ring.

For example, in ring k, the numbers are from a_k to b_k, and neighbors are in a_k-6(k-1) to b_k+
