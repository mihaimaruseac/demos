The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid.

From the given snippet, it seems like the center is 1, and then it spirals outward. Let me sketch this out based on the provided numbers.

It shows:

... 14  4  3 10 ...

.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, probably, 1 is at the center. Directly to the right of 1 is 2, and above-right is 3? Let me list the neighbors.

Assuming a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors: up, down, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right. But in the spiral, the numbering might be in a specific order.

Looking at the sequence: starting from 1, then probably 2 is adjacent, then 3, and so on.

From the snippet: around 1, we have 2,5,6,7,8, but 3 and 4 are also nearby.

The numbers given are 14,4,3,10,15,5,1,2,9,16,6,7,8.

Perhaps I should try to map out the grid.

I recall that in hexagonal grids, coordinates can be represented using axial or cube coordinates. But maybe for this spiral, I need to find a pattern or a formula for the position of each number.

Since it's a spiral, the numbers are arranged in rings around the center. Ring 0 is just the center, number 1. Ring 1 might be numbers 2 through 7, since each ring adds more cells.

In a hexagonal grid, the number of cells in ring k (starting from k=0) is 6*k for k>=1, and 1 for k=0.

Ring 0: 1 cell.

Ring 1: 6 cells.

Ring 2: 12 cells? No.

In a hexagonal lattice, the number of cells at distance d from the center.

Distance here is in terms of ring number.

Typically, for a hexagonal spiral, ring n has 6*n cells for n>=1.

Confirming: ring 1: 6 cells, numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the snippet, after 1 is 2, then probably 3,4,5,6,7.

But in the snippet, we have 2,9,8,7,6,5? It's messy.

From the snippet: around 1, we see 2,5,6,7,8,9? But 3 and 4 are also present.

The line is: 15,5,1,2,9 and below 16,6,7,8, and above 14,4,3,10.

So, let's assume the grid is oriented such that horizontal is along the x-axis.

Set 1 at origin.

Directly to the right of 1 is 2.

Then above-right is 3? But in the snippet, above 1 is not directly given, but we have 4 above? Let's see.

The line ".. 15 5 1 2 9 ..." so left of 1 is 5? But 5 is also below? Confusing.

Perhaps the grid is such that from 1, neighbors are: east:2, northeast:3, northwest:4, west:5, southwest:6, southeast:7? But in the snippet, we have 5 left of 1, 2 right of 1, and below 6,7,8, but 8 is southeast? Let's list the cells.

Assume that the center cell is 1.

The cell to the east (right) is 2.

The cell to the northeast is 3? But in the snippet, above-right of 1 is not directly given, but we have "14 4 3" above, and "15 5" left, "16 6" below-left, "7 8" below-right, "9" below-east? This is messy.

From the sequence: after 1, the next number is 2 (east), then probably 3 (northeast), then 4 (northwest), then 5 (west), then 6 (southwest), then 7 (south), then 8 (southeast), then 9 (east of 2?), but 2 is at (1,0) say, then 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,0), 6 at (-1,-1), 7 at (0,-1), 8 at (1,-1), then 9 at (2,-1)? But in the snippet, we have 9 next to 2, which is at (1,0), so east of 2 should be 9? But 9 is listed after 8, and before 10, but in the snippet, after 2 is 9, so yes.

In the line: "15 5 1 2 9" so from left to right: 15,5,1,2,9. But in a hexagonal grid, rows are offset, so it's not a straight line.

Probably, the row with 1,2 is not aligned with the row with 5, etc.

To make it easier, I should assign coordinates.

I recall that in hexagonal grids, we can use cube coordinates or axial coordinates. Let's use axial coordinates with q and r.

Set the center at (0,0).

Assume the neighbors are at:

East: (1,0)

Northeast: (1,1)? But in axial, distance might not be 1.

Standard axial coordinates: let q be the column, r be the row.

For a hexagon at (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1). But the distances: the vector between (q,r) and (q+1,r) is not the same as to (q,r+1), so usually we use cube coordinates for equal distance.

Cube coordinates: each hex has coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0.

Then neighbors are at (x+1,y-1,z), (x+1,y,z-1), (x,y+1,z-1), (x-1,y+1,z), (x-1,y,z+1), (x,y-1,z+1). But since x+y+z=0, we can use two coordinates.

Standard is to use two coordinates, say q and r, and the third is -q-r.

Neighbors are: (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)? Let's define.

Typically, for axial coordinates, the six neighbors are:

- +q: (q+1, r)

- -q: (q-1, r)

- +r: (q, r+1)

- -r: (q, r-1)

- +s: (q-1, r+1) if s is the third direction, but usually it's defined as:

The directions are: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1). Yes, that's standard.

So vectors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1).

Each has magnitude sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 1*0) but in hex distance, it's 1.

Now, for the spiral, it starts at (0,0) with 1.

Then it moves to the east, to (1,0) with 2.

Then to northeast, to (1,1) with 3? But in the snippet, after 2 is probably 3 at northeast, but let's see what is next.

From the snippet, after 1 is 2, then 3 is somewhere, but in the line "1 2 9" so 2 is next to 1 and 9, but 3 is not adjacent to 1? In the snippet, "14 4 3" is above, and "4 3" are together, and 4 is left of 3 or something.

Perhaps the spiral goes: from 1 to 2 (east), then instead of northeast, it goes north or something.

Let's list the numbers in order and assign positions.

Start at (0,0): 1.

Then move east to (1,0): 2.

Now, from here, it could go northeast to (1,1) or southeast to (1,-1), or back, but since it's a spiral, it should go to the next cell in the ring.

Typically, in hexagonal spirals, after placing the center, you move in a direction and place numbers as you go around.

From online sources or memory, I recall that for a hexagonal spiral, the sequence is defined by moving in a counter-clockwise or clockwise direction.

From the given numbers, let's try to map it.

From the snippet:

The row below: "16 6 7 8" so probably 6,7,8 are in a row, with 6 left, then 7, then 8.

Above that, "15 5 1 2 9" so 15,5,1,2,9.

Above that, "14 4 3 10" so 14,4,3,10.

And dots indicate it continues.

Also, between rows, there might be offset.

In hexagonal grid, rows are offset by half a cell.

For example, the row with 1,2 might be at r=0, with q=0:1, q=1:2.

Then the row above at r=1, might have q=0: something, q=1:3, q=2:4? But in snippet, we have "14 4 3" and 3 is at q=1,r=1? Then 4 at q=2,r=1? But then "10" at q=3,r=1?

Then below, at r=-1, we have "16 6 7 8", so 6 at q= -1,r= -1? 7 at q=0,r= -1, 8 at q=1,r= -1?

Then the row with 15,5,1,2,9: this might be r=0, with q= -2:15? q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9.

Then above at r=1, q= -1:14? q=0:4? q=1:3, q=2:10? But 4 and 3 are at q=0 and q=1, but in axial coordinates, (0,1) and (1,1) are adjacent, which is good.

But (0,0) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (0,1) is 4? But in the snippet, above 1 is 4? But 1 is at (0,0), neighbor northeast should be (1,1) or (0,1)? Let's see the neighbors of (0,0).

Neighbors are:

(1,0): east

(0,1): north? in some systems, but in axial, (0,1) is northeast or northwest?

The vector from (0,0) to (1,0) is east.

To (0,1): if we consider q horizontal, r vertical, then (0,1) is up, but in hex grid, it's not directly up; it's offset.

The distance between (0,0) and (0,1) is |0-0| + |0-1| + |0-(-1)|? In cube coordinates, distance is max(|dx|,|dy|,|dz|), but in axial, the distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr|)? Standard hex distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 where ds = -dq-dr, but since ds is determined, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr|)/2? No.

For axial coordinates (q,r), the distance to (0,0) is (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2? Let's calculate.

For (1,0): |1| + |0| + |1+0| =1+0+1=2, divided by 2 is 1, good.

For (0,1): |0| + |1| + |0+1| =0+1+1=2, /2=1, good.

For (1,1): |1| + |1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, /2=2, which is correct for diagonal.

Now, neighbors of (0,0) are all cells at distance 1: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)? Let's list vectors that give distance 1.

The vectors are (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)? For (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, /2=1, yes. Similarly for (-1,1): | -1| + |1| + | -1+1| =1+1+0=2/2=1.

And (1,1): as above, distance 2.

So neighbors are: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1).

In the grid, from the snippet, at (0,0):1.

(1,0):2.

(0,1):? in snippet, above 1 is 4? But in "14 4 3" and "15 5 1 2 9", so above 1 is probably 4 or 3.

The cell directly "above" might be (0,1), but in the row above, at r=1, q=0 is 4, q=1 is 3.

But (0,1) should be adjacent to (0,0), which it is, distance 1.

Similarly, (0,-1) should be below, in snippet "16 6 7 8", and 6 is at q= -1,r= -1? Earlier I had at r= -1, q= -1:16? q=0:6? q=1:7? q=2:8? But (0,-1) is at r= -1, q=0, which should be 6.

But is (0,-1) adjacent to (0,0)? Yes, distance 1.

Now, what are the neighbors of 1 at (0,0):

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):4? but in snippet, at (0,1) is 4? but we have 3 at (1,1), which is also adjacent.

But in the spiral, what number is at each.

From the sequence, after 1 at (0,0), it goes to (1,0):2.

Then where next? Probably to a new cell, not back. So it could go to (1,1) or (1,-1) or (0,1), etc.

In the snippet, after 2 is 9? No, the sequence is 1,2, then next should be 3, but in the grid, 3 is at (1,1), which is northeast of 2.

From (1,0), northeast is (2,0)? No, neighbors of (1,0) are: (2,0), (1,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (2,-1), (0,1)? Let's list:

Vectors: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1) applied to (1,0):

(1+1,0+0)=(2,0)

(1-1,0+0)=(0,0)

(1+0,0+1)=(1,1)

(1+0,0-1)=(1,-1)

(1+1,0-1)=(2,-1)

(1-1,0+1)=(0,1)

So neighbors: (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,-1), (0,1).

(0,0) is already occupied by 1, so new cells are (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,-1), (0,1).

In the spiral, after 2 at (1,0), it should go to one of these. Typically, it might go to (1,1) or (2,0).

In the snippet, at (1,1) is 3, and at (2,0) is 9? But 9 is later, so probably it goes to (1,1) for 3.

Then from 3 at (1,1), neighbors include (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (1,0), etc. (1,0) is occupied, so new cells.

It might go to (0,1) or (2,1) or (1,2).

In snippet, at (0,1) is 4, at (2,1) is 10? later, at (1,2) not given.

And at (0,1) is 4, which is adjacent to both (0,0) and (1,1).

So likely, after 3 at (1,1), it goes to (0,1) for 4.

Then from 4 at (0,1), neighbors include (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0), (-1,2)? etc.

(0,0) occupied, (1,1) occupied, so new cells: (-1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), etc.

In snippet, at (-1,1) is 14? in "14 4 3", and 14 is left of 4, so probably (-1,1) is 14? but 14 is larger, so it should be later in the spiral.

I think I have the order wrong.

The number at (0,1) is 4, but 4 is small, so it should be early.

But in the spiral sequence, after 1,2,3, then 4.

From 3 at (1,1), it goes to (0,1) for 4.

Then from 4, where to next? It could go to (-1,1) or (0,2) or down to (0,0) but occupied.

Typically, it might go west to (-1,1) for 5? but in snippet, at (-1,1) is 14? no, in the row below, at r=0, q=-1 is 5, from "15 5 1 2 9" so q=-1,r=0 is 5.

But ( -1,0) is west of (0,0), so at ( -1,0) is 5.

But (0,1) is not adjacent to (-1,0)? Distance between (0,1) and (-1,0): |0-(-1)| + |1-0| + |0+1 +1-0| wait, dq = -1, dr = -1, ds = -dq-dr =1+1=2, distance (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 = (1+1+2)/2=2, not adjacent.

So (0,1) and (-1,0) are not neighbors.

From 4 at (0,1), it might go to (-1,1) for the next number.

In snippet, at (-1,1) is 14? but 14 is larger, while next number should be 5.

Perhaps (0,1) is 4, then it goes down to (0,0) but occupied, or to ( -1,1).

Let's list the cells in order.

Assume the spiral goes clockwise or counter-clockwise.

From the center 1, it goes east to 2.

Then, instead of northeast, it might go north to (0,1), but in our case, (0,1) is 4, but after 2 should be 3.

Perhaps it goes southeast or something.

Another possibility: after 1, it goes to 2 east, then to 3 southeast to (1,-1), but in snippet at (1,-1) is 8? which is later.

Let's look at the numbers around.

The cell at (0,-1) is 6, from snippet.

Cell at (-1,0) is 5.

Cell at (0,1) is 4.

Cell at (1,1) is 3.

Cell at (1,0) is 2.

Cell at (1,-1) is 8? in "7 8" and "6 7 8", so at r= -1, q=1 is 8, q=0 is 7? earlier I said q=0,r= -1 is 6? no.

From "16 6 7 8" at r= -1, and assuming q increases to the right, so probably q= -2:16? no, "16 6 7 8" so if it's a row, q= -1:16? but 16 is large, likely not.

Perhaps the row is not all at same r.

In hexagonal grid, each row has constant r or constant q.

Usually, we set r constant for rows.

So for the row at r=0: cells with r=0, q integer.

From "15 5 1 2 9" so q= -2:15? q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9.

Row at r=1: "14 4 3 10" so q= -1:14? q=0:4, q=1:3, q=2:10.

Row at r= -1: "16 6 7 8" so q= -1:16? q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8.

But then at r=1, q=0 is 4, r=0 q=0 is 1, so (0,1) and (0,0) are adjacent, good.

Now, the number at (1,1) is 3, at (0,1) is 4, at (-1,0) is 5, at (0,-1) is 6, at (1,-1) is 7? in r= -1, q=1 is 7? but in "7 8" so if q=1:7, q=2:8, so at (1,-1) is 7, (2,-1) is 8.

At (2,0) is 9, from r=0 q=2:9.

Now, neighbors of 1 at (0,0):

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):4

- (-1,1): but (-1,1) is at r=1 q= -1, which is 14, but 14 is large, not a neighbor? distance from (0,0) to (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds= -(-1)-1=1-1=0? in cube, x=q, y=r, z= -q-r, so from (0,0,0) to (-1,1,0) since -(-1)-1=0, distance |dx| + |dy| + |dz| = | -1-0| + |1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent. So not a neighbor.

The neighbors are:

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):4

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):6

- (1,-1):7

- (-1,1): but (-1,1) is not adjacent, as distance 2.

Who is the sixth neighbor? ( -1,1) is not adjacent, (1,1) is at (1,1), distance |1-0| + |1-0| + |2-0|? dx=1, dy=1, dz= -2? from (0,0,0) to (1,1,-2), |1| + |1| + | -2| =4, distance 2.

The correct neighbors are only the six at distance 1: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)? earlier calculation for (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds = -dq-dr =1-1=0, so in cube, x=q= -1, y=r=1, z= -q-r = -(-1)-1=1-1=0, so (-1,1,0), distance | -1-0| + |1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, not 1. So not adjacent.

What is the sixth neighbor? (1,-1): dq=1, dr= -1, ds= -1-(-1)=0, so (1,-1,0), distance |1| + | -1| + |0| =2, not 1.

I think I have a mistake.

For (0,0), neighbors should be at (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)? but as above, (1,-1) has distance 2.

Let's calculate distance properly.

In cube coordinates, distance between (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) is (|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| + |z1-z2|)/2, and for adjacent, it should be 1, so |dx| + |dy| + |dz| =2.

For (1,0): x=1,y=0,z= -1, |1-0| + |0-0| + | -1-0| =1+0+1=2, good.

For (0,1): x=0,y=1,z= -1, |0-0| + |1-0| + | -1-0| =0+1+1=2, good.

For (-1,0): x= -1,y=0,z=1, | -1-0| + |0-0| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2, good.

For (0,-1): x=0,y= -1,z=1, |0-0| + | -1-0| + |1-0| =0+1+1=2, good.

For (1,-1): x=1,y= -1,z=0, |1-0| + | -1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, good.

For (-1,1): x= -1,y=1,z=0, | -1-0| + |1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, good.

Oh, I miscalculated earlier. For (1,-1), z= -q-r = -1-(-1) = -1+1=0, so (1,-1,0), |1-0| + | -1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, yes distance 1.

Similarly for (-1,1): (-1,1,0), | -1-0| + |1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, distance 1.

So neighbors of (0,0) are: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1).

In the grid, at:

(1,0):2

(0,1):4

(-1,0):5

(0,-1):6

(1,-1):7

(-1,1):14? in r=1 q= -1 is 14, but 14 is larger than 7, while the numbers should be small for neighbors.

But in the spiral, the neighbors are not necessarily in order; the numbering is spiral, so the number at a cell depends on when it's filled.

For example, at (-1,1) is 14, which is later, while at (1,-1) is 7, which is earlier.

So for cell (0,0):1, neighbors are:

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):4

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):6

- (1,-1):7

- (-1,1):14

Yes, as per snippet.

Similarly, for other cells.

Now, the spiral path: it starts at 1: (0,0)

Then moves to 2: (1,0)

Then to 3: where? not yet assigned. From the sequence, after 2 should be 3.

In the grid, 3 is at (1,1), as per snippet r=1 q=1:3.

Is (1,1) adjacent to (1,0)? Distance: dq=0, dr=1, ds= -0-1= -1, |0| + |1| + | -1| =2, distance 1, yes.

So from (1,0) to (1,1) for 3.

Then from (1,1) to where? Adjacent cells: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (0,2)? (1,0) occupied, (0,1) is not occupied yet? at (0,1) is 4, which is next.

So to (0,1) for 4.

Then from (0,1) to where? Adjacent cells: (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1), (0,0), (-1,2), (1,2)? (0,0) and (1,1) occupied, so new cells: (1,2), (0,2), (-1,1), (-1,2), etc.

In snippet, at (-1,1) is 14, large, at (0,2) not given, at (1,2) not given.

But next number is 5, which is at (-1,0).

Is (-1,0) adjacent to (0,1)? Distance: dq= -1, dr= -1, ds= -(-1)-(-1)=1+1=2? cube: from (0,1,-1) to (-1,0,1), dx= -1, dy= -1, dz=2, | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent. So not directly adjacent.

From (0,1), it might go to (-1,1) for 5? but 5 is small, while (-1,1) is 14, large.

Perhaps after 4 at (0,1), it goes down to (0,0) but occupied, or to ( -1,1), but that's 14 later.

Perhaps the path is different.

After 2 at (1,0), it goes to 3 at (1,1), then to 4 at (0,1), then to 5 at (-1,0)? but not adjacent.

Perhaps from (1,0) it goes to (1,-1) for 3, but in snippet (1,-1) is 7.

Let's list the cells in the order of numbering.

From the snippet and the spiral, likely:

1: (0,0)

2: (1,0)

3: (1,1)

4: (0,1)

Then 5: where? at (-1,0) is 5, and it should be adjacent to 1 or 2 or 4? adjacent to 1 at (0,0), since (-1,0) is neighbor of (0,0).

But from 4 at (0,1), how to get to (-1,0)? not directly adjacent, so perhaps after 4, it goes to another cell.

Perhaps after 1,2,3,4, then it goes down to 5 at (-1,0), but again not adjacent to 4.

Perhaps the spiral goes: from 1 to 2 east, then to 3 north-east to (1,1), then to 4 north-west to (0,1), then to 5 west to (-1,1)? but (-1,1) is 14, not 5.

5 is at (-1,0), which is west of (0,0).

So perhaps after 4, it goes back to a cell near center, but that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: after placing 1, it places the first ring: cells at distance 1: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In order: say 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1), 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (0,-1), but in our grid, at (-1,1) is 14, not 5, and at (0,-1) is 6, at (-1,0) is 5, at (1,-1) is 7.

So perhaps the order is 2:(1,0), 3:(1,1), 4:(0,1), 5:(-1,0), 6:(0,-1), 7:(1,-1).

Is that possible? From 4 at (0,1) to 5 at (-1,0): not adjacent, as distance 2.

From 4 to 5 not adjacent, but in spiral path, it might not be adjacent in path, but the cells are filled in order, not necessarily adjacent in the path.

In a spiral, the path is continuous, so each step moves to an adjacent cell.

So the sequence must be a path where each step is to an adjacent cell.

So from 1 to 2: (0,0) to (1,0)

2 to 3: (1,0) to (1,1) or to (0,0) or to (2,0) or to (1,-1), etc.

If to (1,1) for 3, then 3 to 4: from (1,1) to (0,1) for 4, since adjacent.

Then from 4 at (0,1) to where? Adjacent cells: (1,1): occupied, (0,0): occupied, ( -1,1): not occupied, (0,2): not occupied, (1,2): not occupied, ( -1,2): etc.

The next number is 5, which is at (-1,0), but (-1,0) is not adjacent to (0,1), as distance 2.

So it can't be.

From 4, it could go to ( -1,1) for the next number, but in the grid, (-1,1) is 14, which is later, while 5 is at (-1,0), which is not adjacent.

Perhaps after 3 at (1,1), it goes to (0,1) for 4, then to ( -1,1) for 5, but then 5 should be at (-1,1), but in the grid, at (-1,1) is 14, not 5, and at (-1,0) is 5, so not.

Unless the grid is different.

Perhaps the coordinate system is oriented differently.

Another idea: perhaps the "northeast" is not (0,1), but (1,1) or something.

Let's look at the snippet again.

" ... 14 4 3 10 ... " this is the top row.

".. 15 5 1 2 9 ... " middle row.

"... 16 6 7 8 ... " bottom row.

In hexagonal grid, the middle row has cells at y=0, top row at y=1, bottom at y= -1, and within a row, x-coordinates.

For y=0: x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

For y=1: x= -1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10

For y= -1: x= -1:16, x=0:6, x=1:7, x=2:8

Now, the cell at (x,y) = (0,0):1

(1,0):2

(0,1):4

(1,1):3

( -1,0):5

(0,-1):6

(1,-1):7

( -1,1):14

(2,0):9

(2,1):10

( -1,-1):16

(2,-1):8

Now, distance between (0,1) and ( -1,0): let's calculate.

In this coordinate, what is the distance.

Typically in hex grid with axial or offset, but here if we assume that the distance is based on hex adjacency.

Cell (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), ( -1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), and also to (1,-1)? or ( -1,1)? 

Cell (0,0) and (1,0): adjacent, since in same row, different column, but in hex, usually adjacent if |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, but not both 0, and for even row or odd row, but here rows are not offset in the snippet; in "15 5 1 2 9" all at y=0, so probably this is a straight row, so cells are not offset, so it might be a different grid.

In a hexagonal grid, when you lay it out, rows are offset, so for example, the row above might have cells between the below row.

But in the snippet, the rows are aligned, with "14 4 3 10" directly above "15 5 1 2 9", so 14 above 15, 4 above 5, 3 above 1, 10 above 2, but 3 is above 1, 4 above 5, which is not directly above, so probably it is offset.

In "14 4 3 10" at y=1, "15 5 1 2 9" at y=0, so cell at x=0,y=1 is 4, x=0,y=0 is 1, so directly "above" in y-direction, but in hex grid, cell (0,1) is not directly above (0,0); it's offset.

But in this case, 4 is above 1, but 5 is at x= -1,y=0, and 14 at x= -1,y=1, so 14 above 15? 15 is at x= -2,y=0, so not.

Perhaps the x-coordinates are not aligned.

For cell at y=0, x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

At y=1, x= -1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10

So for example, cell (0,0):1, cell (0,1):4, cell (1,0):2, cell (1,1):3, cell (-1,0):5, cell (-1,1):14, etc.

Now, cell (0,0) and (0,1): if y is the row, and x the column, in hex grid, cells with the same y are in the same row, and for adjacent rows, cells are offset by half, so that cell (x,y) is adjacent to (x,y-1), (x,y+1), (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1) or something.

Typically, for a 'pointy-top' hex grid, cell (x,y) is adjacent to (x±1,y), (x,y±1), and (x±1,y∓1) or something.

Let's see adjacency.

Cell (0,0):1 is adjacent to (1,0):2, and to (0,1):4? but in the grid, is 4 adjacent to 1? From the numbers, 1 is at (0,0), 4 at (0,1), and they are both present, and in the spiral, they are close, but are they neighbors? In the snippet, no direct indication, but from the values, 1 and 4 are both small, likely adjacent.

Similarly, 1 and 5 at (-1,0):5, likely adjacent.

1 and 6 at (0,-1):6, adjacent.

1 and 2 at (1,0):2, adjacent.

Then the sixth should be either (1,-1) or (-1,1), but (1,-1) is 7, ( -1,1) is 14.

7 is smaller, so likely (1,-1):7 is the sixth neighbor.

So assume that the grid is such that cell (x,y) is adjacent to (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1)? but that would be 8 directions, but hex has 6.

Standard is that for axial coordinates, as I had earlier, with neighbors at (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y干1) with the sign.

In this case, from (0,0) to (1,0): good.

 to (-1,0): good.

 to (0,1): good.

 to (0,-1): good.

 to (1,-1): good, as 7 is there.

 to (-1,1): 14 is there, but 14 is not a neighbor if it's distance 2, but earlier calculation showed distance 1 in cube coords.

In this coordinate system, let's define cube coordinates.

Let s = -x -y, then distance is (|dx| + |dy| + |ds|)/2.

From (0,0) to (1,0): dx=1, dy=0, ds= -1-0= -1? s = -x -y, so at (0,0), s=0.

At (1,0), s= -1-0= -1.

dx=1, dy=0, ds= -1-0= -1, |1| + |0| + | -1| =2, distance 1.

To (0,1): s= -0-1= -1, dx=0, dy=1, ds= -1-0= -1, |0| + |1| + | -1| =2, distance 1.

To (-1,0): s= -(-1)-0=1, dx= -1, dy=0, ds=1-0=1, | -1| + |0| + |1| =2, distance 1.

To (0,-1): s= -0-(-1)=1, dx=0, dy= -1, ds=1-0=1, |0| + | -1| + |1| =2, distance 1.

To (1,-1): s= -1-(-1)=0, dx=1, dy= -1, ds=0-0=0, |1| + | -1| + |0| =2, distance 1.

To (-1,1): s= -(-1)-1=0, dx= -1, dy=1, ds=0-0=0, | -1| + |1| + |0| =2, distance 1.

So yes, all six are adjacent.

In the grid, for (0,0):1, neighbors are (1,0):2, (0,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7, (-1,1):14.

14 is a neighbor, even though it's larger number, because it's filled later.

For the spiral path, after 1 at (0,0), it goes to 2 at (1,0).

Then from 2, it can go to (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (0,0), etc.

(0,0) occupied, so to (2,0) or (1,1) or (1,-1).

In the grid, at (2,0) is 9, at (1,1) is 3, at (1,-1) is 7.

3 is smaller, so likely to (1,1) for 3.

Then from 3 at (1,1), adjacent cells: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (1,0), (0,0), (2,0)? (1,0) and (0,0) occupied, so new: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (2,0).

At (0,1) is 4, smaller, so to (0,1) for 4.

Then from 4 at (0,1), adjacent cells: (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1), (0,0), (-1,2), (1,2)? (0,0) and (1,1) occupied, so new: (0,2), (-1,1), (1,2), (-1,2), etc.

Next number is 5, at (-1,0).

Is (-1,0) adjacent to (0,1)? Distance: from (0,1) to (-1,0): dx= -1, dy= -1, ds= -(-1)-(-1)? s = -x-y, at (0,1) s= -0-1= -1, at (-1,0) s= -(-1)-0=1, so dx= -1-0= -1, dy=0-1= -1, ds=1-(-1)=2, | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent. So cannot go directly.

At (-1,1) is 14, large, so not.

Perhaps from 4, it goes to (1,2) or (0,2), but not assigned yet.

Perhaps after 3, it goes to (2,0) for 4, but (2,0) is 9 later, and at (0,1) is 4, so not.

Perhaps the path is: 1:(0,0), 2:(1,0), 3:(2,0)? but in grid (2,0) is 9, not 3.

3 is at (1,1).

Another idea: after 2 at (1,0), it goes to 3 at (1,-1) for 3, but in grid (1,-1) is 7.

7 is larger.

Perhaps it goes to (0,-1) for 3, but (0,-1) is 6.

Let's list the cells with their numbers:

- (0,0):1

- (1,0):2

- (1,1):3

- (0,1):4

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):6

- (1,-1):7

- (2,-1):8  from r= -1, q=2:8

- (2,0):9

- (2,1):10

- (-1,1):14

- (-1,-1):16

- (-2,0):15

- (-2,1): not given, but probably 13 or something.

Now, after 4 at (0,1), the next cell in path must be adjacent and not occupied, and have number 5.

Possible cells adjacent to (0,1): (1,1):3 occupied, (0,0):1 occupied, ( -1,1):14, (0,2): not assigned, (1,2): not assigned, ( -1,2): not assigned.

None of them have number 5; 5 is at (-1,0), not adjacent.

Unless ( -1,0) is adjacent, but we saw it's not.

Perhaps the grid is "flat-top" instead of "pointy-top".

In flat-top, the coordinates might be different.

Perhaps y is not the row, but something else.

Another possibility: in the snippet, the row "15 5 1 2 9" is not a straight line; in hex grid, when displayed, the cells are staggered.

So for example, cell 1 at center, cell 2 is to the east, cell 5 is to the west, cell 3 is to the northeast, cell 4 to the northwest, cell 6 to the southwest, cell 7 to the south, etc.

From the numbers, likely:

- East of 1:2

- Northeast of 1:3? but in snippet, above-right is 3? but in "3" is at (1,1), which is northeast of (0,0).

- Northwest of 1:4 at (0,1)? but (0,1) is north, not northwest.

Perhaps ( -1,1) is northwest, but it's 14.

Let's calculate the direction.

From (0,0) to (1,1): dx=1, dy=1, which is northeast.

To ( -1,1): dx= -1, dy=1, northwest.

To ( -1,0): dx= -1, dy=0, west.

To (0,-1): dx=0, dy= -1, south.

To (1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1, southeast.

To (0,1): dx=0, dy=1, north.

So in this system, the six directions are: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast? but north and south are also there, but in this case, (0,1) is north, (0,-1) is south, (1,0) east, (-1,0) west, (1,1) northeast, (-1,1) northwest, (1,-1) southeast, (-1,-1) southwest.

But then for a cell, it has neighbors in all eight directions if we include north and south, but that's not hexagonal; it's square grid with diagonals.

In this coordinate, cell (0,0) has neighbors at (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), which is 8 directions, but hexagonal grid should have only 6 neighbors.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors, not 8.

In this layout, if cells are at all integer (x,y), then each cell has up to 8 neighbors, which is for a square grid, not hexagonal.

For a hexagonal grid, the cells are not on a square lattice; they are on a hexagonal lattice, so not all integer coordinates are occupied, or the adjacency is different.

In the snippet, the cells are not on a square grid; for example, cell at (0,1) is north of (0,0), but in a hexagonal grid, the cell directly north would not be at the same x; it would be offset.

In the given snippet, for the middle row "15 5 1 2 9" at y=0, then above "14 4 3 10" at y=1, but 14 is above the gap between 15 and 5, 4 is above 5, 3 is above 1, 10 is above 2, so it's offset; for even y or something.

Typically, for even y, the row is shifted.

For example, at y=0, cells at x even or odd.

In this case, at y=0, cells at x= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 all present, so probably not offset; it's a different grid.

Perhaps it is a square grid, but the spiral is on a hexagonal pattern, but the grid is square, but the adjacency is hexagonal, which is not standard.

Perhaps the "hexagonal grid" means that the cells are hexagons, but arranged in a way that the spiral is hexagonal, but the coordinate system is Cartesian.

To save time, I am considering that the spiral is standard, and I can look for a formula online or recall that in hexagonal spirals, the ring number can be found, and the position.

I recall that for a hexagonal number spiral, the number at ring n is from 3n(n-1)+2 to 3n(n+1)+1 or something.

Let's calculate the ring for each cell.

The center cell 1 is ring 0.

Cells at distance 1: the 6 neighbors, numbers 2 to 7.

In our case, 2,3,4,5,6,7 are all at distance 1 from 1, as per earlier calculation, and their numbers are 2,3,4,5,6,7, so yes, ring 1 has 6 cells: 2 to 7.

Then ring 2 should have cells at distance 2, which should be 12 cells, numbers 8 to 19 or something.

In the snippet, at (2,0):9, (2,1):10, (2,-1):8, ( -2,0):15, ( -1,1):14, ( -1,-1):16, and also (0,2), (0,-2), (1,2), (1,-2), ( -1,2), ( -1,-2), etc.

From the numbers, 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,1), 14 at (-1,1), 15 at (-2,0), 16 at (-1,-1), and probably 11 at (1,2), 12 at (0,2), 13 at (-1,2), 17 at (-2,1), 18 at (-2,-1), 19 at (-1,-2), etc.

So ring 2 has numbers 8 to 19, 12 cells.

Then ring 3 has 18 cells, 20 to 37, and so on.

General: ring n (n>=1) has 6*n cells.

Ring 0: 1 cell, number 1.

Ring 1: 6 cells, numbers 2 to 7.

Ring 2: 12 cells, numbers 8 to 19. 19-8+1=12, yes.

Ring 3: 18 cells, numbers 20 to 37. 37-20+1=18, yes.

The last number of ring n is 1 + sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 6* n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Sum from k=1 to n of 6k = 6* n(n+1)/2 = 3n(n+1)

So the last number of ring n is 1 + 3n(n+1)

For ring 0, last number 1, 1 + 3*0*1 =1, good.

Ring 1: 1 + 3*1*2 =1+6=7, good.

Ring 2: 1+3*2*3=1+18=19, good.

Ring 3:1+3*3*4=1+36=37, good.

The first number of ring n is the last of ring n-1 plus 1, so for n>=1, first number is [1 + 3(n-1)n] +1 = 3n(n-1) +2

For ring 1: 3*1*0 +2=2, good.

Ring 2:3*2*1+2=6+2=8, good.

Ring 3:3*3*2+2=18+2=20, good.

Now, for a given number m, I need to find which ring it is in, and its position in the ring.

First, find the smallest n such that 1 + 3n(n+1) >= m.

Since last number of ring n is L(n) = 3n(n+1) +1

Set L(n) >= m, find n.

L(n) = 3n^2 + 3n +1

Solve 3n^2 + 3n +1 = m

n = [-3 ± sqrt(9 - 12(1-m))]/6 = [-3 ± sqrt(12m -3)]/6

Since n>0, n = [ -3 + sqrt(12m -3) ] / 6

Then floor or ceiling to get integer n.

Since L(n) is increasing, find n such that L(n-1) < m <= L(n)

L(n) = 3n^2 + 3n +1

For m=2026, compute L(n) >=2026.

3n^2 +3n +1 >=2026

3n^2 +3n -2025 >=0

n^2 + n -675 >=0

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704>2701, 51.9^2=2693.61, 51.95^2=51.95*51.95.

52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97

So n >= [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈25.485

So n >= 26? Since n integer, n>25.485, so n=26.

Check L(25) = 3*25*26 +1 = 3*650 +1=1950+1=1951

L(26)=3*26*27 +1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107

m=2026, 1951 < 2026 <= 2107, so yes, ring n=26.

First number of ring n is F(n) = 3n(n-1) +2

For n=26, F(26)=3*26*25 +2=3*650+2=1950+2=1952

So numbers from 1952 to 2107.

The number m=2026 is in this ring.

The position in the ring: the index from the start.

The ring has 6*n = 6*26=156 cells.

The number at position k in the ring is F(n) + k -1, for k=1 to 156.

So for m=2026, k = m - F(n) +1 = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 74+1=75? 2026-1952=74, so k=75? Since F(n) is number 1 in ring, so index k=1 corresponds to F(n), so k = m - F(n) +1

m - F(n) =2026-1952=74, so k=75.

So it is the 75th cell in ring 26.

Now, the ring has 6 sides, each with n cells? For ring n, there are 6 sides, each side has n cells, since 6n cells.

For example, ring 1: 6 cells, each "side" has 1 cell.

Ring 2: 12 cells, each side has 2 cells.

Yes.

The ring starts at a certain position and goes in a certain direction.

Typically, for hexagonal spiral, it starts at the "east" or "southeast" of the previous ring.

For example, from ring 0 to ring 1: ring 1 starts at (1,0) for number 2, which is east of center.

Then it goes counter-clockwise or clockwise.

In our earlier snippet, for ring 1: cells are added: 2:(1,0), then 3:(1,1), 4:(0,1), 5:(-1,0)? but earlier we had issue.

From the grid, after center, first cell is (1,0):2, then next is (1,1):3, then (0,1):4, then probably (-1,1): but in our grid (-1,1) is in ring 2, not ring 1.

For ring 1, the cells are only the six at distance 1: (1,0):2, (1,1):3? no, (1,1) is at distance sqrt(2) in Cartesian, but in hex distance, as calculated, |dx|+|dy|+|ds|)/2 = |1|+|1|+|2|/2? earlier for (1,1): dx=1,dy=1,dz= -2? s= -x-y= -1-1= -2, |1-0| + |1-0| + | -2-0| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, so in ring 2.

Mistake here.

For cell (x,y), distance from (0,0) is (|x| + |y| + |x+y|)/2? no, in cube coordinates, with s= -x-y, distance is (|x| + |y| + |s|)/2, but s= -x-y, so |x| + |y| + |x+y|.

For (1,0): |1|+|0|+|1+0|=1+0+1=2, /2=1

For (0,1):0+1+1=2,/2=1

For (1,1):|1|+|1|+|2|=1+1+2=4,/2=2

For (2,0):|2|+|0|+|2|=2+0+2=4,/2=2

For (1,-1):|1|+|-1|+|0|=1+1+0=2,/2=1

For (-1,0):1+0+1=2,/2=1

For (0,-1):0+1+1=2,/2=1

For (-1,1):1+1+0=2,/2=1? | -1| + |1| + | -1+1| =1+1+0=2,/2=1, but earlier I thought it was distance 1, but in ring 1, only cells at distance 1 are included, but (-1,1) is at distance 1, so it should be in ring 1.

But in our grid, at (-1,1) is 14, which is in ring 2 or higher.

For ring 1, cells at distance 1: all cells with (|x| + |y| + |x+y|)/2 =1, which requires that the sum |x| + |y| + |x+y| =2.

Possible cells: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)

As listed, and also (0,0) but distance 0.

So six cells.

In the grid, these should be numbers 2 to 7.

From snippet:

(1,0):2

(0,1):4

(-1,0):5

(0,-1):6

(1,-1):7

(-1,1):14? but 14 is not 3 or something.

14 is larger, so probably (-1,1) is not in ring 1; it is in ring 2.

But according to distance, it should be distance 1.

Unless the coordinate system is different.

Perhaps for cell (x,y), the actual hex distance is different.

Perhaps the "distance" for rings is not Euclidean or hex distance, but ring distance based on the spiral.

In the spiral, the ring n consists of cells that are exactly n steps from the center in terms of ring number, which may not be the same as geometric distance if the grid is not symmetric, but in hexagonal grid, it should be.

Perhaps in this grid, the cell (-1,1) is not adjacent to (0,0), but in the snippet, it is not shown as adjacent.

From the numbers, cell 1 is at (0,0), cell 14 at (-1,1), and there is cell 5 at (-1,0), cell 4 at (0,1), etc.

Cell 1 and cell 14 are not adjacent; there is cell 5 and cell 4 in between.

So likely, the distance is greater than 1.

Perhaps the grid is such that cells are only at positions where x+y is even or something, but in this case, all integer (x,y) are occupied, and for (0,0) x+y=0 even, (1,0)1 odd, (0,1)1 odd, etc, so mixed.

For adjacency, perhaps only cells with the same parity or different.

Let's assume that two cells are adjacent if |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, and |dx| + |dy| =1 or something, but that would give only orthogonal, not diagonal.

Perhaps in this grid, it is a square grid, and hexagonal adjacency means that each cell has six neighbors by including only some diagonals, but that would be irregular.

To resolve, let's list the neighbors of 1 from the snippet.

From the spiral and the numbers, likely the neighbors are: east:2, northeast:3? but 3 is at (1,1), northwest:4 at (0,1)? but (0,1) is north, not northwest.

From the path, when it spirals, but for the final grid, for cell 1, its neighbors are the cells that are adjacent in the grid, not in the path.

From the values, cell 1 is surrounded by 2,5,6,7, and also 3 and 4 are close, but in the grid, cell 3 at (1,1) is adjacent to 1? distance as calculated 2, so not.

In the snippet, cell 1 is at center, cell 2 is to its right, cell 5 to its left, cell 6 below it, cell 7 below-right, and cell 4 above it? in "4" is directly above 1 in the display, so likely adjacent.

In the display, "4" is above "1", "5" is left of "1", "2" right, "6" below, and "3" is above and right of "1", "7" below and right.

But in a standard display, if it's a hex grid, cell directly above is cell 4, then cell 3 is northeast, cell 7 is southeast, etc.

And cell 1 is adjacent to 2,4,5,6, and also to 3 and 7? but cell 3 is at (1,1), cell 7 at (1,-1), and cell 1 at (0,0), and if we consider the grid, cell (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0):2, (0,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, and also to (1,1):3? and to (1,-1):7? but then it would have 6 neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

And in the grid, at (1,1):3, (1,-1):7, so yes, and (-1,1):14 is not adjacent, distance 2.

So in this grid, cell (x,y) is adjacent to (x±1,y), (x,y±1), and (x±1,y±1)? but that would be 8 directions.

Specifically, for (0,0), it is adjacent to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)? 8 cells.

But in the snippet, at (-1,1):14, at (-1,-1):16, at (1,1):3, at (1,-1):7, so all are present, and for cell 1, it might be adjacent to all, but that would be 8 neighbors, but hexagonal grid should have 6.

Perhaps only 6 of them are adjacent.

In particular, for cell (0,0), it is not adjacent to (-1,1) or (-1,-1), only to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (1,-1).

So the diagonal in one direction.

In other words, it is adjacent to cells where |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, and dx and dy same sign or something.

For (0,0) to (1,1): dx=1, dy=1, both positive.

To (1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1, different signs.

But in our case, it is adjacent to both (1,1) and (1,-1).

Perhaps it is a square grid with all 8-adjacency, but then it's not hexagonal.

Perhaps for this problem, the grid is such that each cell has six neighbors: the four orthogonal and two diagonal, but that is not regular.

To make progress, from the ring calculation earlier, even though the distance might not match, the ring number is defined by the spiral, not by geometric distance.

In the spiral, ring n has 6n cells for n>=1, with first number 3n(n-1)+2, last number 3n(n+1)+1.

For m=2026, we found n=26, F(n)=1952, k=2026-1952+1=75.

Ring 26 has 6*26=156 cells.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with 26 cells, since 6*26=156.

The sides are in order: say, east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, or something.

The first cell of the ring is at a certain position.

For example, for ring 1: first cell is at (1,0):2, which is east of center.

Then it goes to the next cell in the ring, which is (1,1):3, which is northeast of (1,0), so probably it is going in the northeast direction.

From (1,0) to (1,1): dy=1, dx=0, so north, not northeast.

From (1,0) to (1,1): if y is vertical, then from (x,y)=(1,0) to (1,1), so same x, y+1, so north.

Then from (1,1) to (0,1): x-1, y same, so west.

Then from (0,1) to where? for ring 1, next should be 5 at (-1,0), but from (0,1) to (-1,0): x-1, y-1, so southwest.

Then to 6 at (0,-1): x+1, y-1, southeast? from (-1,0) to (0,-1): dx=1, dy= -1.

Then to 7 at (1,-1): dx=1, dy=0, east? or southeast.

Let's list the cells for ring 1 in order:

1. (1,0):2

2. (1,1):3

3. (0,1):4

4. (-1,0):5  -- from (0,1) to (-1,0): dx= -1, dy= -1

5. (0,-1):6  -- from (-1,0) to (0,-1): dx=1, dy= -1

6. (1,-1):7  -- from (0,-1) to (1,-1): dx=1, dy=0

So the directions: from start: to cell 2: from (1,0) to (1,1): north

 to cell 3: to (0,1): west

 to cell 4: to (-1,0): southwest (dx-1, dy-1)

 to cell 5: to (0,-1): southeast (dx+1, dy-1)

 to cell 6: to (1,-1): east (dx+1, dy=0)

Then back to start, but it's a ring, so after 6 cells, it closes, but in this case, from (1,-1) back to (1,0) is north, but (1,0) is already occupied, so for the next ring, it starts from there.

For each side, it moves in a constant direction for n cells.

For ring n, it has 6 sides, each with n cells, and for each side, it moves in a fixed direction for n steps.

For example, in ring 1, n=1, each "side" has 1 cell, so it changes direction after each cell.

For ring 2, n=2, 12 cells, each side has 2 cells in the same direction.

From the end of ring 1, which is (1,-1):7, the next cell for ring 2 is at (2,-1):8, which is east of (1,-1)? from (1,-1) to (2,-1): dx=1, dy=0, east.

Then next cell: in snippet, after 8 is 9 at (2,0), which is north of (2,-1): dx=0, dy=1.

Then 10 at (2,1): north again? dx=0, dy=1, so from (2,0) to (2,1): north.

But for a side of 2 cells, it should move in the same direction for 2 cells.

From (2,-1) to (2,0): that's one step north, then to (2,1): another step north, so yes, for the first side, it moves north for 2 cells: from (2,-1) to (2,0) to (2,1).

Then next cell: after 10 at (2,1), next is 11? not in snippet, but likely to (1,2) or (2,2), but probably to (1,2) or west.

In general, after moving in one direction for n cells, it turns 60 degrees counter-clockwise or clockwise.

In this case, from moving north, it should turn to northwest or northeast.

From (2,1), if it turns left (counter-clockwise), from north, left would be northwest, so to (1,2) or (1,1), but (1,1) is occupied.

So to (1,2): dx= -1, dy=1, northwest.

Then next cell in that direction, to (0,2) or (0,3), but likely to (0,2): dx= -1, dy=1 again? from (1,2) to (0,2): dx= -1, dy=0, not the same.

For the second side, it should move in the same direction for n=2 cells.

So from (2,1), after the first side ended at (2,1), it turns to the next direction.

From north, if it turns 60 degrees counter-clockwise, to northwest, which is dx= -1, dy=1.

So move to (2-1,1+1)=(1,2) for cell 11.

Then move again in same direction to (1-1,2+1)=(0,3)? or to (0,2)? the direction northwest is (-1,1), so from (1,2) to (1-1,2+1)=(0,3).

Then next cell.

But in our grid, at (0,2) might be 12, at (0,3) might be later.

From the first cell of ring 2: (2,-1):8

Then move north to (2,0):9

Then move north to (2,1):10

Then turn left to northwest, to (1,2):11

Then to (0,3):12? but then it might not match.

Perhaps after (2,1), it moves west to (1,1), but occupied.

Another possibility: the turn is not at the end, but the side includes the turn.

For ring n, the first cell is at a corner, then it moves in a direction for n cells, but the first cell is at the start of the side.

In ring 1, each cell is a "corner".

For ring 2, it starts at (2,-1):8, then moves in the "northeast" direction or something.

From (2,-1) to (2,0): this is north, dy=1, dx=0.

Then from (2,0) to (2,1): again north, so for the first side, it moves north for 2 cells: to (2,0) and (2,1).

Then at (2,1), it turns to the next direction. If counter-clockwise, from north to northwest, so to (1,2) or (1,1), but (1,1) occupied, so to (1,2):11.

Then for the second side, move northwest for 2 cells: to (1,2) and then to (0,3):12.

Then at (0,3), turn left to west, so to (-1,3):13.

Then move west for 2 cells: to (-1,3) and (-2,3):14, but in our grid, at (-1,1) is 14, not at (-2,3).

So not matching.

Perhaps it turns 60 degrees clockwise.

From (2,1), after moving north, turn clockwise to northeast, but northeast from (2,1) is to (3,2) or (3,1), not to existing cells.

Perhaps the direction is not Cartesian, but along the hex directions.

Perhaps in cube coordinates, the directions are defined.

To simplify, for the ring, the cells are added in order around the ring, and for a given k, we can find the coordinates.

For ring n, the first cell is at (n, -n+1) or something.

For n=1: first cell at (1,0)

For n=2: first cell at (2,-1)

For n=3: probably at (3,-2) or (3,-1)

In general, it might be at (n, 1-n) or (n, -n)

For n=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

For n=2: (2,-1) = (2,1-2)? 1-2= -1, yes.

So first cell at (n, 1-n)

Then it moves in the six directions in order.

From there, it moves in the direction of (0,1) for n cells? for n=2, from (2,-1) move north: to (2,0), (2,1), but for n=2, it should move for 2 cells, so to (2,0) and (2,1), but (2,1) is the third cell, but for the first side, it should have n cells, including the first or not.

In ring n, there are 6n cells, with 6 sides, each side has n cells.

The first cell of the ring is the first cell of the first side.

For the first side, it moves in a certain direction for n steps, but since it's discrete, for n cells in that direction, but the first cell is at the start, so it moves n-1 steps to the end of the side.

For example, in ring 2, n=2, first cell at (2,-1):8

Then move in direction (0,1) (north) for 1 step to (2,0):9, so after 1 step, at cell 2 of the side.

Then for the next side, it turns 60 degrees counter-clockwise, to direction (-1,1) or something.

From north (0,1), counter-clockwise might be to northwest, which is (-1,1) in our coordinate, since from (2,0) to (1,1): dx= -1, dy=1, so vector (-1,1).

So move in direction (-1,1) for n=2 cells: from (2,0) to next cell: (2-1,0+1)=(1,1), but (1,1) is already occupied by 3, so cannot.

Perhaps the turn is at the cell, and it moves to the next cell in the new direction.

From (2,-1) move north to (2,0): cell 2 of ring (k=2)

Then from (2,0), turn counter-clockwise to northwest, so move to (2-1,0+1)=(1,1), but occupied, so not.

Perhaps it turns after the side is complete.

For the first side, it occupies cells from (2,-1) to (2,1) by moving north, but (2,1) is cell 3 of the ring.

Then at (2,1), it is the end of the first side, then it turns to the next direction, say northwest, and moves to (1,2) for cell 4.

Then to (0,3) for cell 5, etc.

But as before, may not match the number at ( -1,1):14.

Perhaps for ring 2, the cells are: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(2,1), 11:(1,2), 12:(0,2), 13:(-1,2), 14:(-1,1), 15:(-1,0), 16:(-1,-1), 17:(0,-1), 18:(1,-1), 19:(2,-1) but (2,-1) is already 8, so not.

 (0,-1) is already 6, occupied.

So not.

Perhaps it moves in different directions.

Another idea: in some hexagonal spirals, the first cell of ring n is at (n,0) or (0,n), but in our case for n=1: (1,0), n=2: (2,-1), not (2,0).

 (2,0) is 9, which is not first.

Perhaps (n, -n+1) as before.

Then the directions are: first move in direction (0,1) for n cells: but for n=2, from (2,-1) move north: to (2,0), (2,1), so cells at (2,-1), (2,0), (2,1), but that's 3 cells, but n=2, should be 2 cells for the side.

So perhaps the side has n cells, so it moves n-1 steps in the direction.

For side 1: cells at (n,1-n), (n,2-n), ..., (n,0) if n>1, but for n=2, (2,-1), (2,0), so two cells.

Then at (2,0), it is the end, then for side 2, move in a new direction.

From (2,0), if it turns 60 degrees counter-clockwise from north, to northwest, vector (-1,1), so move to (2-1,0+1)=(1,1), but occupied.

So perhaps the direction is not in Cartesian, but in hex directions.

Define the six directions as vectors: let's say D1 = (1,0)  // east
 D2 = (0,1)  // north? but in hex, not.
In cube coordinates, the six directions are: (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1) or something.

To match, from (0,0), neighbors at (1,0), (0,1), etc, but in our case, the vectors are (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1), as we had for distance 1.

For the spiral path in the ring, it moves in these directions.

For ring n, it starts at a cell, and then moves in a sequence of directions for n steps each.

For example, for ring 1: starts at (1,0) for cell 2.

Then it needs to add 5 more cells.

From (1,0), it can move in different directions to new cells.

In the path, it moved to (1,1) for 3, which is vector (0,1), so north.

Then to (0,1) for 4, vector (-1,0), west.

Then to (-1,0) for 5, vector (0,-1), south? from (0,1) to (-1,0): vector (-1,-1), which is southwest.

Then to (0,-1) for 6, vector (1,-1), southeast.

Then to (1,-1) for 7, vector (1,0), east.

So the directions used: from start: to cell 2: already at (1,0), then to cell 3: vector (0,1)  // north
 to cell 4: vector (-1,0) // west
 to cell 5: vector (-1,-1) // southwest
 to cell 6: vector (1,-1) // southeast
 to cell 7: vector (1,0) // east

So not constant.

For the ring, the sides are between the corners.

For ring n, there are 6 corners, at (n,0), (0,n), (-n,0), (0,-n), (n,-n), (-n,n) or something.

For n=1: cells at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1), but in our grid, (-1,1) is not in ring 1.

In our case, for ring 1, corners might be (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), and the sixth is missing, but we have only 6 cells.

Perhaps the corners are at (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), but (1,1) is at distance 2.

I think for this grid, the "corner" cells are those with max |x| or |y|, but for ring 1, all cells have |x| + |y| =1 or 2, but not constant.

To solve the problem, I am for the number 2026 in ring 26, position k=75 in the ring.

The ring has 6 sides, each with 26 cells.

So the side length s=26.

The index k from 1 to 156.

The side number can be found by floor((k-1)/s) = floor((k-1)/26)

For k=75, floor((75-1)/26) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) =2, so side 2 (0-based or 1-based?).

 floor((k-1)/s) gives the side index, usually 0 to 5.

For k=1, floor(0/26)=0, side 0.

k=26, floor(25/26)=0, still side 0.

k=27, floor(26/26)=1, side 1.

k=52, floor(51/26)=1.96, floor=1, side 1.

k=53, floor(52/26)=2, side 2.

k=78, floor(77/26)=2.96, floor=2, side 2.

k=79, floor(78/26)=3, side 3.

For k=75, floor((75-1)/26)= floor(74/26)= floor(2.846)=2, so side 2 (0-based).

So sides 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Each side has s=26 cells.

The position within the side is r = (k-1) mod s +1 = (k-1) mod 26 +1

For k=75, (75-1) mod 26 = 74 mod 26.

26*2=52, 74-52=22, so r=22+1=23? or r=22 for 0-based.

Usually, the position in the side is from 0 to s-1 or 1 to s.

Let r = (k-1) mod s

Then r=0 to s-1.

For k=75, r=74 mod 26 = 22 (since 26*2=52, 74-52=22), so r=22.

So in side 2, position 22 (0-based, so the 23rd cell in the side).

Now, the starting point of the ring is at (n, 1-n) = (26, 1-26) = (26, -25)

Then for each side, it moves in a certain direction for each cell in the side.

The directions for the sides are in order: for side 0: move in direction D0
 side 1: D1
 etc.

From the first cell, for side 0, it moves in D0 for r steps, but since it's the first cell, for r=0, it is at the start, for r=1, it has moved one step in D0, etc.

For example, for ring 1: n=1, start at (1,0)

Side 0: r=0: cell at (1,0):2

Then for side 1: r=0: should be the first cell of side 1, which is cell k=2: (1,1):3

From (1,0) to (1,1): vector (0,1), so D0 = (0,1)? but for side 0, it is at r=0, not moved.

Perhaps for each side, the direction is constant, and the cell is at start + r * direction.

For side 0: cells at start + r * D0 for r=0 to s-1.

For ring 1, s=1, so only r=0: at (1,0)

For side 1: cells at some point + r * D1 for r=0 to 0.

What is the start of side 1? It should be (1,1)

From (1,0) to (1,1): vector (0,1), so if D0 = (0,1), then for side 0, at (1,0) + r*(0,1), for r=0: (1,0), good.

For side 1, it should start at the end of side 0, which is (1,0) + (s-1)*D0 = (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0), but it should be (1,1), not the same.

Perhaps the start of side i is the end of side i-1, and for side i, cells at start_i + r * D_i for r=0 to s-1.

For side 0: start0 = (n,1-n) = (1,0)

 D0 = say (0,1)

 then cells: for r=0: (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0)

 end of side 0: (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0) for s=1

 then start of side 1 = end of side 0 = (1,0)

 D1 = say (-1,0) or something.

But for cell 3 at (1,1), so not.

Perhaps D_i is the direction to move, and start_i is the first cell.

For side 0: start0 = (1,0), D0 = (0,1), so for r=0: (1,0), for r=1: (1,1), but for s=1, only r=0, so only (1,0)

Then side 1: start1 = (1,1), D1 = (-1,0), so for r=0: (1,1), good for cell 3.

Then for side 2: start2 = end of side 1 = (1,1) + (s-1)*D1 = (1,1) +0*(-1,0)=(1,1), but cell 4 is at (0,1), so start2 = (0,1), D2 = (0,-1) or something.

From (1,1) to (0,1): vector (-1,0), same as D1, but for side 2, it should be a new direction.

Perhaps the directions are different.

For the first side, D0 = (0,1) // north
 then after, it turns 60 degrees.

From north, turn left (ccw) to northwest, which is (-1,1) in our coordinate.

So D1 = (-1,1)

Then for side 1: cells at start1 + r * D1 for r=0 to s-1.

For ring 1, s=1, start1 = end of side 0 = (1,0) + (s-1)*D0 = (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0)

Then for r=0: (1,0) +0*(-1,1)=(1,0), but should be (1,1) for cell 3, not match.

Perhaps start1 is start0 + D0 for the first cell of side 1, but for s>1, it might be different.

For ring n, the first cell of side i is at a specific location.

Perhaps the corners are at fixed relative positions.

After some search in my memory, for a hexagonal spiral, the coordinates can be given by:

For a number m, find ring n as before.

Then the first cell is at (n, 1-n)

Then the side 0: move in direction (0,1) for n cells: so cells at (n, 1-n + r) for r=0 to n-1

For n=1: r=0: (1,1-1+0)=(1,0), good.

For n=2: r=0: (2,1-2+0)=(2,-1), r=1: (2,1-2+1)=(2,0), so cells 8 and 9, good.

Then at the end of side 0: (2,0) for n=2.

Then side 1: move in direction (-1,1) for n cells.

Direction (-1,1), so cells at (2 + r*(-1), 0 + r*1) for r=0 to n-1

For r=0: (2,0), r=1: (2-1,0+1)=(1,1)

But for n=2, cells should be 10 and 11, but in grid at (1,1) is 3, occupied, and 10 is at (2,1), not (1,1).

So not.

Perhaps direction (-1,0) for side 1.

For r=0: (2,0), r=1: (2-1,0+0)=(1,0), occupied.

Not.

Perhaps for side 1, it moves in direction that is 60 degrees from previous.

From the end of side 0: (2,0) for n=2, previous direction was (0,1) (north), so if turn left, to northwest, vector (-1,1), as before.

But (2,0) + (-1,1) = (1,1), occupied.

So for n>1, it may be different, or for this grid, it turns right instead.

Try turn right (clockwise).

From north, turn right to northeast, vector (1,1)

So for side 1: cells at (2,0) + r*(1,1) for r=0 to 1

r=0: (2,0), r=1: (2+1,0+1)=(3,1)

Then cell 10 at (3,1), but in our grid for ring 2, at (2,1) is 10, not (3,1).

So not.

Perhaps the direction is not for each step, but the cell is at a formula.

Perhaps for side i, the cells are at (n - min(i,1) * something, but it's messy.

Another idea: in some implementations, for side i, the direction is given by i, and the cell is at start + r * dir_i.

For side 0: dir0 = (0,1) // north

 side 1: dir1 = (-1,0) // west
 side 2: dir2 = (0,-1) // south
 side 3: dir3 = (1,-1) // southeast
 side 4: dir4 = (1,0) // east
 side 5: dir5 = (0,1) // north, but then for next ring.

For ring 1: side 0: r=0: (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0):2

 side 1: start1 = end of side 0 = (1,0) +0*(0,1)=(1,0) for s=1, but should be (1,1) for cell 3, not.

Unless for side i, start_i = start_{i-1} + (s) * dir_{i-1} , but for s=1, start1 = (1,0) +1*(0,1)=(1,1), good.

Then for side 1: cells at (1,1) + r * dir1 = (1,1) + r*(-1,0) for r=0 to 0: (1,1):3, good.

Then start2 = start1 + s * dir1 = (1,1) +1*(-1,0)=(0,1)

 side 2: cells at (0,1) + r * dir2 = (0,1) + r*(0,-1) for r=0 to 0: (0,1):4, good.

Then start3 = (0,1) +1*(0,-1)=(0,0), but occupied, and cell 5 is at (-1,0), not (0,0).

So not.

For side 2: dir2 = (0,-1), but from (0,1) to (0,0), but (0,0) occupied, so should go to (-1,0).

So perhaps dir2 = (-1,-1) or something.

From (0,1) to (-1,0): vector (-1,-1), so dir2 = (-1,-1)

Then for r=0: (0,1) +0*(-1,-1)=(0,1):4

 r=1: (0-1,1-1)=(-1,0):5, good for n=1, s=1, r=0 only, so only (0,1).

For n=1, it works with dir0=(0,1), dir1=(-1,0), dir2=(-1,-1)? for side 2: start2 = (0,1), r=0: (0,1):4, good.

Then start3 = start2 + s * dir2 = (0,1) +1*(-1,-1)=(-1,0)

 side 3: cells at (-1,0) + r * dir3, for cell 6 at (0,-1), so from (-1,0) to (0,-1): vector (1,-1), so dir3 = (1,-1)

 r=0: (-1,0):5, good.

Then start4 = (-1,0) +1*(1,-1)=(0,-1)

 side 4: cells at (0,-1) + r * dir4, cell 7 at (1,-1), vector (1,0), so dir4 = (1,0)
 r=0: (0,-1):6, good.

Then start5 = (0,-1) +1*(1,0)=(1,-1)

 side 5: cells at (1,-1) + r * dir5, for cell 8 or back, but for ring 1, only 6 cells, so done.

For ring 2, s=2, start0 = (2,1-2)=(2,-1)

 dir0 = (0,1) // same as before

 cells for r=0 to 1: (2,-1) + r*(0,1) = (2,-1), (2,0) so cells 8 and 9, good.

Then start1 = start0 + s * dir0 = (2,-1) +2*(0,1)=(2,1)

 side 1: cells at (2,1) + r * dir1 = (2,1) + r* (-1,0) for r=0 to 1: (2,1), (1,1)

But (1,1) is already occupied by 3, and in grid, cell 10 is at (2,1), cell 11 should be at (1,2) or something, not (1,1).

So conflict.

Perhaps the directions are different for each ring, or the turn is fixed.

Perhaps for all rings, the directions are the same sequence: D0 = (0,1), D1 = (-1,0), D2 = (0,-1), D3 = (1,-1), D4 = (1,0), D5 = (0,1) but then for side 5, same as side 0, not good.

Or D5 = (-1,1) or something.

Let's list the directions used in ring 1:
From cell 2 to 3: (0,1) north
 cell 3 to 4: (-1,0) west
 cell 4 to 5: (-1,-1) southwest
 cell 5 to 6: (1,-1) southeast
 cell 6 to 7: (1,0) east

So the directions between cells: north, west, sw, se, east.

For the cells in the side, the direction of the side is the direction in which it is moving during that side.

For ring n, side i has cells moving in a constant direction.

For side i, the direction D_i is fixed for all rings.

From ring 1, for side 0: cells 2 to 3? but in ring 1, each "side" has only one cell, so the direction might be defined by the edge.

Perhaps for the cell itself, the position can be given by the side and the index.

For the first cell of the ring, at (n, 1-n)

Then for side 0: cells at (n, 1-n + r) for r=0 to n-1  // moving north

For side 1: cells at (n - r, 1-n + n) = (n - r, 1) for r=0 to n-1  // moving west, but y=1, for n=2, (2-0,1)=(2,1), (2-1,1)=(1,1), but (1,1) occupied.

So not.

For side 1: cells at (n - r, n) or something.

Assume that for side 0: y- coordinate increases from 1-n to 0, x= n

For side 1: x- coordinate decreases from n to 0, y=0 or something.

For n=2, side 0: r=0: (2,-1), r=1: (2,0)

Then side 1: cells at (2 - r, 0) for r=0 to 1: (2,0), (1,0) but (1,0) occupied.

Not.

Perhaps y is constant for side 1.

From the end of side 0: (2,0) for n=2, then for side 1, it should move west, so cells at (2 - r, 0) for r=0,1, but (1,0) occupied.

So perhaps it moves to (2,1) for the next, but then not west.

I think for this particular spiral, in the given snippet, for ring 2, after (2,-1):8, (2,0):9, then next is (2,1):10, then (1,2):11, then (0,2):12, then (-1,2):13, then (-1,1):14, then (-1,0):15, then (-1,-1):16, then (0,-1):17, but (0,-1) is occupied by 6, so not.

Perhaps (0,-2):17, etc.

But in our grid, at (0,-1) is 6, already in ring 1, so for ring 2, it should be at distance 2, so (0,-1) is already occupied, so cells like (2,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,-1) but (2,-1) is already 8, and ( -1,0) is 5, occupied.

So to avoid occupation, the cells for ring 2 are those not in ring 0 or 1, at distance 2 from center.

In cube distance, cells with distance 2: |x| + |y| + |s| =4, with s= -x-y.

Cells like (2,0): |2|+|0|+|2|=4, distance 2
 (0,2):0+2+2=4, dist 2
 (-2,0):2+0+2=4, dist 2
 (0,-2):0+2+2=4, dist 2
 (2,-2):2+2+0=4, dist 2
 (-2,2):2+2+0=4, dist 2
 (1,1):1+1+2=4, dist 2
 (1,-1):1+1+0=2, dist 1, already in ring 1
 ( -1,1):1+1+0=2, dist 1, in ring 1
 ( -1,-1):1+1+0=2, dist 1, in ring 1
 (2,1):2+1+3=6, dist 3? |2| + |1| + |2+1|=2+1+3=6, dist 3
For (2,0): |2| + |0| + |2+0|=2+0+2=4, dist 2
 (1,1): |1| + |1| + |1+1|=1+1+2=4, dist 2
 (0,2):0+2+2=4, dist 2
 (-1,1):1+1+0=2, dist 1
So for distance 2: cells with |x| + |y| + |x+y| =4.

Cells: (2,0), (0,2), (-2,0), (0,-2), (2,-2), (-2,2), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), but (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + |1-1|=1+1+0=2, dist 1, already in ring 1.

So only the cells where |x| + |y| + |x+y| =4, and not in ring 1, so (2,0), (0,2), (-2,0), (0,-2), (2,-2), (-2,2), (1,1), and also ( -1, -1) is dist 1, (2,1): |2| + |1| + |3|=2+1+3=6, dist 3.

Additional cells: ( -1,2): | -1| + |2| + |1| =1+2+1=4, dist 2
 (2,-1): |2| + |-1| + |1|=2+1+1=4, dist 2
 ( -2,1):2+1+1=4, dist 2
 (1,-2):1+2+1=4, dist 2
 ( -1,-2):1+2+1=4, dist 2
 etc.

So many cells, 12 in total for ring 2.

In the spiral, it starts at (2,-1):8, then (2,0):9, then (2,1):10? but (2,1): |2| + |1| + |3|=6, dist 3, not in ring 2.

For (2,0): dist 2, (2,-1): dist 2, then (1,0): dist 1, occupied, so next might be (1,1): dist 2, |1| + |1| + |2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2, so (1,1):10, then (0,1): dist 1, occupied, so (0,2): dist 2, |0| + |2| + |2|=0+2+2=4, dist 2, so (0,2):11, then (-1,2): | -1| + |2| + |1|=1+2+1=4, dist 2, (-1,2):12, then (-1,1): dist 1, occupied, so (-1,0): dist 1, occupied, so (-2,0): | -2| + |0| + | -2|=2+0+2=4, dist 2, (-2,0):13, then (-2,1): | -2| + |1| + | -1|=2+1+1=4, dist 2, (-2,1):14, but in our grid at (-1,1) is 14, not (-2,1).

In our grid, at (-2,0) is 15, at (-1,1) is 14, etc.

So perhaps the spiral is different.

Perhaps for this problem, I can assume that the neighbors of a number can be found by its position, but for 2026, I need its neighbors, so perhaps the sum is the same for all cells in the same ring or something, but unlikely.

Perhaps the neighbors are at distance 1 in the grid, and for a cell in ring n, its neighbors could be in ring n-1, n, or n+1.

For a cell on the boundary of ring n, it may have neighbors in n-1 and n+1.

For example, cell 2 at (1,0) in ring 1, neighbors: (2,0):9 in ring 2, (1,1):3 in ring 1, (0,0):1 in ring 0, (1,-1):7 in ring 1, (2,-1):8 in ring 2, (0,1):4 in ring 1, etc.

So mixed rings.

To find the sum for 2026, I need its six neighbors, which are at the six adjacent cells, and their numbers depend on when they are filled.

Perhaps I can find the coordinates of 2026, then find the coordinates of its neighbors, then find the numbers at those coordinates.

For that, I need the coordinate as a function of the number.

From earlier, for a number m, in ring n, with index k in the ring.

For ring n, first cell at (n, 1-n) with number F(n) = 3n(n-1)+2

Then for the cell at index k, it is on side floor((k-1)/n) , but since each side has n cells, floor((k-1)/n) gives the side index, from 0 to 5.

For k=1, floor(0/n)=0, side 0.

For k=n, floor((n-1)/n)=0, side 0.

For k=n+1, floor(n/n)=1, side 1.

For k=2n, floor((2n-1)/n)= floor(2-1/n)=1, side 1.

For k=2n+1, floor(2n/n)=2, side 2, and so on.

Then on side i, the position r = (k-1) mod n

Then the cell is at a location based on i and r.

For example, for side 0: i=0, cells at (n, 1-n + r) for r=0 to n-1

For side 1: i=1, cells at (n - r, 1) for r=0 to n-1, but for n>1, y=1, but for different n, y should be different.

For side i, the cell is at ( n - min(i,6-i) * r or something.

Perhaps the coordinate is:

For side 0: (n, 1-n + r)

For side 1: (n - r, 1-n + n) = (n - r, 1)  // since moved n steps in y-direction in side 0

For side 2: (n - n, 1 - r) = (0, 1 - r)  // moved n steps in x-direction in side 1

For side 3: (0 - r, 1 - n) = (-r, 1-n)  // moved n steps in y-direction down in side 2

For side 4: (-n + r, 1-n - 0) but not.

Let's try for n=2.

Side 0: r=0: (2,1-2+0)=(2,-1)
 r=1: (2,1-2+1)=(2,0)

Side 1: cells at (2 - r, 1) for r=0: (2,1), r=1: (1,1)

But (1,1) is occupied, and for cell 10, it should be at (2,1) or (1,2).

If (2,1):10, then good, but (1,1) is 3, not in ring 2.

For side 1, perhaps (n - r, n) or (n - r, r) etc.

Assume that for side 1: cells at (n - r, n) for r=0 to n-1

For n=2: r=0: (2,2), r=1: (1,2)

Then cell 10 at (2,2)? cell 11 at (1,2)

Then side 2: cells at (1 - r, 2 - s) or something.

Then cell 12 at (0,2) or etc.

In the grid, if (2,2):10, (1,2):11, then next side might be cells at (0,2), (0,1) but occupied.

Perhaps after (1,2), to (0,2):12, then to (-1,2):13, etc.

For n=2, cells: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(2,2)? but (2,0) is 9, (2,2) is different cell.

In the grid, cell (2,2) is not listed, but if it is, number 10.

Then 11:(1,2), 12:(0,2), 13:(-1,2), 14:(-2,2), 15:(-2,1), 16:(-2,0), 17:(-2,-1), 18:(-1,-1), 19:(0,-1), but (0,-1) occupied, 20:(1,-1), occupied, 21:(2,-1), already 8, so not.

So not good.

Perhaps for side 1: cells at (n, n - r) or something.

I think I need to accept the initial distance calculation and proceed with the ring and position.

For 2026, n=26, k=75, s=26, side i = floor((k-1)/s) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) =2 (0-based)

 r = (k-1) mod s = 74 mod 26 = 22 (0-based)

Now, the first cell of the ring at (26, 1-26) = (26, -25)

Then for side 0: cells at (26, -25 + r) for r=0 to 25

So for r=0: (26,-25), r=1: (26,-24), ..., r=25: (26,0)

Then end of side 0: (26,0)

Then for side 1: cells at (26 - r, 0) for r=0 to 25? but that would be (26,0), (25,0), (24,0), ..., (1,0), but many are occupied.

So not.

Perhaps for side 1: cells at (26 - r, r) or something.

Assume that the direction for side i is D_i, with D0 = (0,1), D1 = (-1,0), D2 = (0,-1), D3 = (1,-1), D4 = (1,0), D5 = (0,1) but then for side 5, same as side 0, not good for next ring.

Or D5 = (-1,1) or something.

Let's define the directions as:
 D0 = (0,1)  // north
 D1 = (-1,1) // northwest
 D2 = (-1,0) // west
 D3 = (0,-1) // south
 D4 = (1,-1) // southeast
 D5 = (1,0)  // east

Then for each side, the cell is at start_i + r * D_i

For ring n, start0 = (n, 1-n)

For side 0: cells at (n, 1-n) + r * (0,1) for r=0 to n-1: (n, 1-n + r)

End of side 0: (n, 1-n + (n-1)) = (n, 0)

Then start1 = end of side 0 = (n, 0)

For side 1: cells at (n, 0) + r * (-1,1) for r=0 to n-1: (n - r, 0 + r) = (n - r, r)

End of side 1: (n - (n-1), 0 + (n-1)) = (1, n-1)

Then start2 = (1, n-1)

For side 2: cells at (1, n-1) + r * (-1,0) for r=0 to n-1: (1 - r, n-1)

End of side 2: (1 - (n-1), n-1) = (2-n, n-1)

Then start3 = (2-n, n-1)

For side 3: cells at (2-n, n-1) + r * (0,-1) for r=0 to n-1: (2-n, n-1 - r)

End of side 3: (2-n, n-1 - (n-1)) = (2-n, 0)

Then start4 = (2-n, 0)

For side 4: cells at (2-n, 0) + r * (1,-1) for r=0 to n-1: (2-n + r, 0 - r) = (2-n + r, -r)

End of side 4: (2-n + (n-1), - (n-1)) = (1, 1-n)

Then start5 = (1, 1-n)

For side 5: cells at (1, 1-n) + r * (1,0) for r=0 to n-1: (1 + r, 1-n)

End of side 5: (1 + (n-1), 1-n) = (n, 1-n) which is the start of the ring, good for closing.

Now for n=1:
 start0 = (1,0)
 side 0: r=0: (1,0):2
 end0 = (1,0)
 start1 = (1,0)
 side 1: r=0: (1 -0, 0+0)=(1,0), but should be cell 3 at (1,1), not the same cell.

For r=0: (n - r, r) = (1-0,0)=(1,0), same as previous.

So for n=1, it doesn't work because s=1, and it overlaps.

For n>1, it might work.

For n=2:
 start0 = (2,-1)
 side 0: r=0: (2,-1):8
 r=1: (2,-1+1)=(2,0):9
 end0 = (2,0)
 start1 = (2,0)
 side 1: r=0: (2-0, 0+0)=(2,0):9, same as end0, so cell 9 is shared, but in ring, each cell is unique, so it should be different cells.

For r=0: (2,0), which is already cell 9, then r=1: (2-1,0+1)=(1,1): should be cell 10, but in grid, (1,1) is 3, occupied, and for ring 2, it should be a new cell.

So still problem.

Perhaps for side i, r starts from 1 for i>0, but that would skip cells.

Perhaps the r for each side is from 0 to n-1, but for side i>0, it is offset.

Perhaps in the cell formula, for side i, the r is the index, but the formula has min or max.

For side 1: cells at (n - r, r) for r=1 to n, but then for n=2, r=1: (2-1,1)=(1,1), r=2: (2-2,2)=(0,2), so cells at (1,1) and (0,2), so 10 and 11.

Then in grid, if (1,1) is 10, but it is already 3, so conflict.

Unless the grid is not occupied by lower rings, but in this case, (1,1) is in ring 1, so for ring 2, it must be different cells.

So perhaps for this coordinate system, the cells for different rings are at different (x,y), but in our case, (1,1) is already taken.

So to make it work, we need to use a different coordinate system or accept that for this spiral, the coordinates are not on a lattice with all integers, but only some.

Perhaps the y-coordinate is not integer, but in the snippet, it is given as rows, so probably integer.

Perhaps for the spiral, the ring n has cells with max(|x|,|y|,|s|) = n or something.

In cube coordinates, distance is max(|x|,|y|,|z|), with x+y+z=0.

For cell at (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0, distance from origin is max(|x|,|y|,|z|).

For distance d, there are 6d cells for d>0.

For d=0:1 cell
 d=1:6 cells
 d=2:12 cells? 6*2=12, yes.
 d=3:18 cells, etc.

The last number for distance d is 1 + sum_{k=1}^d 6k = 1 + 6* d(d+1)/2 = 1 + 3d(d+1), same as before for ring n=d.

So same as before.

For a cell at distance d, its coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0, max(|x|,|y|,|z|) = d.

Then for given d and position in the ring, we can find (x,y,z).

For example, for d=1: cells with max(|x|,|y|,|z|)=1, and x+y+z=0.

Possible: (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,1,-1), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0)

In our grid, at (1,0): which might be (1,0,-1), at (0,1): (0,1,-1), at (-1,0): (-1,0,1), at (0,-1): (0,-1,1), at (1,-1): (1,-1,0), at (-1,1): (-1,1,0)

So all covered.

For the spiral, it starts at (1,0,-1):2, then to (1,-1,0):3? or to (0,1,-1):4, etc.

In our case, it went to (1,1,-2)? but max| | =2, not 1.

For distance 1, only those 6 cells.

In the path, from 1 at (0,0,0), to 2 at (1,0,-1), then to 3 at (1,-1,0), then to 4 at (0,-1,1), then to 5 at (-1,0,1), then to 6 at (-1,1,0), then to 7 at (0,1,-1), but in our grid, at (0,1,-1) is 4, not 7, and at (1,-1,0) is 7, etc.

So the order may be different.

For the position in the ring, we can assign an angle or something.

For the number 2026, in distance d=26, with index k=75 in the ring of 156 cells.

Then the cell can be found by its "sector" and offset.

Typically, the first cell of the ring is at (d, 0, -d) or (d, -d, 0), etc.

Usually, it is at (d, 0, -d)

Then it moves in the six directions in order.

For example, move in direction (0,-1,1) for d cells, but since it's discrete, etc.

I recall that in some resources, for a hexagonal lattice, the coordinates can be calculated.

Perhaps for this problem, since it's a regular grid, the sum of neighbors might be approximately 6 times the number or something, but not accurate.

Perhaps for a cell in the spiral, the neighbors are the cells adjacent in the grid, and for a given number, its neighbors have numbers close to it, but not always, as seen with 1 and 14.

For 2026, it is in ring 26, so its neighbors could be in ring 25, 26, or 27.

And since it is not on a corner, likely has two in ring 25, two in ring 26, two in ring 27, or something.

For example, for cell 2 in ring 1: neighbors: (2,0):9 in ring 2, (1,1):3 in ring 1, (0,0):1 in ring 0, (1,-1):7 in ring 1, (2,-1):8 in ring 2, (0,1):4 in ring 1.

So numbers: 9,3,1,7,8,4

Sum 9+3+1+7+8+4=32

Whereas 2 itself is 2.

For cell 9 in ring 2: at (2,0), neighbors: (3,0):20 in ring 3, (2,1):10 in ring 2, (1,0):2 in ring 1, (2,-1):8 in ring 2, (3,-1):19 in ring 3, (1,1):3 in ring 1.

So 20,10,2,8,19,3, sum 20+10+2+8+19+3=62

For cell 2026, if it is in the middle of a side, it might have a similar distribution.

But to be precise, I need the actual neighbors.

Perhaps the sum can be calculated based on the ring and position.

Perhaps for any cell, the sum of its six neighbors is 6 times the cell number plus or minus something, but from above, for cell 2, sum 32, 6*2=12, not close.

Or perhaps related to the ring.

Another idea: in many spirals, the neighbors' sum can be found by the formula involving the number.

Perhaps the grid is such that the number at (x,y) can be given by a formula, but it's complicated.

Perhaps for the hexagonal spiral, the number at (x,y) can be calculated, but it might be complex.

Perhaps for the number 2026, since it is large, and the grid is symmetric, the sum is approximately 6*2026, but from earlier, for cell 2, sum 32 > 12, for cell 9, sum 62 > 54, so larger.

For cell 1: neighbors 2,4,5,6,7,14, sum 2+4+5+6+7+14=38, while 6*1=6.

So varies.

Perhaps the sum is 6m + c for some constant c, but 38 for m=1, 32 for m=2, not constant.

Or perhaps c depends on ring.

For cell in ring n, sum of neighbors = 6* m + k*n or something.

For cell 1, n=0, sum 38
 cell 2, n=1, sum 32
 cell 9, n=2, sum 62
 not obvious.

Perhaps the sum is the same for all cells in the same "type" position.

But for this problem, since 2026 is given, and it is even, etc, but not helpful.

Perhaps I can find which cell is 2026 by its position.

From earlier, for ring n=26, first number 1952 at (26, -25) in some coordinate.

Then the cells are added in order.

The direction for the first side is north, so cells at (26, -25 + r) for r=0 to 25, so from (26,-25) to (26,0)

Numbers 1952 to 1952+25=1977 at (26,0)

Then for the next side, say northwest or something, to (25,1), etc.

But to avoid occupation, it should be to new cells.

In the formula with cube coordinates, let's try.

In cube coordinates, distance d=26, first cell at (d, 0, -d) = (26,0,-26)

Number 1952.

Then it moves in the direction of the next cell.

Typically, it might move in the direction ( -1,1,0) or (0,-1,1), etc.

The six directions are: (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)

Usually ordered.

Suppose it starts at (d,0,-d)

Then moves in direction (0,-1,1) for d cells? for d=1: from (1,0,-1) move in (0,-1,1) to (1+0,0-1,-1+1)=(1,-1,0), which is cell 3 in our earlier list.

Then from (1,-1,0) move in next direction, say (-1,0,1) to (1-1,-1+0,0+1)=(0,-1,1), cell 4, and so on.

For d=1, it works if the path is (1,0,-1):2, (1,-1,0):3, (0,-1,1):4, (-1,0,1):5, (-1,1,0):6, (0,1,-1):7

In our grid, at (0,1,-1) is 4, not 7, but in this sequence, it is 7, so different order, but the cell is the same.

For the number, it may be different, but for the neighbor sum, it might be the same since the grid is the same.

In this sequence, for cell (1,0,-1):2, neighbors are the six adjacent: (1+1,0+0,-1-1)=(2,0,-2), (1+0,0+0,-1-1)=(1,0,-2), but distance may not 1.

Neighbors of (1,0,-1): cells at (1±1,0, -1∓1), etc, but with x+y+z=0.

Standard neighbors: add the six vectors: (1,0,-1) + (1,-1,0) = (2,-1,-1), sum 0, distance max|2,1,1|=2, not 1.

The neighbors are at (x+dx,y+dy,z+dz) with (dx,dy,dz) one of the six directions, and x+y+z+dx+dy+dz=0+0=0, so still sum 0.

For (1,0,-1), neighbors:
 (1,0,-1) + (1,-1,0) = (2,-1,-1)
 (1,0,-1) + (1,0,-1) = (2,0,-2)
 (1,0,-1) + (0,1,-1) = (1,1,-2)
 (1,0,-1) + (-1,1,0) = (0,1,-1)
 (1,0,-1) + (-1,0,1) = (0,0,0)
 (1,0,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (1,-1,0)

So cells: (2,-1,-1), (2,0,-2), (1,1,-2), (0,1,-1), (0,0,0), (1,-1,0)

In our grid, at (0,0,0):1, (0,1,-1):4, (1,-1,0):7, (1,1,-2): not in ring 1, etc.

So the neighbors include cells in different rings.

For cell 2 at (1,0,-1), neighbors are: (2,-1,-1): distance max|2,1,1|=2, ring 2
 (2,0,-2): max|2,0,2|=2, ring 2
 (1,1,-2): max|1,1,2|=2, ring 2
 (0,1,-1): max|0,1,1|=1, ring 1
 (0,0,0):0, ring 0
 (1,-1,0): max|1,1,0|=1, ring 1

So numbers: for ring 0:1, ring 1:4 and 7, ring 2: cells at those coordinates, in our grid at (2,-1,-1): which is (2,-1, -1) s= -x-y= -2+1= -1, but in our earlier Cartesian, (x,y) = (2,-1), which is 8, (2,0,-2): (2,0), which is 9, (1,1,-2): (1,1), which is 3 in ring 1, but in this, it is at distance 2, but in our grid it is at distance 1, so conflict.

In this cube coordinate, cell (1,1,-2) has max|1,1,2|=2, distance 2, but in our grid, cell at (1,1) is at distance |1| + |1| + |2| =4/2=2 in our earlier calculation, so distance 2, so in ring 2, number for ring 2 is 8 to 19, and in our grid at (1,1) is 3, which is in ring 1, contradiction.

In our grid, for cell (1,1), in Cartesian (x,y)=(1,1), s= -x-y= -2, distance (|1| + |1| + | -2|)/2 = (1+1+2)/2=2, so should be in ring 2, but in the number spiral, it is number 3, which is in ring 1, since 2 to 7 are ring 1.

So inconsistency.

This means that in this grid, the numbering does not follow the geometric distance for the ring; the spiral ring n does not correspond to geometric distance n.

In the spiral, ring n has cells at various geometric distances.

For example, in ring 1, cells at distance 1, in ring 2, cells at distance 2, etc, but in our case, cell at (1,1) has distance 2, but is number 3, in ring 1, so not.

For cell (1,1): in our grid, number 3, which is in ring 1, but geometric distance 2.

Whereas cell ( -1,1): number 14, geometric distance 1, but in ring 2 or higher.

So for the spiral, the ring is based on the step in the spiral, not on the geometric distance.

For a given number, its geometric distance from center may vary, but for the neighbor sum, we need the grid positions.

To resolve, for the number 2026, in ring n=26, position k=75, we can assume a coordinate system and calculate.

Assume that the first cell of each ring is at (n, 0) in some system, but for n=1: (1,0), n=2: (2,-1), not (2,0).

So perhaps (n, -n+1) as before.

Then for the first side, it moves north to (n, -n+1 + r) for r=0 to n-1

For the second side, it moves northwest to (n - r, -n+1 + n + r) or something.

Perhaps after much trial, for the second side, it moves to (n - r, r) for r=0 to n-1, but with r starting from 0.

For n=2, side 0: r=0: (2,-1), r=1: (2,0)

Then side 1: r=0: (2 -0, 0 +0) wait.

Suppose for side 1: cells at (n - r, r) for r=0 to n-1

For n=2: r=0: (2,0), but already has cell at (2,0), so duplicate.

So perhaps r from 1 to n for side 1, but then for n=2, r=1: (2-1,1)=(1,1), r=2: (2-2,2)=(0,2)

Then cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (0,2)

Then side 2: cells at (0 - r, 2 - s) etc.

Then cell 12 at (-1,2), cell 13 at (-2,2), etc.

In the grid, if we have cells at (0,2), (-1,2), etc, and they are new, then it might work, and the number at (1,1) is 10 for ring 2, but in the snippet, it is 3, so different numbering, but for the problem, as long as the grid is hexagonal, the sum for the neighbors of 2026 might be the same regardless of the numbering order, but that doesn't make sense because the number at the neighbor cell depends on when it is filled.

For example, for cell 1, if the numbering is different, the neighbors may have different numbers.

So probably for this specific spiral, we need to use the given numbering.

Perhaps from the snippet, we can see the pattern for the directions.

From ring 1: cells in order: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7

So the sequence of directions from cell to cell: from2 to3: (0,1) north
3 to4: (-1,0) west
4 to5: (-1,-1) southwest
5 to6: (1,-1) southeast
6 to7: (1,0) east

Then from7 to8: in ring 2, from (1,-1) to (2,-1): (1,0) east, so same as previous.

Then from8 to9: (2,-1) to (2,0): (0,1) north
 then from9 to10: (2,0) to (2,1): (0,1) north again? but in snippet, after 9 is not given, but likely to (2,1) for 10, so (0,1) north.

Then from10 to11: (2,1) to (1,1)? but occupied, or to (1,2) for 11, so (-1,0) west or (-1,1) northwest.

In "10 ..." so not specified, but from the full spiral, usually it turns.

Assume that after placing the first cell of the ring, it moves in the same direction as the last move of the previous ring.

From cell 7 to 8: from (1,-1) to (2,-1): vector (1,0) east
 then from 8 to 9: (2,-1) to (2,0): vector (0,1) north
 then from 9 to 10: (2,0) to (2,1): vector (0,1) north
 then from 10 to 11: (2,1) to (1,2): vector (-1,1) northwest
 then to (0,2): vector (-1,0) west, etc.

For ring 2, cells: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(2,1), 11:(1,2), 12:(0,2), 13:(-1,2), 14:(-1,1), 15:(-1,0), 16:(-1,-1), 17:(0,-1), but (0,-1) occupied, so perhaps (0,-2):17, 18:(1,-2), 19:(2,-2), 20:(2,-1) but occupied, so not.

From (-1,2) to (-1,1): vector (0,-1) south, so 14 at (-1,1), then to (-1,0): vector (0,-1) south, 15 at (-1,0), but occupied, so conflict.

To avoid, after (-1,2):13, to (-2,2):14, then to (-2,1):15, etc.

In the grid, if no occupation, it works, and for the number, it is filled in that order, so for example at (1,1) is not filled in ring 1; in this numbering, cell 3 is at (1,1) for ring 1, but in this for ring 2, it would be cell 11 or something, so different.

For the problem, we have to use the given numbering from the snippet.

Perhaps for the number 2026, since it is in the ring, and if it is not on a corner, the sum can be calculated.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors is 6*2026 - 6 or something, but from earlier examples, not.

Let's calculate for cell 1: sum 2+4+5+6+7+14=38
 cell 2: 9+3+1+7+8+4=32
 cell 3: neighbors of (1,1): adjacent cells: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (0,2)? in grid, (2,1):10, (1,2):11 or not, (0,1):4, (1,0):2, (2,0):9, (0,2):12, so if all are neighbors, sum 10+11+4+2+9+12=48, but may not be all adjacent.

In the grid, cell (1,1) is adjacent to (1,0):2, (2,0):9, (2,1):10, (1,2): if exists, (0,1):4, (0,2):12, etc.

From distance, in our earlier calculation, distance to (0,0):2, to (1,0):1, to (0,1):1, to (2,0):1, to (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| wait, if (1,2): dx=0, dy=1, ds= -0-1= -1, |0| + |1| + | -1| =2, distance 1, so yes, adjacent.
Similarly to (0,2): dx= -1, dy=1, ds= -(-1)-1=1-1=0, | -1| + |1| + |0| =2, distance 1, so adjacent.
So neighbors: (1,0):2, (2,0):9, (2,1):10, (1,2):11, (0,2):12, (0,1):4
So numbers 2,9,10,11,12,4, sum 2+9+10+11+12+4=48

For cell 2026, if it is in the interior, the sum might be large.

Perhaps for a cell in ring n, the sum of neighbors is roughly 6 times the number, and since 2026 is large, but for accuracy, we need exact.

Perhaps the sum is always even or something, but not helpful.

Another idea: perhaps the grid is such that the number at (x,y) is given by a formula like 1 + 3x(x-1) + y or something, but let's try.
