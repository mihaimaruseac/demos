<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on the hex grid.

From the snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by numbers. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. So, for example, the number 1 should have six neighbors. Looking at the grid, around 1, we have: above-left 4? Let me sketch this.

Assuming the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops? In the given text, it's shown with three rows, and the middle row has five numbers, while the top and bottom have four each. That suggests a hexagonal grid where rows have alternating numbers of cells.

In the middle row: 15,5,1,2,9 — that's five numbers.

Top row: 14,4,3,10 — four numbers? But it has dots, so probably it's incomplete. The dots indicate that it extends, but for the part shown, top row has four numbers, middle has five, bottom has four? Bottom is shown as 16,6,7,8 — that's four numbers. But in a standard hexagonal packing, rows should alternate between, say, n and n-1 or something.

Perhaps it's centered and symmetric. Let me list the numbers around.

From the grid:

- Top row: ...14, 4, 3, 10... but probably symmetric, so likely 14 is left of 4, then 3, then 10, but that might not be adjacent.

I need to interpret the adjacency. Since it's hexagonal, each cell has neighbors in six directions.

Let me assume that the center is 1. Then, directly above it might be 2? But in the middle row, it's 15,5,1,2,9. So to the right of 1 is 2. To the left is 5? Then above 1 is what? Top row has 4 and 3 above? But 4 is above-left, 3 above-right or something.

Looking at the neighbors of 1. From the grid, 1 is surrounded by 5,2, and others. In the middle row: left is 5, right is 2. Now, above: top row has 4 and 3. Probably 4 is above-left, 3 is above-right. Similarly, below: bottom row has 6 and 7? Bottom row is 16,6,7,8. So below 1 is 6? Then left of 6 is 16? But 16 might be below-left of 1.

Let me try to list the neighbors of 1.

From the arrangement, likely:

- Left: 5

- Right: 2

- Upper-left: 4? But 4 is in top row, and 5 is left, so probably adjacent to both.

In hexagonal grid, if we consider axial coordinates, it might be easier.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the arrangement is often such that each "ring" has more cells.

Let me try to reconstruct the spiral.

Start with center: 1.

Then, probably, we add layers around.

In hexagonal grid, the first ring (distance 1) has 6 cells.

Then second ring has 12 cells, third has 18, and so on, since each ring adds 6 more cells than the previous? The number of cells in ring k is 6k for k>=1, but ring 0 is 1 cell.

Ring 0: 1 cell

Ring 1: 6 cells

Ring 2: 12 cells? But 6*2=12, yes.

Ring 3: 18 cells, etc.

Total cells up to ring k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1

k=1: 1+6=7

k=2: 1+6+12=19? But in the grid shown, we have numbers up to 16, and 19 is larger, but probably not filled yet.

In the snippet, we have numbers 1 to 16, but arranged in a spiral.

List the numbers in order.

The spiral probably starts at 1, then moves to adjacent cells.

Typically, it might move in a direction and turn at corners.

From 1, it might go to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right?), then to 4 (up-left?), but in the grid, above 1 is not directly given.

From the grid: after 1 is 2, then probably 3,4,etc.

The sequence: 1, then 2 is right, then above 2 might be 3? In top row, 3 is next to 4, but 2 is below.

Look at the positions.

Assume the grid is oriented with horizontal rows.

Row 0 (center): cells at x=0,y=0: 1

Then row -1 (above): probably two cells or something.

From the snippet:

Top row: positions say y=-1: cells at x=-1:14? x=0:4? x=1:3? x=2:10? But that seems asymmetric.

Notice that in middle row (y=0): x=-2:15? x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Bottom row (y=1): x=-2:16? x=-1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8? and probably more.

But top row has only up to x=2, while middle has x=-2 to x=2, so top row might be offset.

In hexagonal grid with flat tops, rows are offset.

Typically, for row y, cells at x such that x+y even or something.

Set coordinates.

Assume axial coordinates for hex grid.

Let q and r be the two coordinates, with q+r+s=0 where s is redundant.

Standard axial coordinates: each cell has (q,r), and neighbors are (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1) or something.

The six neighbors are: (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1) — I think that's standard.

And the third coordinate s = -q-r, so q+r+s=0.

Now, in this coordinate system, the distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) or something? Actually, in axial coordinates, the distance from (0,0) is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, but since s=-q-r, |q| + |r| + |q+r|, but it's a bit messy.

The Manhattan distance in hex grid is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 where ds = -dq -dr, but actually, the distance is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) only if we use cube coordinates, but in axial, it's similar.

To simplify, the ring number k consists of cells where the maximum of |q|,|r|,|s| is k, but since s=-q-r, it's equivalent to max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) = k.

For example, ring 0: (0,0)

Ring 1: all cells with max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) =1, which are (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1) — let's list:

q r s= -q-r

(1,0,-1) max| | =1

(0,1,-1)

(-1,1,0) max=1

(-1,0,1)

(0,-1,1)

(1,-1,0)

Yes, six cells.

Ring 2: max=2, so |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |q+r|<=2, but not in ring 0 or 1.

For example (2,0,-2), (2,-1,-1)? s= -2+1= -1, |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=1, max=2

(2,1,-3)? s=-3, |s|=3>2, so not.

The cells are those with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2.

Number: for each "direction", but total 6*2=12 cells? Since each side has 2 cells per edge.

General: ring k has 6k cells for k>=1.

Total cells up to ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Now, in the spiral, the numbers are filled in order, probably starting from center and moving outward.

The direction of spiral might be clockwise or counterclockwise.

From the given snippet, we can infer.

At center: (0,0): 1

Then ring 1: six cells numbered 2 to 7.

But in the grid, around 1, we have 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in snippet, we see 2,5,6,7,8,9,14,15,16, so probably ring 1 is 2 to 7.

In snippet: middle row has 1,2,5,9? 5 is left, 2 right, then above 1 is not shown directly, but top row has 3 and 4.

Assume that from 1, it goes to 2 (say east), then to 3 (northeast), then to 4 (northwest), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (southwest), then to 7 (southeast), but in snippet, bottom has 6,7,8, so 6 and 7 are below.

In bottom row: 16,6,7,8 — so 6 and 7 are at y=1, x=-1 and x=0? Earlier I had bottom row y=1: x=-2:16, x=-1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8

Middle y=0: x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Top y=-1: x=-1:14? x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10? But 10 is there, and probably symmetric.

Now, neighbors of 1: should be the six cells around it.

At (0,0), neighbors are (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)

From grid:

At (1,0): in middle row, x=1,y=0: number 2

At (-1,0): x=-1,y=0: number 5

At (0,1): bottom row, but y=1, x=0: number 7? Since bottom row has x=0:7

At (0,-1): top row, y=-1, x=0: number 4? Top row has x=0:4

Now, (1,-1): top row, y=-1, x=1: number 3? Since x=1,y=-1:3

(-1,1): bottom row, y=1, x=-1: number 6? Since x=-1,y=1:6

And (-1,0) is already 5, but (-1,1) is different.

The neighbors are:

- (1,0): 2

- (-1,0): 5

- (0,1): 7? But in bottom row x=0,y=1:7

- (0,-1):4? Top row x=0,y=-1:4

- (1,-1):3? Top row x=1,y=-1:3

- (-1,1):6? Bottom row x=-1,y=1:6

So neighbors of 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7? But 7 is at (0,1), which is directly below? Depending on orientation.

In axial coordinates, (0,1) might be south, (0,-1) north, etc.

But numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7 — yes, so ring 1 has numbers 2 to 7.

Now, next numbers: 8,9,10,... up to 16 and beyond.

Ring 2 should have 12 cells, numbers 8 to 19.

In snippet, we see 8,9,10,14,15,16.

Bottom row has 8 at x=1,y=1

Middle has 9 at x=2,y=0

Top has 10 at x=2,y=-1? Assuming top row has x=2:10

Also 14 at x=-1,y=-1? Top row x=-1:14? Earlier I assumed top row y=-1: x=-1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10

Similarly, bottom y=1: x=-2:16? Earlier I said x=-2:16, but is that correct? In snippet: ".. 16 6 7 8 ..." so for bottom row, it starts with 16, then 6,7,8, so probably x=-2:16, x=-1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8

Similarly, middle: "15 5 1 2 9" so x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Top: "14 4 3 10" so x=-1:14? But if symmetric, probably x=-2 should be there, but it's not listed, but dots suggest it might be present. The dots indicate continuation, so likely top row has x=-2: some number, but not shown. Similarly for others.

But from the numbers, we can infer.

Now, the spiral continues. After ring 1 is filled (cells 2-7), it moves to ring 2.

Typically, it starts from a certain direction. From 7, where is 7? At (0,1). Probably it moves to an adjacent cell not yet filled.

The cell adjacent to 7 that is in ring 2.

Ring 2 cells have max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2.

For example, from (0,1), neighbors are (1,1),( -1,1),(0,2),(0,0),(1,0),(-1,2)? 

Neighbors: (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1)

Standard: for (q,r), neighbors: (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)

So for (0,1): 

(1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0), (1,0), (-1,2)? (q-1,r+1)=(-1,2)

But (0,0) is center, already filled. (1,0) is 2, filled. (-1,1) is 6, filled? Earlier we have at (-1,1):6? Bottom row x=-1,y=1:6, yes.

So neighbors: (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), and (1,0),(0,0) filled.

Now, (1,1) and (0,2) and (-1,2) are candidates for ring 2.

In the grid, what is filled next? After 7, probably 8.

Where is 8? In bottom row, at x=1,y=1:8

So (1,1):8

Then next? Probably 9. Where is 9? In middle row, x=2,y=0:9

So (2,0):9

Then 10? Top row, x=2,y=-1:10? So (2,-1):10

Then probably 11,12,etc.

But we also have 14,15,16.

14 is at top row x=-1,y=-1? Earlier top row has x=-1:14? Assuming y=-1, x=-1:14

Similarly, 15 at middle x=-2,y=0:15

16 at bottom x=-2,y=1:16

Now, so far we have:

List all cells:

Center: (0,0):1

Ring 1:

(1,0):2

(1,-1):3? Earlier top row x=1,y=-1:3

(0,-1):4? x=0,y=-1:4

(-1,0):5? x=-1,y=0:5

(-1,1):6? x=-1,y=1:6

(0,1):7? x=0,y=1:7

Now ring 2:

(1,1):8? x=1,y=1:8

(2,0):9? x=2,y=0:9

(2,-1):10? x=2,y=-1:10

Now next? After 10, probably 11. Where? Could be (2,-2) or (1,-2) or something.

But we have ( -1,-1) probably. Top row has x=-1,y=-1:14? But 14 is larger, so probably filled later.

The spiral might go clockwise or counterclockwise.

From 7 at (0,1), went to (1,1):8 (east or southeast)

Then to (2,0):9 (northwest? From (1,1) to (2,0): q+1,r-1, which is northwest if we consider r increasing down or up.

In axial coordinates, if we assume r increases downward, then (0,1) is south, (1,0) is east, etc.

From (1,1) to (2,0): delta q=+1, r=-1, so southeast? Let's see direction.

From (1,1) to (2,0): q increases by 1, r decreases by 1, so if r is vertical, it's moving right and up? But in our grid, y is vertical, with y increasing down? In our earlier assignment, for bottom row y=1, top y=-1, so y increases downward.

So at (q,r), but in axial, r might not be y.

In standard axial coordinates, sometimes q and r are not aligned with axes, but we can define.

In our grid, we have assigned Cartesian-like coordinates: we set row y, and column x.

In hexagonal grid with flat tops, the rows are horizontal, and each row is offset.

Specifically, for row y, the x-coordinates are integers, and adjacent rows are shifted.

In this case, from the positions, we see that for even y or odd y, the x starts differently.

In our case:

- Row y=0 (middle): x from -2 to 2? But we have cells at x=-2,-1,0,1,2 all present? In snippet, x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9, so five cells, which suggests that for y=0, it's the "long" row.

Row y=-1 (top): we have x=-1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10, but probably also x=-2: some number, not shown.

Similarly, row y=1 (bottom): x=-2:16, x=-1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8, and probably x=2: some number.

In a standard hex grid, for a given size, the number of cells per row varies.

For ring k, the grid extends from y=-k to y=k, and for each y, x from -k to k, but with the constraint that |x| + |y| <= something, but in hex, it's different.

In axial coordinates, the range of q and r can be defined.

From the neighbors, we can see that for a cell at (x,y), its neighbors depend on y parity.

For example, at (0,0): neighbors might be (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1) — but in terms of (x,y), if we use the same x,y as Cartesian.

In our assignment, at (0,0):1

Its neighbors:

- (1,0):2

- (-1,0):5

- (0,1):7? But (0,1) is directly below, but in bottom row, at (0,1):7, but also there is (1,1):8, etc.

The neighbor to the southeast might be (1,1), but (1,1) is not adjacent to (0,0)? Distance.

In hex grid, adjacent cells have different distances.

The distance between (0,0) and (1,0) is 1, since |dq|=1, dr=0.

(0,0) and (0,1): dq=0, dr=1, distance |0|+|1|+| -1| /2? Earlier we used axial, but if we use (x,y) as coordinates, we need to define adjacency.

To avoid confusion, let's stick with the axial coordinates we started with.

Define q and r such that:

From earlier, for (0,0):1

(1,0):2

(1,-1):3? But (1,-1) is not a neighbor of (0,0)? Distance: dq=1, dr=-1, ds = -dq-dr =0, so |dq|+|dr|+|ds| =1+1+0=2, distance 1, yes adjacent.

Similarly, (0,-1):4, dq=0,dr=-1,ds=1, |0|+|-1|+|1|=2, dist1.

(-1,0):5

(-1,1):6? dq=-1,dr=1,ds=0, dist1.

(0,1):7

All good.

Now for ring 2 cells: max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2, s=-q-r.

Cells: q from -2 to 2, r from -2 to 2, but not all, only those with max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|)=2.

For example (2,0,s=-2), max=2

(2,-1,s=-1), max=2

(2,-2,s=0), max=2

(1,1,s=-2), max=2

(1,0,s=-1) but max=1, already in ring1

(1,-1,s=0), ring1

(1,-2,s=1), max=2? |q|=1,|r|=2,|s|=1, max=2

Similarly (0,2,s=-2), max=2

(0,-2,s=2), max=2

(-1,2,s=-1), max=2

(-1,-1,s=2)? |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, max=2

(-2,0,s=2), max=2

(-2,1,s=1), max=2

(-2,-1,s=3)? |s|=3>2, not

List all:

- q=2,r=0,s=-2

- q=2,r=-1,s=-1

- q=2,r=-2,s=0

- q=1,r=1,s=-2

- q=1,r=-2,s=1

- q=0,r=2,s=-2

- q=0,r=-2,s=2

- q=-1,r=2,s=-1

- q=-1,r=-1,s=2? s=-(-1)-(-1)=1+1=2, yes

- q=-2,r=0,s=2

- q=-2,r=1,s=1

- q=-2,r=-1,s=3? s=-(-2)-(-1)=2+1=3, |s|=3>2, not

q=-1,r=-1,s=2, max=2

q=-2,r=0,s=2

q=-2,r=1,s=1

Now q=1,r=1,s=-2

q=1,r=-2,s=1? Earlier I have q=1,r=-2,s=1

But r=-2, etc.

Total: let's list:

(2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

(1,1), (1,-2)  // since (1,0),(1,-1) are ring1

(0,2), (0,-2)

(-1,2), (-1,-1)  // (-1,0),(-1,1) ring1

(-2,0), (-2,1)  // (-2,-1) not since |s|=3>2

Is that all? 3+2+2+2+2=11? But should be 12. Missing one.

What about ( -1, -1) is listed, but (0,1) is ring1, etc.

q=0,r=0 not.

(1,2)? q=1,r=2,s=-3, |s|=3>2, not

(-1,-2)? q=-1,r=-2,s=3, |s|=3>2, not

(2,1)? q=2,r=1,s=-3, |s|=3>2, not

So only those 11? But should be 12. I missed q=-2,r=-1? But |s|=3.

q=0,r=1 is ring1.

Perhaps ( -1,1) is ring1, but for ring2, I have (-1,2), etc.

List with max| | =2.

The cells where at least one of |q|,|r|,|s| is 2, and all <=2, but since s=-q-r, and |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |s|<=2 implies |q+r|<=2, and the condition max=2 means not all | | <2, i.e., not in inner rings.

The set is all (q,r) with |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |q+r|<=2, and max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|)=2.

|q+r| is |s|, yes.

Now, for example (2,0): |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2, max=2

(2,-1): |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=1, max=2

(2,-2): |q|=2,|r|=2,|s|=0, max=2

(1,1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, max=2

(1,-2): |q|=1,|r|=2,|s|=1, max=2

(0,2): |q|=0,|r|=2,|s|=2, max=2

(0,-2): |q|=0,|r|=2,|s|=2, max=2? |r|=2, |s|=2

( -1,2): |q|=1,|r|=2,|s|=1, max=2

( -1,-1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, max=2

( -2,0): |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2, max=2

( -2,1): |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=1, max=2

( -2,-1): |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=3, |s|=3>2, not included

(1,0): |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1, max=1<2, not

(0,1): |q|=0,|r|=1,|s|=1, max=1<2, not

( -1,0): |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1, max=1<2, not

Now (0,0) max0

(1,-1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=0, max=1<2

(-1,1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=0, max=1<2

So the ring2 cells are: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2),(1,1),(1,-2),(0,2),(0,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-1),(-2,0),(-2,1)

That's 11 cells, but should be 12. Missing one.

What about ( -2, -1)? |s|=3>2, not

(2,1)? |s|=3>2, not

(0,0) no

(1,2)? |s|=3>2, not

Perhaps ( -1, -2)? q= -1, r= -2, s= -(-1)-(-2)=1+2=3, |s|=3>2, not

But 6*2=12, so must be 12 cells. I think I missed (0,1) but it's ring1.

Perhaps the center is included, but no.

Another cell: (1,0) is ring1, but for example (3,0) is ring3.

Let's calculate the number. In hex grid, number of cells at distance exactly k is 6k for k>0.

Distance k means the ring number.

For k=2, cells with hex distance 2.

Hex distance between (0,0) and (q,r) is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 where s= -q-r, and since |q| + |r| + |s| is even, it's integer.

For (2,0): |2|+|0|+| -2| =2+0+2=4, distance 2

(2,-1): |2|+|-1|+| -1| =2+1+1=4, dist2

(2,-2): |2|+|-2|+|0| =2+2+0=4, dist2

(1,1): |1|+|1|+| -2| =1+1+2=4, dist2

(1,-2): |1|+|-2|+|1| =1+2+1=4, dist2

(0,2): |0|+|2|+| -2| =0+2+2=4, dist2

(0,-2): |0|+|-2|+|2| =0+2+2=4, dist2

(-1,2): |-1|+|2|+| -1| =1+2+1=4, dist2

(-1,-1): |-1|+|-1|+|2| =1+1+2=4, dist2

(-2,0): |-2|+|0|+|2| =2+0+2=4, dist2

(-2,1): |-2|+|1|+|1| =2+1+1=4, dist2

Now (-2,-1): |-2|+|-1|+|3| =2+1+3=6, dist3, not

(2,1): |2|+|1|+|-3| =2+1+3=6, dist3

(1,2): |1|+|2|+|-3| =1+2+3=6, dist3

(-1,-2): |-1|+|-2|+|3| =1+2+3=6, dist3

(0,1): |0|+|1|+|-1| =0+1+1=2, dist1, already in ring1

But we have only 11 cells listed, but should be 12. What's missing?

Ah, ( -2, -1) is dist3, but what about (1, -1)? |1|+|-1|+|0| =1+1+0=2, dist1, ring1.

Perhaps (2,0) is included, but is there ( -1,0)? dist1.

I think I missed (0,0) but no.

Another one: (3,0) dist3.

Perhaps ( -1,1) is dist1, but for ring2, is there a cell like (0,0) no.

Let's list all cells with dist2: the sum |q| + |r| + |s| =4, with s= -q-r.

So |q| + |r| + |q+r| =4.

Possible:

- q=2, r=0, |q+r|=2, sum 2+0+2=4

- q=2, r=-1, |q+r|=|1|=1, sum 2+1+1=4

- q=2, r=-2, |q+r|=0, sum 2+2+0=4

- q=1, r=1, |q+r|=2, sum 1+1+2=4

- q=1, r=0, |q+r|=1, sum 1+0+1=2<4

- q=1, r=-1, |q+r|=0, sum 1+1+0=2<4

- q=1, r=-2, |q+r|=|-1|=1, sum 1+2+1=4

- q=0, r=2, |q+r|=2, sum 0+2+2=4

- q=0, r=-2, |q+r|=2, sum 0+2+2=4

- q=0, r=1, |q+r|=1, sum 0+1+1=2<4

- q=0, r=0, sum0

- q=0, r=-1, sum2

- q=-1, r=2, |q+r|=|1|=1, sum 1+2+1=4

- q=-1, r=1, |q+r|=0, sum 1+1+0=2<4

- q=-1, r=0, sum1+0+1=2<4

- q=-1, r=-1, |q+r|=|-2|=2, sum 1+1+2=4

- q=-1, r=-2, |q+r|=|-3|=3, sum 1+2+3=6>4

- q=-2, r=2, |q+r|=0, sum 2+2+0=4? |q|=2, |r|=2, |s|=| -(-2)-2|=|2-2|=0, sum 2+2+0=4, dist2

I missed this! q=-2, r=2, s=0, |q|=2, |r|=2, |s|=0, max=2, sum 4, dist2.

Similarly, q=2,r=2,s=-4, |s|=4>2, dist4, not.

So ( -2,2): | -2| + |2| + |0| =2+2+0=4, dist2.

Similarly, is there (2,2)? |2|+|2|+|-4|=2+2+4=8, dist4.

Or ( -2,-2): | -2| + | -2| + |4| =2+2+4=8, dist4.

So add ( -2,2)

Now we have 12 cells: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2),(1,1),(1,-2),(0,2),(0,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-1),(-2,0),(-2,1),(-2,2)

Yes.

In the grid, we need to assign numbers to these in spiral order.

From the snippet, we have some assignments.

We know:

(1,1):8  (bottom right, x=1,y=1)

(2,0):9  (middle right, x=2,y=0)

(2,-1):10 (top right, x=2,y=-1)

Now, after 10, what is next? Probably (2,-2) or (1,-2) or (0,-2), etc.

In the top row, we have at x=-1,y=-1:14, which is larger, so probably filled later.

The spiral likely continues from 10 at (2,-1) to the next cell in ring2.

Typically, it might go left or down.

From the pattern, after filling ring1, it was at (0,1):7, then moved to (1,1):8 (east), then to (2,0):9 (northwest? ), then to (2,-1):10 (north? ).

From (2,-1), it might go to (2,-2) (west), or to (1,-2) (southwest), or to (1,-1) but (1,-1) is already filled with 3.

So likely to (2,-2) or (1,-2).

Suppose to (2,-2):11

Then to (1,-2):12

Then to (0,-2):13

Then to (-1,-1):14? But in top row, at x=-1,y=-1:14, so likely (-1,-1):14

Then next? To (-1,-2)? But (-1,-2) is not in ring2, as |s|=3, dist3.

From (-1,-1), neighbors in ring2: for example (-2,-1) not, (-2,0), or (-1,0) but (-1,0) is filled with 5.

So likely to (-2,0):15? And in middle row, x=-2,y=0:15, so (-2,0):15

Then to (-2,1):16? Bottom row, x=-2,y=1:16, so (-2,1):16

Then to (-2,2):17? Not shown, but probably.

Then to (-1,2):18

Then to (0,2):19

Then ring2 is filled.

In snippet, we have 14,15,16, and next would be 17,18,19, but snippet shows only up to 16, so consistent.

So the order for ring2: starting from (1,1):8, then (2,0):9, (2,-1):10, (2,-2):11, (1,-2):12, (0,-2):13, (-1,-1):14, (-2,0):15, (-2,1):16, (-2,2):17, (-1,2):18, (0,2):19

Now, is this clockwise or counterclockwise? From (1,1) to (2,0): decreasing r, increasing q, so if r is vertical down, it's moving right and up? Then to (2,-1): same q, r decreases (up), then to (2,-2): same q, r decreases (up), then to (1,-2): q decreases (left), r same, then to (0,-2): q decreases (left), r same, then to (-1,-1): q decreases, r increases? From (0,-2) to (-1,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, so left and down? Since r increases down.

In terms of direction: from start, after 7 at (0,1), went to (1,1):8 (east), then to (2,0):9 (northwest), then to (2,-1):10 (north), then to (2,-2):11 (north), but same direction? Then to (1,-2):12 (west), then to (0,-2):13 (west), then to (-1,-1):14 (southwest? delta q=-1, delta r=+1, so if r down, it's southwest), then to (-2,0):15 (west? delta q=-1, delta r=+1? From (-1,-1) to (-2,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, same as before, southwest? But should be different.

From (-1,-1) to (-2,0): q from -1 to -2, r from -1 to 0, so delta q = -1, delta r = +1.

Then to (-2,1): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (south)

Then to (-2,2): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (south), but then to (-1,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (east)? From (-2,2) to (-1,2): q+1, r same, east.

Then to (0,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (east)

So the path is: from (0,1) to (1,1) (east), then (2,0) (northwest), then (2,-1) (north), then (2,-2) (north), then (1,-2) (west), then (0,-2) (west), then (-1,-1) (southwest), then (-2,0) (southwest? same direction?), but from (0,-2) to (-1,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=+1

From (-1,-1) to (-2,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, same vector, so same direction.

But in a spiral, it should turn at corners. Perhaps it's not turning yet.

Then to (-2,1): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (south)

But if it was going southwest, now south, so it turned.

Then to (-2,2): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (south), same.

Then to (-1,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (east)

Then to (0,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (east)

So the turning points are when it changes direction.

But anyway, the order is as above.

Now, we have the sequence: cell (q,r) and number n.

We need to find for which n, the cell is occupied by 2026, then find its six neighbors, and sum their numbers.

First, find the ring number k for n=2026.

Total numbers up to ring k is S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1) for k>=0.

S(k) = 1 + 3k^2 + 3k

S(k) is the last number of ring k.

Ring k starts at? Ring 0: n=1

Ring 1: n=2 to 7

Ring 2: n=8 to 19? Since 1+6+12=19, yes.

Ring 3: 18 cells? 6*3=18, so n=20 to 37? S(2)=19, S(3)=19+18=37.

S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

S(0)=1

S(1)=1+3*1*2=1+6=7

S(2)=1+3*2*3=1+18=19

S(3)=1+3*3*4=1+36=37

S(4)=1+3*4*5=1+60=61

Etc.

Now, find k such that S(k-1) < 2026 <= S(k)

S(k) = 3k^2 + 3k +1

Solve 3k^2 + 3k +1 >= 2026

3k^2 + 3k -2025 >=0

Divide by 3: k^2 + k -675 >=0

Solve quadratic: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let's see 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97

So k >= [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈25.485

So k=26? Since k must be integer.

Check S(25) and S(26)

S(k)=3k(k+1)+1

S(25)=3*25*26 +1=3*650+1=1950+1=1951

S(26)=3*26*27 +1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107

Now 1951 < 2026 <= 2107, so yes, n=2026 is in ring k=26.

Ring k=26 has how many cells? 6*26=156 cells.

The first number in ring k is S(k-1)+1

S(25)=1951, so ring 26 starts at n=1952.

Ends at S(26)=2107.

So numbers from 1952 to 2107.

2026 is in this ring.

Now, we need to find the position (q,r) for n=2026.

Then find its neighbors, then their numbers, sum them.

In a spiral, the position depends on the path and the starting point.

From the initial pattern, we can infer the direction.

In ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells.

The spiral starts at a certain point and moves in a certain direction.

From ring1: started at (1,0):2, then went to (1,-1):3, (0,-1):4, (-1,0):5, (-1,1):6, (0,1):7? But earlier we had (1,0):2, then probably (1,-1):3? But in our earlier assignment for ring1, we didn't specify order, but in the filling, it was filled in order.

In ring1, the numbers: we have (1,0):2, (1,-1):3, (0,-1):4, (-1,0):5, (-1,1):6, (0,1):7.

But the order of filling: probably started at (1,0):2, then next? After 1, went to 2 at (1,0), then to 3 at (1,-1)? Adjacent? From (1,0) to (1,-1): delta q=0, delta r=-1, so north.

Then to (0,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=0, west.

Then to (-1,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1? From (0,-1) to (-1,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, southwest.

But earlier for ring2, it was different.

Perhaps the direction is consistent.

In ring1: from center (0,0), moved east to (1,0):2, then continued in same direction? But next should be adjacent to 2 and not filled.

From (1,0), neighbors: (2,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1)? But (0,0) filled, so (2,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(0,1),(-1,1)

But (0,1) and (-1,1) are also neighbors, but in ring1, it should be filled next.

In our case, it went to (1,-1):3, which is north.

Then from there to (0,-1):4, west? Delta q=-1, delta r=0.

Then to (-1,0):5, southwest? Delta q=-1, delta r=+1.

Then to (-1,1):6, south? Delta q=0, delta r=+1.

Then to (0,1):7, east? Delta q=+1, delta r=0.

So the path: east, north, west, southwest? But southwest is not a cardinal direction; in hex, directions are symmetric.

The sequence of moves: from start: east to (1,0), then north to (1,-1), then west to (0,-1), then southwest to (-1,0), then south to (-1,1), then east to (0,1).

But southwest and south are not consistent; it changed direction multiple times.

For ring k, it starts at a specific cell and moves in a fixed direction for k steps, then turns.

In ring1, since only 6 cells, it might be filled in sequence without straight lines.

For higher rings, it has straight segments.

From ring2: started at (1,1):8, then to (2,0):9, which is not adjacent in a straight line; from (1,1) to (2,0) is delta q=+1, delta r=-1, which is northwest if r up, but in our case r down.

Delta q=+1, delta r=-1, so if r increases down, it's moving right and up.

Then to (2,-1): delta q=0, delta r=-1 (up), then to (2,-2): delta q=0, delta r=-1 (up), so two steps up.

Then to (1,-2): delta q=-1, delta r=0 (left), then to (0,-2): delta q=-1, delta r=0 (left), so two steps left.

Then to (-1,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=+1 (southwest), but only one step? Then to (-2,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1 (southwest), so two steps southwest? From (0,-2) to (-1,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, then to (-2,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, same direction.

Then to (-2,1): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (down), then to (-2,2): delta q=0, delta r=+1 (down), two steps down.

Then to (-1,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (right), then to (0,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0 (right), two steps right.

So in ring2, each side has 2 cells, and it moves in a direction for 2 steps, then turns 60 degrees counterclockwise or something.

The directions: started at (1,1), moved northwest to (2,0)? From (1,1) to (2,0): q+1,r-1, which is, if we consider the hex directions, it might be "north" or "northeast", but in terms of standard hex directions, let's define the six directions.

Typically, the six directions can be defined by vectors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) or something.

In our case, from the move from (1,1) to (2,0): delta q=+1, delta r=-1

Which is not one of the standard neighbor vectors; standard are (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), etc., but (1,-1) is a standard direction.

(1,-1) is one of the six: (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1)? Let's list the six neighbor vectors:

From (0,0): (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) — yes, as we had earlier.

But from (1,1) to (2,0): delta q=+1, delta r=-1, which is exactly the vector (1,-1)

Similarly, from (2,0) to (2,-1): delta q=0, delta r=-1, which is (0,-1)

From (2,-1) to (2,-2): delta q=0, delta r=-1, same (0,-1)

Then from (2,-2) to (1,-2): delta q=-1, delta r=0, which is (-1,0)

Then to (0,-2): same (-1,0)

Then from (0,-2) to (-1,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, which is (-1,1)

Then to (-2,0): same (-1,1)

Then from (-2,0) to (-2,1): delta q=0, delta r=+1, which is (0,1)

Then to (-2,2): same (0,1)

Then from (-2,2) to (-1,2): delta q=+1, delta r=0, which is (1,0)

Then to (0,2): same (1,0)

So the sequence of directions: first move in direction (1,-1) for 2 steps? From (1,1) to (2,0): one step in (1,-1), but then next is (0,-1), different.

Actually, it didn't move multiple steps in the same direction consecutively for the first move.

From start of ring: at (1,1), moved to (2,0) in direction (1,-1), then to (2,-1) in direction (0,-1), which is a different direction.

But (1,-1) and (0,-1) are adjacent directions; turning 60 degrees.

Then continued in (0,-1) to (2,-2)

Then turned to (-1,0) and moved to (1,-2) and (0,-2)

Then turned to (-1,1) and moved to (-1,-1) and (-2,0)

Then turned to (0,1) and moved to (-2,1) and (-2,2)

Then turned to (1,0) and moved to (-1,2) and (0,2)

So for each side, it moves k steps in the same direction? In this case k=2, but for the first "side", it moved only one step in (1,-1), but then immediately turned.

The first cell of the ring is at a corner, and it moves along the side.

In ring k, there are 6 corners, and between corners, there are k-1 cells per side, but since it's a spiral, the side has k cells, including the corner.

For ring k, each side has exactly k cells.

The spiral starts at a specific corner and moves in a fixed sequence of directions.

From ring2, it started at (1,1), which is not a corner in the usual sense; in the hex, corners are where two axes meet.

The corners of the hexagon for ring k are at (k,0), (k,-k), (0,-k), (-k,0), (-k,k), (0,k) or something.

For example, ring1 corners: (1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1) — all are corners since only one cell per side.

Ring2: corners might be (2,0),(2,-2),(0,-2),(-2,0),(-2,2),(0,2) — the "extreme" points.

In our filling, we started at (1,1), which is not a corner; (1,1) is on the side between (2,0) and (0,2)? For example.

The starting point for each ring is usually adjacent to the last cell of previous ring.

At the end of ring1, we were at (0,1):7

Then we moved to (1,1):8, which is adjacent; delta q=+1, delta r=0? From (0,1) to (1,1): delta q=+1, delta r=0, so east.

Then from there, we moved to (2,0): delta q=+1, delta r=-1, which is northeast or something.

To generalize, for ring k, it starts at the cell in the direction of the last move or something.

From ring1 to ring2: last cell of ring1 is (0,1):7, last move was to (0,1) from (-1,1)? In ring1, from (-1,1) to (0,1): delta q=+1, delta r=0, east.

Then to start ring2, it moves to (1,1):8, which is also east, same direction.

Then, instead of continuing east, it turns to a different direction. In this case, from (1,1) it moved to (2,0) in direction (1,-1), which is not east.

Perhaps it turns 60 degrees counterclockwise.

The six directions can be ordered. Let's list the six vectors in order, say clockwise.

Define the six directions as vectors: let's say D0 = (1,0)  // east

D1 = (1,-1) // northeast

D2 = (0,-1) // north

D3 = (-1,0) // west

D4 = (-1,1) // southwest

D5 = (0,1) // south

In our earlier moves:

From (1,1) to (2,0): delta (1,-1) = D1

Then to (2,-1): delta (0,-1) = D2

Then to (2,-2): delta (0,-1) = D2

Then to (1,-2): delta (-1,0) = D3

Then to (0,-2): delta (-1,0) = D3

Then to (-1,-1): delta (-1,1) = D4

Then to (-2,0): delta (-1,1) = D4

Then to (-2,1): delta (0,1) = D5

Then to (-2,2): delta (0,1) = D5

Then to (-1,2): delta (1,0) = D0

Then to (0,2): delta (1,0) = D0

So the sequence of directions for the moves: D1, D2, D2, D3, D3, D4, D4, D5, D5, D0, D0

But for each "side", it moves in one direction for k steps, but here for k=2, it moved two steps in D2, two in D3, etc., but the first move was D1 for only one step, then D2 for two steps.

The first direction is D1 for 1 step, then D2 for 2 steps, D3 for 2 steps, D4 for 2 steps, D5 for 2 steps, D0 for 2 steps, but that's 1+2+2+2+2+2=11, but there are 12 cells, and 12 moves? From start to end, there are 11 moves for 12 cells.

The first cell is at (1,1), then after first move to (2,0), second move to (2,-1), etc., up to last move to (0,2), so 11 moves for 12 cells.

The number of moves in each direction: D1:1, D2:2, D3:2, D4:2, D5:2, D0:2, sum 11, good.

But for a general ring k, it should be similar.

For ring1: 6 cells, 5 moves.

Started at (1,0):2, then to (1,-1):3 (delta (0,-1)=D2), then to (0,-1):4 (delta (-1,0)=D3? From (1,-1) to (0,-1): delta q=-1, delta r=0, which is D3 (west)

Then to (-1,0):5 (delta (-1,1)? From (0,-1) to (-1,0): delta q=-1, delta r=+1, D4 (southwest)

Then to (-1,1):6 (delta (0,1)=D5 (south))

Then to (0,1):7 (delta (1,0)=D0 (east))

So moves: D2, D3, D4, D5, D0 — that's 5 moves, but only one per direction, while for k=1, it should be k steps per side, but here only one step per direction.

The first cell is at a corner, and it moves along the sides.

For ring k, it starts at a corner, and moves along each side for k steps, but since corners are shared, the total cells are 6k.

The starting corner for each ring is in a specific direction from center.

For ring1, it started at (1,0), which is east, D0.

Then moved to (1,-1) in D2 (north), then to (0,-1) in D3 (west), etc.

The sequence of directions for moves: from start, it moves in D2 for 1 step? But only one step.

For ring k, the number of moves in each direction is k, but since there are 6 directions, total moves 6k, but for k cells per side, with k moves per side, but each side has k cells, but the move between cells is within the side, and at corners it turns.

In a side of k cells, there are k-1 moves within the side in the same direction, and at the corner, it turns to the next direction.

For ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells. The spiral starts at the first cell of the first side, then moves along the side for k-1 moves in the first direction to the end of the side, then at the corner, it turns to the next direction and moves k steps in that direction? But that would be too many.

Standard way: for a hexagonal spiral, when moving from ring k-1 to ring k, it starts at a cell adjacent to the last cell of ring k-1, in a specific direction.

Then for each side of the hexagon, it moves along that side for k steps in a fixed direction, but since the side has k cells, moving k steps would cover k+1 cells, which is too many.

Clarify.

In ring k, there are 6k cells. The spiral traverses each cell in order, moving to an adjacent cell each time.

The path has 6k-1 moves for 6k cells.

The moves are grouped into 6 segments, each segment consisting of moves in the same direction, and each segment has exactly k moves, since 6k moves? 6 segments * k moves = 6k moves, but there are only 6k-1 moves, contradiction.

For ring k, number of cells is 6k, so number of moves between them is 6k-1.

But if there are 6 sides, and each side has k cells, then between the k cells on a side, there are k-1 moves along the side, and at each corner, there is a move to the next side, but the corner move is shared.

Total moves = sum over sides of (moves on side) = 6 * (k-1) for the along-side moves, plus 6 moves for the corner turns, but the corner turns are the moves between sides, so total moves = 6(k-1) + 6 = 6k, but there are only 6k-1 moves, so one less.

The issue is that the first and last cells are not connected by a move in the ring; the ring is not closed; it's a path, not a cycle.

In the spiral path for a ring, it starts at one cell and ends at another, with 6k-1 moves.

For ring2, we had 11 moves for 12 cells.

The moves were in directions: D1:1 move, D2:2 moves, D3:2 moves, D4:2 moves, D5:2 moves, D0:2 moves, total 1+2+2+2+2+2=11.

For ring1: 5 moves: D2:1, D3:1, D4:1, D5:1, D0:1, and missing D1 or something? In ring1, we had D2, D3, D4, D5, D0, so five directions, each one move, missing D1.

For ring k, the number of moves in each direction might be k for most, but for the first and last, different.

Notice that for ring k, the first move is in a direction that is "inward" or something.

From the end of previous ring.

At the end of ring k-1, we are at a certain cell with a certain "exit" direction.

For example, end of ring0: at (0,0), but ring0 is just center, so when starting ring1, from (0,0) we move to (1,0) in D0 (east).

Then for ring1, we moved in D2, D3, D4, D5, D0 as above.

End of ring1: at (0,1), and last move was D0 (east) from (-1,1) to (0,1).

Then for ring2, we moved to (1,1) in D0 (east), same direction, then to (2,0) in D1 (northeast), then D2 (north) twice, etc.

So after moving in the same direction as the last move of previous ring for the first move of the new ring, then it turns 60 degrees counterclockwise and moves k steps in that direction? But in this case, from (1,1) we moved to (2,0) in D1, which is a turn from D0.

The turn is 60 degrees CCW.

Then for the next directions, it moves for k steps in each direction, but in ring2, after D1 for one move (to (2,0)), then D2 for two moves ( to (2,-1) and (2,-2)? From (2,0) to (2,-1) is one move, then to (2,-2) is another, so two moves in D2.

Then to (1,-2) in D3, then to (0,-2) in D3, so two moves in D3.

Similarly for others, each subsequent direction has k moves.

For ring2, k=2, so after the first move in D1, then D2 for 2 moves, D3 for 2, D4 for 2, D5 for 2, D0 for 2.

But D0 is the last, and it ended at (0,2).

The first direction after the initial move was D1 for 1 move, but k=2, so not k.

The number of moves in each of the six directions: for ring k, it might be that five directions have k moves, and one has k-1, but in ring2, we have D1:1, D2:2, D3:2, D4:2, D5:2, D0:2, so D1 has 1, others have 2, sum 1+2*5=11 for k=2.

For ring1: k=1, moves: D2:1, D3:1, D4:1, D5:1, D0:1, and D1:0? But sum 5, which is 6*1 -1 =5, but only five directions used, D1 not used.

In ring1, directions used: D2,D3,D4,D5,D0, each 1 move, total 5.

For ring2: D1:1, D2:2, D3:2, D4:2, D5:2, D0:2, total 1+2+2+2+2+2=11.

For ring3, k=3, should have 17 moves? 6*3-1=17.

Probably one direction has k-1=2 moves, others have k=3 moves? 2+3*5=17, yes.

Which direction has fewer? Likely the first one after the initial.

In general, for ring k, after moving from the last cell of previous ring to the first cell of this ring in the same direction, then it turns 60 degrees CCW and moves in that direction for k-1 moves? In ring2, after moving to (1,1) in D0, then turned to D1 and moved 1 move (k-1=1 for k=2), then to D2 and moved 2 moves (k), then D3:2, etc.

In ring2, after first cell (1,1), we moved in D1 for 1 move to (2,0), then in D2 for 2 moves to (2,-2), then in D3 for 2 moves to (0,-2), then in D4 for 2 moves to (-2,0), then in D5 for 2 moves to (-2,2), then in D0 for 2 moves to (0,2).

So the first direction after the start is D1 with k-1=1 move, then the next five directions with k=2 moves each.

For ring1: after start at (1,0), we moved in D2 for ? k-1=0? But we did move.

For ring1, started at (1,0), then moved to (1,-1) in D2, which is one move, but k=1, k-1=0, but we moved one step.

Perhaps for ring k, the number of moves in the first direction of the ring is k-1, and in the next five directions is k.

For ring1: first direction should be? After the initial move from center, but the ring starts after that.

The ring k starts at its first cell, which is adjacent to the last cell of ring k-1.

For ring k, first cell is at position P_k.

From P_k, we move in a sequence.

For ring k, the first move is in direction D_{start}, for m moves, then next directions.

From the pattern:

For ring1: first cell (1,0), then move in D2 (north) to (1,-1) — one move.

Then in D3 (west) to (0,-1) — one move.

Then in D4 (southwest) to (-1,0) — one move.

Then in D5 (south) to (-1,1) — one move.

Then in D0 (east) to (0,1) — one move.

So all moves are one step each, in directions D2,D3,D4,D5,D0.

For ring2: first cell (1,1), then move in D1 (northeast) to (2,0) — one move (k-1=1 for k=2)

Then in D2 (north) to (2,-1) and to (2,-2) — two moves

Then in D3 (west) to (1,-2) and to (0,-2) — two moves

Then in D4 (southwest) to (-1,-1) and to (-2,0) — two moves

Then in D5 (south) to (-2,1) and to (-2,2) — two moves

Then in D0 (east) to (-1,2) and to (0,2) — two moves

So first direction D1 with k-1=1 move, then D2 to D0 each with k=2 moves.

The directions are in order: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D0.

For ring3, probably starts at some cell, then first move in some D with k-1=2 moves, then next five with k=3 moves each.

But what is the starting cell and starting direction for ring k.

Also, the starting direction sequence may rotate.

For ring1, the sequence was D2,D3,D4,D5,D0

For ring2, D1,D2,D3,D4,D5,D0 but with different lengths.

The first direction is different.

Notice that the last direction of previous ring is the same as the first direction of the next ring's initial move, but for the sequence, it shifts.

End of ring1: last move was D0 (east) to (0,1)

Then for ring2, first move from (0,1) to (1,1) in D0 (east), same direction.

Then it turned to D1 for the next move.

So after the initial move in the same direction as last move of previous ring, it turns 60 degrees CCW to the next direction.

The directions are ordered in a cycle: let's list the six directions in counterclockwise order.

Define the order of directions: let's say D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 in CCW order.

From earlier, D0 = (1,0) east

D1 = (1,-1) northeast

D2 = (0,-1) north

D3 = (-1,0) west

D4 = (-1,1) southwest

D5 = (0,1) south

Now, from D0, turning CCW would go to D1, then D2, etc.

After moving in D0 to the first cell of ring k, it turns to D1 and moves in D1 for k-1 moves, then to D2 for k moves, D3 for k moves, D4 for k moves, D5 for k moves, D0 for k moves.

For ring2, after moving to (1,1) in D0, then moved in D1 for 1 move (k-1=1), then D2 for 2, D3 for 2, D4 for 2, D5 for 2, D0 for 2.

But after D0 for 2 moves, it ended at (0,2).

For ring1, it was different because it didn't have the initial move within the ring; the first move was from center.

For ring k >=1, the ring starts after the initial move from the last cell of ring k-1.

For ring k, the first cell is at a position that is offset.

Generalizing, for ring k, the first cell is obtained by moving from the last cell of ring k-1 in the same direction as the last move of ring k-1.

Then, from there, it moves in the next direction CCW for k-1 moves, then in the following directions for k moves each, for the next five directions.

The sequence of moves for ring k is:

- Move in direction D_{s+1} for (k-1) moves

- Then in D_{s+2} for k moves

- Then in D_{s+3} for k moves

- Then in D_{s+4} for k moves

- Then in D_{s+5} for k moves

- Then in D_{s+6} for k moves, but since modulo 6, D_{s+6}=D_s

s is the starting direction index.

For each ring, s is determined by the last direction of previous ring.

Specifically, if the last move of ring k-1 was in direction D_d, then the first move of ring k is in D_d to the first cell, then it moves in D_{d+1} for k-1 moves, then D_{d+2} for k moves, etc.

d+1 modulo 6.

For example, ring1: last move of ring0? Ring0 is center, no move. So we need to define for ring1.

For ring1, it starts by moving from (0,0) to (1,0) in D0.

So the "last move" before ring1 is D0.

Then for ring1, first cell is (1,0), then it should move in D_{0+1}=D1 for k-1=0 moves? But it moved in D2.

Inconsistency.

Perhaps after arriving at the first cell, it turns to the next direction.

For ring k, after arriving at the first cell in direction D_d, it then turns to D_{d+1} and moves in that direction for k-1 moves, then to D_{d+2} for k moves, etc.

For ring1: arrived at (1,0) in D0, then turns to D1, moves in D1 for k-1=0 moves, i.e., no move, but it did move to (1,-1) in D2, not D1.

So not.

Perhaps it turns to D_{d} for the first move, but that doesn't make sense.

Another way: in many spirals, the starting point for ring k is at (k,0) or something, but in our case for ring2, it started at (1,1), not (2,0).

We can determine the position by the index within the ring.

For ring k, there are 6k cells, numbered from 1 to 6k in the ring, with index m = 0 to 6k-1.

Then the position can be determined based on m and k.

From the path, for each m, we can see which side it is on.

For example, in ring2, m=0: cell (1,1)

m=1: after first move, at (2,0)

m=2: at (2,-1)

m=3: at (2,-2)

m=4: at (1,-2)

m=5: at (0,-2)

m=6: at (-1,-1)

m=7: at (-2,0)

m=8: at (-2,1)

m=9: at (-2,2)

m=10: at (-1,2)

m=11: at (0,2)

Now, the sides: the hexagon has sides between corners.

Corners at (2,0), (2,-2), (0,-2), (-2,0), (-2,2), (0,2)

The cells on each side:

Between (2,0) and (2,-2): cells at (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2) — three cells, but for k=2, should be two cells? (2,0) and (2,-2), but (2,-1) is also there, so three cells for a "side", but in the path, it is covered in the D2 moves.

In the path, from m=1 to m=3: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) — three cells, with moves in D2.

Similarly, from m=4 to m=5: (1,-2),(0,-2) — two cells, in D3.

Not uniform.

For a given k and m, the position (q,r).

Notice that the first cell of ring k is at (k,1-k) or something.

For k=1: first cell (1,0)

For k=2: (1,1)

For k=3, probably (2,1) or (2,0), but let's calculate.

End of ring2 at (0,2), last move was D0 (east) from (-1,2) to (0,2).

So for ring3, first move from (0,2) in D0 to (1,2)  // since delta (1,0)

So (1,2):20? Ring3 starts at n=20.

S(2)=19, so ring3: n=20 to 37.

First cell at (1,2):20

Then, should turn to D1 and move for k-1=2 moves in D1.

D1 = (1,-1), so from (1,2) move to (1+1,2-1)=(2,1), then to (2+1,1-1)=(3,0)? 

So (2,1):21, (3,0):22

Then next direction D2 = (0,-1), move for k=3 moves: from (3,0) to (3,-1), then (3,-2), then (3,-3)? So (3,-1):23, (3,-2):24, (3,-3):25

Then D3 = (-1,0), move west: to (2,-3), then (1,-3), then (0,-3)? So (2,-3):26, (1,-3):27, (0,-3):28

Then D4 = (-1,1), move southwest: from (0,-3) to (-1,-2), then (-2,-1), then (-3,0)? So (-1,-2):29, (-2,-1):30, (-3,0):31

Then D5 = (0,1), move south: from (-3,0) to (-3,1), then (-3,2), then (-3,3)? So (-3,1):32, (-3,2):33, (-3,3):34

Then D0 = (1,0), move east: from (-3,3) to (-2,3), then (-1,3), then (0,3)? So (-2,3):35, (-1,3):36, (0,3):37

So ring3 ends at (0,3):37

And the cells match the ring.

Now for n=2026 in ring k=26.

First, find the starting cell of ring26.

Last cell of ring25 is at some position, with last move in some direction.

First, find where ring25 ends.

The last cell of ring k is at a corner, and the last move is in a specific direction.

From the pattern:

Ring1 ends at (0,1), last move D0 (east)

Ring2 ends at (0,2), last move D0 (east)

Ring3 ends at (0,3), last move D0 (east)

So it seems that for all k, the last cell is at (0,k), and last move is D0 (east) to it.

Is that true?

For k=1: (0,1), yes

k=2: (0,2), yes

k=3: (0,3), yes

Probably general.

Similarly, the first cell of ring k is at (1,k-1)? For k=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

k=2: (1,1) = (1,2-1)

k=3: (1,2) = (1,3-1)

Yes, so first cell is at (1,k-1)

And it is reached by moving from last cell of ring k-1, which is (0,k-1), in direction D0 (east) to (1,k-1)

Now, for ring k, after arriving at (1,k-1), we move in the next direction D1 for k-1 moves.

D1 = (1,-1)

So from (1,k-1), move in direction (1,-1) for k-1 steps.

Each step: add (1,-1) to the current position.

So after i steps: position = (1 + i, k-1 - i)

Since we move k-1 times, after k-1 moves, we are at (1 + (k-1), k-1 - (k-1)) = (k, 0)

So ends at (k,0)

Then next direction D2 = (0,-1), move for k steps.

From (k,0), move in (0,-1): so q unchanged, r decreases.

After j steps: (k, 0 - j)

After k steps: (k, -k)

Then next direction D3 = (-1,0), move west.

From (k,-k), move in (-1,0): so q decreases.

After m steps: (k - m, -k)

After k steps: (0, -k)

Then next direction D4 = (-1,1), move southwest.

From (0,-k), move in (-1,1): so q decreases, r increases.

After p steps: (0 - p, -k + p)

After k steps: (-k, 0)

Then next direction D5 = (0,1), move south.

From (-k,0), move in (0,1): r increases.

After q steps: (-k, 0 + q)

After k steps: (-k, k)

Then next direction D0 = (1,0), move east.

From (-k,k), move in (1,0): q increases.

After r steps: (-k + r, k)

After k steps: (0, k)

Which matches the end point.

Now, the cells are traversed in this path.

The number of cells: total 6k cells.

The index m in the ring, from 0 to 6k-1.

m=0: at (1,k-1)

Then after each move, we go to the next cell.

The path is divided into segments:

1. From m=0 to m=k-1: moving in D1 from (1,k-1) to (k,0)

The cells: start at (1,k-1), after first move to (2,k-2), then (3,k-3), ..., after (k-1) moves to (k,0)

So the cells are: for i=0 to k-1: (1+i, k-1-i)

m=i for i=0 to k-1: cell (1+i, k-1-i)

At i=0: (1,k-1)

i=1: (2,k-2)

...

i=k-1: (k,0)

Yes.

Then next segment: moving in D2 for k steps, from (k,0) to (k,-k)

Start at (k,0), after first move to (k,-1), then (k,-2), ..., after k moves to (k,-k)

So cells: for j=0 to k: (k, -j)

j=0: (k,0), j=1: (k,-1), ..., j=k: (k,-k)

But m starts after the previous segment.

After the first segment, we are at m=k-1: (k,0)

Then we move to the next cell: first move in D2 to (k,-1), which is m=k

Then to (k,-2): m=k+1, ..., to (k,-k): m=k + k = 2k? Let's see.

After arriving at (k,0) at m=k-1, then we move to (k,-1) at m=k, (k,-2) at m=k+1, ..., (k,-k) at m=k + k? From (k,0) to (k,-k) is k moves? Positions: from r=0 to r=-k, delta r=-k, each move decreases r by 1, so k moves.

So cells: m = k, k+1, ..., k + k - 1? Start at m=k: (k,-1)? No.

When we move from current position to new position, m increases.

At the start of the segment, we are at (k,0), which is already occupied by m=k-1? Earlier at end of first segment, m=k-1 at (k,0)

Then we move to the next cell: first move to (k,-1), which is m=k

Then to (k,-2): m=k+1

...

To (k,-k): after k moves? From (k,0) to (k,-1) is move 1, to (k,-2) move 2, ..., to (k,-k) is after k moves, since r decreases from 0 to -k, so k steps, so m increases from k to k + k - 1? After t moves, m = (k-1) + t

After t=1 move, m = (k-1) + 1 = k, position (k,-1)

After t=2, m=k+1, (k,-2)

...

After t=k, m=k-1 + k = 2k-1, position (k,-k)

So cells: for t=1 to k: m = k-1 + t, position (k, -t)

When t=1, m=k, pos (k,-1)

t=2, m=k+1, (k,-2)

...

t=k, m=2k-1, (k,-k)

But at t=k, r=-k, yes.

Now, next segment: from (k,-k) to (0,-k) in D3=(-1,0)

Start at (k,-k), m=2k-1

Move to (k-1,-k): m=2k

Then to (k-2,-k): m=2k+1

...

To (0,-k): after k moves? From q=k to q=0, delta q=-k, each move decreases q by 1, so k moves.

After t moves: m = (2k-1) + t, position (k - t, -k)

t=1: m=2k, pos (k-1,-k)

t=2: m=2k+1, (k-2,-k)

...

t=k: m=2k-1 + k = 3k-1, pos (0,-k)

Now next segment: from (0,-k) to (-k,0) in D4=(-1,1)

Start at (0,-k), m=3k-1

Move to (-1,-k+1): since delta q=-1, delta r=+1

Position: q decreases, r increases.

After t moves: position (0 - t, -k + t) = (-t, -k + t)

After k moves: (-k, 0)

m = (3k-1) + t

t=1: m=3k, pos (-1, -k+1)

t=2: m=3k+1, (-2,-k+2)

...

t=k: m=3k-1 + k = 4k-1, pos (-k, 0)

Next segment: from (-k,0) to (-k,k) in D5=(0,1)

Start at (-k,0), m=4k-1

Move to (-k,1): m=4k

Then to (-k,2): m=4k+1

...

To (-k,k): after k moves? r from 0 to k, delta r=k, each move increases r by 1, so k moves.

After t moves: m=4k-1 + t, position (-k, t)

t=1: m=4k, pos (-k,1)

t=2: m=4k+1, (-k,2)

...

t=k: m=4k-1 + k = 5k-1, pos (-k,k)

Last segment: from (-k,k) to (0,k) in D0=(1,0)

Start at (-k,k), m=5k-1

Move to (-k+1,k): m=5k

Then to (-k+2,k): m=5k+1

...

To (0,k): after k moves? q from -k to 0, delta q=k, each move increases q by 1, so k moves.

After t moves: m=5k-1 + t, position (-k + t, k)

t=1: m=5k, pos (-k+1,k)

t=2: m=5k+1, (-k+2,k)

...

t=k: m=5k-1 + k = 6k-1, pos (0,k)

Which is the end.

Now, summarize for ring k, index m from 0 to 6k-1:

- For m in [0, k-1]: segment 1, D1: q = 1 + m, r = k - 1 - m

- For m in [k, 2k-1]: segment 2, D2: q = k, r = -(m - k + 1) ? Earlier: position (k, -t) with t = m - (k-1) ? From earlier: for m in [k, 2k-1], position (k, - (m - k + 1) ) ? When m=k, r= -1? But should be -1, yes. m=k, r= -1? Earlier t=m - (k-1)? At m=k, t= k - (k-1) =1, r=-t= -1, yes. But r= - (m - k + 1) ? m-k+1= k-k+1=1, r=-1, yes. But for m=2k-1, r= - ( (2k-1) - k + 1) = - (k) , yes r=-k.

So q=k, r= - (m - k + 1)

Since m - k +1 ranges from 1 to k, r= -j where j=1 to k.

r = - (m - k + 1)

- For m in [2k, 3k-1]: segment 3, D3: q = k - (m - 2k) ? Earlier: position (k - t, -k) with t = m - (2k -1) ? At m=2k, t= m - (2k -1) ? 2k - (2k-1)=1, q=k-1, r=-k

After t moves, q = k - t, but t starts from 1? When t=1, q=k-1, m=2k

So q = k - (m - 2k + 1)? m-2k+1: at m=2k, 1, q=k-1? But should be k-1? k - (m - 2k + 1) = k - m + 2k -1 = 3k - m -1? At m=2k, 3k - 2k -1=k-1, yes.

But earlier: q = k - t, t = m - (2k -1) ? At m=2k, t=2k - (2k-1)=1, q=k-1

At m=3k-1, t=(3k-1)-(2k-1)=k, q=k-k=0

So q = k - (m - (2k - 1)) = k - m + 2k -1 = 3k - m -1

r = -k

- For m in [3k, 4k-1]: segment 4, D4: position (-t, -k + t) with t = m - (3k -1) ? At m=3k, t=3k - (3k-1)=1, pos (-1, -k+1)

After t moves: q= -t, r= -k + t

So q = - (m - (3k -1)) ? m - (3k -1) at m=3k is 1, q=-1

At m=4k-1, t= (4k-1) - (3k-1) = k, q=-k, r=0

So q = - (m - 3k + 1)

r = -k + (m - 3k + 1) = m - 4k + 1? At m=3k, r=3k-4k+1= -k+1, yes.

r = (m - 3k + 1) - k ? Better: r = -k + t = -k + (m - (3k -1)) = -k + m - 3k +1 = m - 4k +1

- For m in [4k, 5k-1]: segment 5, D5: position (-k, t) with t = m - (4k -1) ? At m=4k, t=4k - (4k-1)=1, pos (-k,1)

After t moves: q=-k, r=t

So r = m - (4k -1) ? At m=4k, r=1? But should be 1, yes. At m=5k-1, r=(5k-1)-(4k-1)=k, yes.

q = -k

- For m in [5k, 6k-1]: segment 6, D0: position (-k + t, k) with t = m - (5k -1) ? At m=5k, t=5k - (5k-1)=1, pos (-k+1,k)

After t moves: q= -k + t, r=k

So q = -k + (m - (5k -1)) = -k + m -5k +1 = m -6k +1

r = k

Now, for our case, k=26, n=2026.

First, the number in the ring: since ring starts at n= S(k-1) +1 = S(25) +1 =1951 +1=1952

So first cell n=1952 at m=0

n increases with m, so for a given n, m = n - 1952

Then n=2026, so m=2026 - 1952 = 74

Now m=74, k=26

Now find which segment m is in.

Segments:

0: [0, k-1] = [0,25]

1: [k, 2k-1] = [26,51]

2: [2k, 3k-1] = [52,77] ? 3*26-1=78-1=77

3: [3k, 4k-1] = [78,103]? 4*26-1=104-1=103

4: [4k, 5k-1] = [104,129]? 5*26-1=130-1=129

5: [5k, 6k-1] = [130,155]? 6*26-1=156-1=155

m=74 is in [52,77], which is segment 2: D3, m in [2k, 3k-1] = [52,77]

For this segment, q = 3k - m -1 ? Earlier: q = 3k - m -1

r = -k

k=26, m=74

q=3*26 -74 -1=78-74-1=3

r= -26

So position (q,r) = (3,-26)

Now, we need the six neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors are at:

(q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)

So for (3,-26):

N1: (4,-26)

N2: (2,-26)

N3: (3,-25)

N4: (3,-27)

N5: (4,-27)  // since q+1,r-1

N6: (2,-25)  // q-1,r+1

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

Each neighbor is in some ring, and we need to compute its n.

Since the grid is filled ring by ring, we can find for each neighbor its ring and position.

Note that the neighbors might be in the same ring or adjacent rings.

The cell (3,-26) is in ring k=26, since max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=max(|3|,|-26|,|3+26|=|29|)=max(3,26,29)=29? But earlier we said ring k has max | | =k, but here max is 29, but k=26? Inconsistency.

Mistake.

The ring number is determined by the hex distance from center.

Hex distance d = (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, with s=-q-r.

For (q,r)=(3,-26), s= -3 -(-26)= -3+26=23

|q|=3, |r|=26, |s|=23

Sum |q|+|r|+|s|=3+26+23=52, distance d=52/2=26, yes, ring 26.

Now neighbors:

N1: (4,-26), s= -4 -(-26)= -4+26=22, |q|=4,|r|=26,|s|=22, sum=4+26+22=52, d=26, same ring.

N2: (2,-26), s= -2 -(-26)=24, |q|=2,|r|=26,|s|=24, sum=2+26+24=52, d=26, same ring.

N3: (3,-25), s= -3 -(-25)=22, |q|=3,|r|=25,|s|=22, sum=3+25+22=50, d=25, ring 25.

N4: (3,-27), s= -3 -(-27)=24, |q|=3,|r|=27,|s|=24, sum=3+27+24=54, d=27, ring 27.

N5: (4,-27), s= -4 -(-27)=23, |q|=4,|r|=27,|s|=23, sum=4+27+23=54, d=27, ring 27.

N6: (2,-25), s= -2 -(-25)=23, |q|=2,|r|=25,|s|=23, sum=2+25+23=50, d=25, ring 25.

So neighbors in ring 25: N3 and N6: (3,-25) and (2,-25)

In ring 26: N1 and N2: (4,-26) and (2,-26)

In ring 27: N4 and N5: (3,-27) and (4,-27)

Now, we need to find the number n for each.

Since the rings are filled in order, we can compute for each neighbor its position and find m in its ring.

First, for neighbors in same ring 26: N1: (4,-26), N2: (2,-26)

Both in ring k=26.

We have m for our cell: m=74 at (3,-26)

Now, for N1: (4,-26)

Which segment is it in?

We need to find m for (4,-26) in ring 26.

From the segments:

Segment 1: m in [0,25], q=1+m, r=k-1-m=26-1-m=25-m

Set q=4, r=-26? But r=25-m, which for m<=25, r>=0? But here r=-26<0, so not in seg1.

Segment 2: m in [26,51], q=k=26, r= -(m - k +1) = -(m -26 +1)= -m +25? Earlier r= -(m - k +1)

Set q=26? But here q=4≠26, so not.

Segment 3: m in [52,77], q=3k - m -1=3*26 -m -1=78-m-1=77-m

r=-k=-26

Set r=-26, good.

q=77-m

Set q=4, so 77-m=4 ⇒ m=77-4=73

Now m=73, which is in [52,77], yes.

So for (4,-26), m=73 in ring 26.

Similarly, for N2: (2,-26)

Same segment? q=77-m=2 ⇒ 77-m=2 ⇒ m=75

r=-26, same.

m=75 in [52,77], yes.

Now, for neighbors in ring 25: N3: (3,-25), N6: (2,-25)

Ring k=25.

First, ring 25 starts at n= S(24) +1

S(k)=3k(k+1)+1

S(24)=3*24*25 +1=3*600+1=1800+1=1801

So ring 25: n=1802 to S(25)=3*25*26 +1=3*650+1=1950+1=1951

First cell at (1,25-1)=(1,24)

Now, for (3,-25), find m in ring 25.

Segments for k=25:

Seg1: m in [0,24], q=1+m, r=25-1-m=24-m

Set? q=3, r=-25

r=24-m, which is >=0 for m<=24, but r=-25<0, not seg1.

Seg2: m in [25,49], q=k=25, r= -(m -25 +1)= -m +24? r= -(m - k +1)= -(m-25+1)= -m+24

Set q=25? But here q=3≠25, no.

Seg3: m in [50,74], q=3k -m -1=3*25 -m -1=75-m-1=74-m

r=-k=-25

Set r=-25, good.

q=74-m

Set q=3, so 74-m=3 ⇒ m=71

Now m=71 in [50,74]? 50 to 74 inclusive, yes, 71 is in.

So m=71 for (3,-25)

Similarly, for N6: (2,-25)

Same segment? q=74-m=2 ⇒ 74-m=2 ⇒ m=72

r=-25, same.

m=72 in [50,74], yes.

Now for neighbors in ring 27: N4: (3,-27), N5: (4,-27)

Ring k=27.

Starts at n=S(26)+1=2107+1=2108? S(26)=3*26*27+1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107, yes, so n=2108 to S(27)=3*27*28+1=3*756+1=2268+1=2269

First cell at (1,27-1)=(1,26)

Now for (3,-27), find m in ring 27.

Segments:

Seg1: m in [0,26], q=1+m, r=27-1-m=26-m

Set? q=3, r=-27

r=26-m >=0? But r=-27<0, not seg1.

Seg2: m in [27,53], q=k=27, r= -(m -27 +1)= -m +26? r= -(m - k +1)= -(m-27+1)= -m+26

Set q=27? But q=3≠27, no.

Seg3: m in [54,80], q=3k -m -1=3*27 -m -1=81-m-1=80-m

r=-k=-27

Set r=-27, good.

q=80-m

Set q=3, so 80-m=3 ⇒ m=77

Now m=77 in [54,80]? 54 to 80 inclusive, yes.

Similarly, for N5: (4,-27)

Same segment, q=80-m=4 ⇒ 80-m=4 ⇒ m=76

r=-27, same.

m=76 in [54,80], yes.

Now, we have the m indices for each neighbor in their respective rings.

Now, the number n is the start of ring plus m.

For ring 26 neighbors: N1: (4,-26), m=73, ring starts at n=1952, so n=1952 + 73 = 2025

N2: (2,-26), m=75, n=1952 + 75 = 2027

For ring 25 neighbors: N3: (3,-25), m=71, ring 25 starts at n=1802, so n=1802 + 71 = 1873

N6: (2,-25), m=72, n=1802 + 72 = 1874

For ring 27 neighbors: N4: (3,-27), m=77, ring 27 starts at n=2108, so n=2108 + 77 = 2185

N5: (4,-27), m=76, n=2108 + 76 = 2184

Now, sum of neighbors: n_N1 + n_N2 + n_N3 + n_N4 + n_N5 + n_N6

= 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2185 + 2184

Now compute step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2185 + 2184 = 4369

Now sum these: 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Let me add carefully.

4052 + 3747:

4000+3700=7700

52+47=99

7700+99=7799

Then 7799 + 4369:

7799 + 4000 = 11799

11799 + 369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099 + 69 = 12168

So sum is 12168.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a small example.

Take the center n=1, neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum=2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

Now compute with method.

For n=1, ring k=0, but neighbors are in ring1.

Our cell is (0,0), neighbors: (1,0):2, (-1,0):5, (0,1):7, (0,-1):4, (1,-1):3, (-1,1):6

All in ring1.

Ring1: k=1, starts at n=2? S(0)=1, so ring1: n=2 to7.

First cell (1,0):2

Now for neighbor (1,0): in ring1, position (1,0)

Segments for k=1:

Seg1: m in [0,0] (since k-1=0), q=1+m=1+0=1, r=k-1-m=1-1-0=0? r=0

But (1,0) is here.

m=0

n= start + m =2 +0=2, correct.

Neighbor (-1,0): q=-1,r=0

Seg? Seg3: m in [2k,3k-1]=[2,2]? k=1, [2,0]? Not.

Seg1: m in [0,0], q=1+m=1, r=0, not (-1,0)

Seg2: m in [k,2k-1]=[1,1], q=k=1, r= -(m-k+1)= -(m-1+1)= -m

Set q=1? But here q=-1≠1, no.

Seg3: m in [2,0]? [2k,3k-1]=[2,0]? But 2>0, empty? Problem.

For k=1, segments:

Seg1: m=0 to 0: (q,r)=(1+0,1-1-0)=(1,0)

Seg2: m in [1,1], q=k=1, r= -(m-k+1)= -(m-1+1)= -m

At m=1, r=-1, so (1,-1)

Seg3: m in [2,0]? [2k,3k-1]=[2,0]? Invalid since 2>0.

But we have more cells.

For k=1, total cells 6, m=0 to5.

Seg1: m=0: (1,0)

Seg2: m=1: (1,-1) ? Earlier for seg2: q=k=1, r= -(m-k+1)= -(m-1+1)= -m, at m=1, r=-1, so (1,-1)

But next should be seg3: but m=2? Seg3: m in [2,2]? [2k,3k-1]=[2,0]? Not defined.

From earlier path: after seg1: at (1,0), m=0

Then move to (1,-1) in D2? But for seg2, we have m=1: (1,-1)

Then next should be to (0,-1) in D3, which is seg3.

For seg3: m in [2,2]? Since 3k-1=2 for k=1.

q=3k -m -1=3*1 -m -1=2-m

r=-k=-1

At m=2, q=2-2=0, r=-1, so (0,-1)

Then seg4: m in [3,3]? [3k,4k-1]=[3,3]

q= -(m -3k +1)? Earlier q= -(m -3k +1)

r= m -4k +1

k=1, q= -(m -3+1)= -(m-2)

r=m-4+1=m-3

At m=3, q= -(3-2)= -1, r=3-3=0, so (-1,0)

Seg5: m in [4,4], q=-k=-1, r=m - (4k -1)? Earlier r= m - (4k -1) ? For seg5: r= m - (4k -1)

k=1, r=m - (4-1)=m-3

q=-k=-1

At m=4, r=4-3=1, q=-1, so (-1,1)

Seg6: m in [5,5], q= m -6k +1= m-6+1=m-5

r=k=1

At m=5, q=5-5=0, r=1, so (0,1)

Perfect.

So for k=1, neighbors:

(1,0): m=0, n=2+0=2

(-1,0): in seg4, m=3, n=2+3=5? Start n=2, m=0 to5, n=2+m

So at m=3, n=5

(0,1): seg6, m=5, n=7

(0,-1): seg3, m=2, n=4

(1,-1): seg2, m=1, n=3

(-1,1): seg5, m=4, n=6

Sum:2+5+7+4+3+6= let's see: 2+5=7, +7=14, +4=18, +3=21, +6=27, correct.

Now back to our problem.

We have for n=2026 at (3,-26) in ring26, m=74

Neighbors:

N1: (4,-26) ring26, m=73, n=1952+73=2025

N2: (2,-26) ring26, m=75, n=1952+75=2027

N3: (3,-25) ring25, m=71, n=1802+71=1873

N4: (3,-27) ring27, m=77, n=2108+77=2185

N5: (4,-27) ring27, m=76, n=2108+76=2184

N6: (2,-25) ring25, m=72, n=1802+72=1874

Sum: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2185 + 2184 = 4369

Now 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

As before.

But let me confirm the numbers.

Ring25 start: S(24)=3*24*25+1=3*600+1=1800+1=1801, so first n=1802

m=71: n=1802+71=1873

m=72:1802+72=1874

Ring26 start: S(25)=3*25*26+1=3*650+1=1950+1=1951, so first n=1952

m=73:1952+73=2025

m=75:1952+75=2027

Ring27 start: S(26)=3*26*27+1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107, so first n=2108

m=76:2108+76=2184

m=77:2108+77=2185

Now sum: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874: 1870+1870=3740, 3+4=7, total 3747? 1873+1874=1873+1800+74=3673+74=3747, yes.

2184+2185=2184+2180+5=4364+5=4369? 2184+2185=4369, yes.

Now 4052 + 3747: 4000+3700=7700, 52+47=99, 7700+99=7799

7799 + 4369: 7799 + 4000=11799, 11799 + 369=11799 + 300=12099, +69=12168.

So sum is 12168.

But the problem asks for the sum of the six neighbors, and we have it.

Now, is this correct? In the center, it worked, but let's check for another cell.

For example, take n=2 at (1,0)

Neighbors: should include 1,3,8? From earlier grid.

(1,0): neighbors: (2,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(0,0),(0,1),(-1,1)? But (0,0):1, (1,-1):3, (0,1):7, etc.

In the grid: adjacent to (0,0):1, (2,0):? in ring2, (1,1):8? (1,-1):3, (0,1):7, (0,-1)? (0,-1):4, but not directly adjacent? Distance: from (1,0) to (0,-1): dq=-1, dr=-1, ds= -(-1)-(-1)=1+1=2? |dq|=1,|dr|=1,|ds|=2, sum=4, dist=2, not adjacent. Only neighbors at dist 1.

Standard neighbors: (q+1,r)=(2,0), (q-1,r)=(0,0), (q,r+1)=(1,1), (q,r-1)=(1,-1), (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1)? (1+1,0-1)=(2,-1), (q-1,r+1)=(0,1)

So neighbors: (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,-1)? (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1), and (q-1,r+1)=(0,1)

But (2,-1) and (0,1) are not in ring1; ring1 has only up to dist1.

(0,0) is center, others: (2,0) dist |2|+|0|+| -2|=4, dist2; similarly (1,1) dist |1|+|1|+| -2|=4, dist2; (1,-1) dist1, already; (0,1) dist1.

So neighbors: (0,0):1, (1,-1):3, (0,1):7, and also (2,0)? But dist2, not adjacent.

In hex grid, adjacent only if dist exactly 1.

So for (1,0), neighbors: (1+1,0)=(2,0) dist |2|+0+| -2|=4>1? |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2, sum=4, dist=2, not adjacent.

Similarly, (1-1,0)=(0,0) dist0? But |0|+0+|0|=0, dist0, but adjacent? Distance 0 is itself, not neighbor.

Distance must be 1.

So neighbors: (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1)? Earlier vectors: neighbors are (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)

So for (1,0): (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,-1), (0,1)

Now compute dist:

(2,0): |2|+|0|+| -2|=4, dist2

(0,0): dist0

(1,1): |1|+|1|+| -2|=4, dist2

(1,-1): |1|+|1|+|0|=2, dist1

(2,-1): |2|+|1|+| -1|=4, dist2? |s|=|-1|=1, sum=2+1+1=4? |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=|-2-(-1)|? s=-q-r=-2-(-1)=-1, |s|=1, sum=2+1+1=4, dist2

(0,1): |0|+|1|+| -1|=2, dist1

So only dist1 neighbors are (1,-1) and (0,1)? But should be six.

I think I missed some.

Standard: the six neighbors are:

- East: (q+1,r)

- West: (q-1,r)

- Northeast: (q+1,r-1) ? Earlier I have (q+1,r-1)

But for (1,0), (q+1,r)=(2,0), dist2

(q-1,r)=(0,0), dist0

(q,r+1)=(1,1), dist2

(q,r-1)=(1,-1), dist1

(q+1,r-1)=(2,-1), dist2

(q-1,r+1)=(0,1), dist1

But only two at dist1: (1,-1) and (0,1), but should be more.

What about (q,r) itself? No.

I recall that in axial coordinates, the neighbors are indeed those six, but for (1,0), let's compute distance to (0,0): |1-0| + |0-0| + |s1-s2|? Distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2, but ds depends.

Distance between (q1,r1) and (q2,r2) is (|q1-q2| + |r1-r2| + |s1-s2|)/2, with s1=-q1-r1, s2=-q2-r2.

So |s1-s2|=| -q1-r1 +q2+r2|=| (q2-q1) + (r2-r1) |

For (1,0) and (1,-1): dq=0, dr=-1, ds=| -1-0 -(-1-(-1)) | s1=-1-0=-1, s2=-1-(-1)=0? s2 for (1,-1): s=-1-(-1)=0? Earlier s=-q-r.

(1,-1): q=1,r=-1,s=-1-(-1)=0? |s|=0

(1,0): q=1,r=0,s=-1-0=-1, |s|=1

d to (1,-1): |1-1| + |0-(-1)| + | -1 - 0 | ? |s1-s2|=|-1 - 0|=1? But s1=-1, s2=0? For (1,-1), s=-q-r=-1-(-1)=0, yes.

So |dq|=0, |dr|=1, |ds|=1, sum=2, dist=1, adjacent.

Similarly, to (0,1): |1-0| + |0-1| + |s1-s2|, s1=-1, s2=-0-1=-1, |s1-s2|=0, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, sum=1+1+0=2, dist=1.

To (0,0): |1-0|+|0-0|+| -1 - 0|=1+0+1=2, dist=1? |s1-s2|=|-1-0|=1, yes, dist=1.

(0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), yes.

To (2,0): |1-2|+|0-0|+| -1 - (-2)| | s1=-1, s2=-2-0=-2, |s1-s2|=|-1-(-2)|=1, |dq|=1, |dr|=0, sum=1+0+1=2, dist=1? But earlier I thought dist2, but |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2? For (2,0), s=-2-0=-2, |s|=2, but distance to (1,0): |2-1|+|0-0|+| -2 - (-1)| = |1|+|0|+| -1|=1+0+1=2, dist=1? Dist is sum/2? Earlier I defined dist as (|dq|+|dr|+|ds|)/2, so 2/2=1, yes dist1.

I miscounted earlier. For (2,0), dist to (0,0) is |2|+|0|+| -2|=4? |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=|-2-0|=2? s=-q-r=-2-0=-2, |s|=2, sum=2+0+2=4, dist=2.

But to (1,0): |2-1|+|0-0|+| -2 - (-1)| = |1|+|0|+| -1|=1+0+1=2, dist=1, yes adjacent.

Similarly, (1,1): |1-1|+|0-1|+| -1 - (-2)| s1 for (1,0):-1, s2 for (1,1):-1-1=-2, |s1-s2|=|-1-(-2)|=1, |dq|=0, |dr|=1, sum=0+1+1=2, dist=1.

So neighbors of (1,0) are: (0,0):1, (2,0):? number, (1,1):? (1,-1):3, (0,1):7, and (2,-1)? (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1), dist: |2-1|+|-1-0|+| -2 - (-1)| s1=-1, s2=-2-(-1)=-1, |s1-s2|=0, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, sum=1+1+0=2, dist=1, yes.

In the grid, what are the numbers: (0,0):1, (1,-1):3, (0,1):7, (2,0):9? In ring2, (1,1):8, (2,-1):10? But (2,-1) is in ring2.

So neighbors: 1 (center), 3 (ring1), 7 (ring1), and 8 (ring2), 9 (ring2), 10? (2,-1):10

But (2,0):9, (1,1):8, (2,-1):10, all ring2.

So numbers: 1,3,7,8,9,10? Sum=1+3+7+8+9+10=38? But earlier for center it was 27, now different.

In the snippet, around 2: in middle row, 2 is at (1,0), left is (0,0):1? But in snippet: middle row: x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

So left of 2 is 1? But (0,0) is left? If x is column, at same y, so (0,0) is adjacent horizontally? In hex grid, horizontally adjacent if same y, |dx|=1.

In our axial, same r? But q different.

At (1,0) and (0,0), same r? r=0, q differs by 1, so yes adjacent horizontally.

In snippet, to the left of 2 is 1, so adjacent.

Above: top row has at x=1,y=-1:3, and x=0,y=-1:4, so probably above-left is 3, above-right is 4? But directly above might not be.

Neighbors: left: (0,0):1, right: (2,0):9? But in snippet, to the right is 9? But 9 is at x=2,y=0, same row.

But also, diagonally: above-left: (1,-1):3? Which is at x=1,y=-1, top row.

Above-right: (0,-1)? But (0,-1) is above center, at x=0,y=-1:4.

But (0,-1) is adjacent to (1,0)? |q1-q2|=|1-0|=1, |r1-r2|=|0-(-1)|=1, s1=-1, s2=-0-(-1)=1? |s1-s2|=|-1-1|=2, sum=1+1+2=4, dist=2, not adjacent.

Adjacent should be only (1,-1):3, which is above-left, and below: (1,1):8? Bottom row, at x=1,y=1:8, and (0,1):7? At x=0,y=1:7.

Now, (1,1):8 and (0,1):7.

Dist to (1,0): to (1,1): |1-1|+|1-0|+| -2 - (-1)| s1=-1, s2=-1-1=-2, |s1-s2|=1, |dq|=0,|dr|=1,sum=1,dist=0.5? Sum=0+1+1=2, dist=1, yes.

Similarly to (0,1): |1-0|+|0-1|+| -1 - (-1)| =1+1+0=2,dist=1.

So neighbors: left: (0,0):1, right: (2,0):9, above-left: (1,-1):3, below-left: (0,1):7? Below-right: (1,1):8? 

The six: 

- East: (2,0):9? But in axial, east might be (q+1,r)=(2,0)

But in the grid, to the right is (2,0):9, same row.

Then northeast: (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1):10? At x=2,y=-1? Top row, but in snippet top row has x=2:10, yes.

Southeast: (q,r+1)=(1,1):8? Bottom row x=1,y=1:8

Southwest: (q-1,r+1)=(0,1):7? Bottom row x=0,y=1:7

West: (q-1,r)=(0,0):1

Northwest: (q,r-1)=(1,-1):3? But (q,r-1)=(1,-1), which is above, but in hex, northwest might be different.

In any case, the neighbors are: (0,0):1, (2,0):9, (1,-1):3, (1,1):8, (2,-1):10, and (0,1):7? But (0,1) is also adjacent.

List: (q-1,r)=(0,0):1

(q+1,r)=(2,0):9

(q,r-1)=(1,-1):3

(q,r+1)=(1,1):8

(q+1,r-1)=(2,-1):10

(q-1,r+1)=(0,1):7

All distinct, and in grid: 1,9,3,8,10,7

Sum: 1+9=10, +3=13, +8=21, +10=31, +7=38

In our calculation for n=2, we have neighbors 1,3,7,8,9,10 sum 38.

But in our method, we computed for n=2026, but for n=2, if we compute, but we don't need, but just to verify the method.

In our case for n=2026, we have neighbors including numbers in different rings, and we computed their positions and numbers correctly.

Since the neighbors are symmetric in some way, but in this case, we have computed all six.

So sum is 12168.

But let me confirm if for n=2026 itself, we have correct position.

n=2026 in ring26, start n=1952, m=2026-1952=74

k=26

In segment: m=74 in [52,77]? 2k=52, 3k-1=78-1=77, yes, segment 3.

q=3k -m -1=3*26 -74 -1=78-74-1=3

r=-k=-26, so (3,-26), as before.

Neighbors computed.

Sum is 12168.

So the answer should be 12168.

But let me write it down.

Neighbors:

N1: (4,-26) n=2025

N2: (2,-26) n=2027

N3: (3,-25) n=1873

N4: (3,-27) n=2185

N5: (4,-27) n=2184

N6: (2,-25) n=1874

Sum: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

To add all: 2025+2027+1873+1874+2184+2185

Group: (2025+2185) + (2027+2184) + (1873+1874) = 4210 + 4211 + 3747

4210+4211=8421

8421+3747=8421+3700=12121, +47=12168

Same.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position \((q, r) = (3, -26)\) in ring 26 of the hexagonal spiral. The six neighbors of this cell are at positions \((4, -26)\), \((2, -26)\), \((3, -25)\), \((3, -27)\), \((4, -27)\), and \((2, -25)\).

- The neighbor at \((4, -26)\) is in ring 26. The ring starts at number 1952, and the index \(m\) in the ring is 73, so the number is \(1952 + 73 = 2025\).
- The neighbor at \((2, -26)\) is in ring 26. The index \(m\) is 75, so the number is \(1952 + 75 = 2027\).
- The neighbor at \((3, -25)\) is in ring 25. The ring starts at number 1802, and the index \(m\) is 71, so the number is \(1802 + 71 = 1873\).
- The neighbor at \((3, -27)\) is in ring 27. The ring starts at number 2108, and the index \(m\) is 77, so the number is \(2108 + 77 = 2185\).
- The neighbor at \((4, -27)\) is in ring 27. The index \(m\) is 76, so the number is \(2108 + 76 = 2184\).
- The neighbor at \((2, -25)\) is in ring 25. The index \(m\) is 72, so the number is \(1802 + 72 = 1874\).

The sum of the neighbors is calculated as follows:
\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052
\]
\[
1873 + 1874 = 3747
\]
\[
2184 + 2185 = 4369
\]
\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799
\]
\[
7799 + 4369 = 12168
\]

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

\boxed{12168}
