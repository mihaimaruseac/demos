<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand the spiral's layout.

From the example:

- ... 14 4 3 10 ...

- .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

- ... 16 6 7 8 ...

This seems messy. Let me sketch this out. It appears that 1 is at the center, surrounded by numbers. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. So, for 1, its neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7? Looking at the grid:

In the middle row: 15,5,1,2,9

Above: 14,4,3,10? But 14 and 10 are mentioned, but probably not all neighbors.

Perhaps it's better to list the neighbors of 1. From the grid, 1 is adjacent to 2,9? But 2 is next to it, and 5 is above? The arrangement is not clear.

Maybe I should reconstruct the spiral. Typically, in hexagonal spirals, it starts at the center and spirals outward.

Assume that 1 is at the center. Then, moving in some direction, it places 2,3,4, etc.

From the given snippet, around 1, we have 2 to the right, 5 above, and probably 6 below or something.

Look at the numbers: 1 is surrounded by 2,5, and others. In the row below: 16,6,7,8. So 6,7,8 are below.

But 7 and 8 are next to each other. Perhaps the neighbors of 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7? But 3 and 4 are above? In the top row: 14,4,3,10. So 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other.

Let me try to arrange the cells. Since it's a hexagonal grid, the rows are offset, like a honeycomb.

In a hexagonal grid, rows can be horizontal or vertical. From the given, it seems rows are horizontal, but staggered.

Look at the positions:

Row 1 (top): ... 14 4 3 10 ... — probably cells are adjacent.

Row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ... — so 15,5,1,2,9

Row 3: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

Assuming that directly above 1 is 5, since in row 2, 5 is left of 1, but in hexagonal grid, directly above might be different.

In standard hexagonal grid with horizontal rows, each row is offset by half a cell.

So, for example, cell (x,y) has neighbors at (x±1,y), (x,y±1), but with offsets.

To make it easier, I can assign coordinates.

Set center at (0,0) for number 1.

Then, typically, in such spirals, it moves in six directions.

I recall that hexagonal grids can be represented with axial coordinates or cube coordinates.

But perhaps for this problem, I can find a pattern or formula for the spiral.

I know that in many spirals, like Ulam spiral, but hexagonal is less common.

Perhaps I can find which "layer" 2026 is in.

Start from center: layer 0: just 1.

Layer 1: numbers around it, probably 2 through 7, since six neighbors.

In the given, after 1, we have 2, then probably 3,4,5,6,7.

From the grid: after 1 is 2 (to the right), then below 2 is 9? But 9 seems larger, so perhaps not.

Look at the sequence: 1, then 2, then 3,4, etc? But in the bottom row, 6,7,8, so 7 and 8 are after 6.

List the numbers in order.

Start at 1.

Then, moving to the next cell. From the grid, to the right of 1 is 2, so probably 2 is placed next.

Then, from 2, it might go down or something. Below 2 is 7? In row 3: 6,7,8, so 7 is below 2? But 6 is left of 7.

Perhaps the spiral goes: after 1, it places 2 to the east, then 3 to the northeast, but in hexagonal, directions are different.

Assume the spiral moves in a counter-clockwise or clockwise direction.

From 1, it moves to 2 (say east), then from 2, it might move southeast to 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 5, and 4 and 3 are to the left.

In row 1: 4,3,10 — so 3 and 4 are together.

In row 2: 5,1,2

So probably, above 1 is 5, to the right is 2, and to the left might be 15? But 15 is larger, so not neighbor.

The neighbors of 1 should be the six adjacent cells. From the grid, what is adjacent to 1?

In hexagonal grid, cell at (0,0) has neighbors at (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) or something. I need to define the coordinate system.

Let me define axial coordinates (q,r).

Set 1 at (0,0).

Assume that to the "east" is (1,0), "northeast" is (0,1), "northwest" is (-1,1), "west" is (-1,0), "southwest" is (0,-1), "southeast" is (1,-1). This is one common system.

The distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) but in axial, s = -q-r, so distance d = max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) but usually for hex grid, the distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) with s= -q-r, and |q| + |r| + |s| = 2d for some d, but actually for axial, the Manhattan distance is |dq| + |dr| + |ds| but ds is determined.

The shortest path distance in hex grid is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) where s = -q-r, and it's also (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2.

For example, cell (0,0): distance 0.

Neighbors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1).

Now, assign numbers to these.

From the grid, we have numbers around.

In row 2: 15,5,1,2,9 — so probably this is a row at r=0 or something.

Assume that the row with 1 is r=0. Then cells at r=0: ...15,5,1,2,9...

So at q= -2:15, q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9? But in axial, for r=0, q can be any, but neighbors are not all on same r.

For cell (0,0), neighbors are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1).

In the grid, we see at r=0: q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2.

Above, row r=1: cells with r=1, q from -1 to 1 or something. From the top row: 14,4,3,10. Probably r=1: q=-1:14? q=0:4? q=1:3? q=2:10? But 14 and 10 are larger, so perhaps not.

Notice that 4 and 3 are small, so likely neighbors of 1.

Probably (0,1) is 4 or 3, (-1,1) is something.

Assume that from 1, moving northeast to (0,1) is 4, but in the grid, above 1 is 5, which is at (-1,0), since in same row.

In row r=0: q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2.

Now, the cell directly above 1: in hexagonal grid with horizontal rows, the cell above is at (0,1) or (-1,1)? It depends on the offset.

If rows are offset, for even r, q integer, for odd r, q half-integer or something, but usually in axial, q and r are integers, and the grid is such that for each r, q varies, and cells are staggered.

For cell at (0,0), the neighbor at "north" could be (0,1) or (-1,1), depending on the orientation.

In the given grid, in the top row, we have 14,4,3,10, and 4 and 3 are likely neighbors of 1.

1 is at (0,0), so neighbors are (1,0):2, (0,1):? , (-1,1):? , (-1,0):5, (0,-1):? , (1,-1):? .

From the bottom row: 16,6,7,8, so probably (0,-1):6 or 7.

Assume that (1,0) is 2, as given.

(-1,0) is 5, as given.

Now, (0,1): let's say 4 or 3. In the top row, 4 and 3 are next to each other, so probably (0,1) and (1,1) or something.

Suppose (0,1) is 4, then (1,1) might be 3, but in the grid, 3 is to the right of 4? In "14 4 3 10", so 4 then 3, so if r=1, q increasing, then at q=0:4, q=1:3, but usually q increases to the right, so if 4 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1), then the neighbor at (1,1) for (0,0) is (1,0) and (0,1), but (1,1) is not a neighbor of (0,0); the neighbors are only adjacent cells.

Distance 1 cells are those with |dq|<=1, |dr|<=1, and |dq+dr|<=1? In axial coordinates, the distance is max(|q1-q2|, |r1-r2|, |s1-s2|) with s= -q-r, but for adjacent, it's when the differences are small.

Specifically, two cells are adjacent if |q1-q2| <=1, |r1-r2| <=1, and | (q1-q2) + (r1-r2) | <=1? I think it's when the max of |dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr| is 1, but actually for adjacent, the hexagonal distance is 1, which requires that the differences in q,r,s are 0 or 1 in magnitude with sum of absolute values 2, but perhaps it's easier to list.

For cell (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)? Let's check.

Standard axial neighbors: (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)? That's six, but (q+1,r-1) and (q-1,r+1) are diagonal in a way, but in hex grid, they are adjacent.

The vector differences are: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1).

Yes, those are the six directions.

For (0,0), neighbors: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1).

From the grid, we have:

At r=0: q=-1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2

At r=1: from "14 4 3 10", so likely q=-1:14, q=0:4, q=1:3, q=2:10? But 14 and 10 are larger, so for r=1, cells at q=0:4, q=1:3.

At r=-1: from bottom row "16 6 7 8", so q=-1:16, q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8? Or q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8, q=-1:16.

Now, for cell (0,0), its neighbors should be:

(1,0): which is in r=0,q=1: number 2

(-1,0): r=0,q=-1: number 5

(0,1): r=1,q=0: number 4

(0,-1): r=-1,q=0: number 6

(1,-1): r=-1,q=1: number 7

(-1,1): r=1,q=-1: number 14? But 14 is larger than 1, while others are small, so probably not. 14 is not a neighbor of 1; it's farther.

Mistake. ( -1,1) is at r=1,q=-1, which in the grid is 14, but 14 is not adjacent to 1; the adjacent cells should be closer.

For (0,0), ( -1,1) is a neighbor, but in the grid, at ( -1,1) is 14, but 14 is large, while the neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7 or something.

Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.

Perhaps the "north" direction is different.

Another common system is to have the "pointy-top" or "flat-top" hexagons.

In this case, from the grid, it seems that above 1 is 5, but 5 is at ( -1,0), which is west, not north.

Perhaps north is (0,1).

Let's list the neighbors of 1 from the grid.

From the arrangement, 1 is at center.

To its right is 2.

To its left is 5? But in the same row, left is 5, but in hexagonal grid, there might be cells above and below.

Above it, in the top row, there is 4 and 3, but which one is directly above?

Typically, in a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors: two in the same row (left and right), and two above-left and above-right, and two below-left and below-right, or something.

For cell 1, in row 2: it has left neighbor 5, right neighbor 2.

Then, above it, there are two cells: one is directly above, which might be 4 or 3.

In the top row, 4 and 3 are adjacent, and both are above row 2.

Since the grid is staggered, for a cell in row r, the cells in row r-1 and r+1 are offset.

For cell at position (x,y), but in this case, for cell 1 at (0,0), the cell directly above might be at (0,1), and it is 4, then the cell above-left is at (-1,1) which is 14, but 14 is not neighbor, so probably not.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Let's look at the numbers around 1.

From the grid, below 1, in row 3, there is 6 and 7. 6 is directly below? Or 7?

In row 3: 6,7,8, and 1 is above, so probably 6 is below 1, since it's directly below in the column.

In the snippet, it's written as:

Row 1: ... 14 4 3 10 ...

Row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

Row 3: ... 16 6 7 8 ...

So visually, assuming it's aligned, so that 4 is above 5, 3 is above 1, 6 is below 5, 7 is below 1, etc.

Let me align them:

Assume that the numbers are placed in columns.

Suppose column 0: in row 1: ? , row 2: 1, row 3: 7? But 7 is not directly below.

From the arrangement, let's see the positions.

In row 2, we have cells: let's say position i: cell i.

Assume that row 2 has cells at x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9.

Then row 1 above: it has cells at x= -1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10? But 14 at x= -1, which is above x= -1 of row 2, which is 5, so above 5 is 14.

Above 1 (x=0) is 4.

Above 2 (x=1) is 3.

Then row 3 below: at x= -1:16, x=0:6, x=1:7, x=2:8.

So below 5 (x= -1) is 16, below 1 (x=0) is 6, below 2 (x=1) is 7.

Now, in hexagonal grid, for cell at (x,y) = (0,2) say, but y is row.

Set y for rows. Let row 2 be y=0.

Then cell at (x,y) = (0,0): 1

Neighbors:

- right: (1,0): 2

- left: (-1,0): 5

- top-right: in row y=1, at x=1: 3

- top-left: in row y=1, at x=0: 4? But (0,1) is directly above? In hex grid, directly above might be at (0,1), but also there is top-left and top-right.

For a cell at (x,y), in a hex grid with horizontal rows, if y is even, then neighbors are (x,y-1), (x+1,y-1), (x+1,y), (x,y+1), (x-1,y+1), (x-1,y) or something. I need to define.

From the positions, for cell (0,0):

- (1,0): 2 (right)

- (-1,0): 5 (left)

- (0,1): 4 (above, since in row y=1, x=0)

- (1,1): 3 (above-right, in row y=1, x=1)

- (0,-1): 6 (below, in row y= -1, x=0)

- (-1,-1): 16? But 16 is at (-1,-1), but 16 is large, while we expect a small number.

The neighbor below-left should be at (-1,-1), but in the grid, at y= -1 (row 3), x= -1: 16, which is large, but for cell 1, the neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

7 is at (1,-1): in row y= -1, x=1: 7.

And 6 is at (0,-1): 6.

So the sixth neighbor is at (-1,1)? But (-1,1) is in row y=1, x= -1: 14, which is not a neighbor.

I see the problem: in this coordinate system, the cell at (-1,0) is 5, which is left, but the cell at (-1,1) is 14, which is not adjacent, but in hex grid, the cell at ( -1,1) should be adjacent to (0,0) if it's a neighbor.

Perhaps for cell (0,0), the neighbors are:

- (1,0): 2

- (0,1): 4

- (-1,1): ? but at (-1,1) is 14, not neighbor

- (-1,0): 5

- (0,-1): 6

- (1,-1): 7

But what about the sixth neighbor? It should be, for example, (-1,-1) or (1,1), but (1,1) is 3, which is at (1,1), and it should be adjacent to (0,0).

Is (1,1) adjacent to (0,0)? In a hex grid, yes, if it's a flat-top or pointy-top.

In this case, cell at (1,1) is 3, and it is above and to the right of 1, and in the grid, it is adjacent to 1? From the positions, 1 at (0,0), 3 at (1,1), but there is 2 at (1,0) between them, so probably not directly adjacent.

Perhaps the grid is such that cells are only adjacent if they share a side, and in this layout, cell (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)? But (1,1) might not be adjacent.

Let's think of the geometry.

In a hexagonal grid with horizontal rows, each hexagon has neighbors: two in the same row (left and right), one above-left, one above-right, one below-left, one below-right.

For cell at (x,y), with y even or odd.

In this case, for y=0 (row 2), x=0:1.

Then:

- same row left: x= -1, y=0:5

- same row right: x=1, y=0:2

- above-left: for y even, above-left might be x-0.5, but since we use integer x, perhaps when y even, above-left is (x-1,y-1)? Let's see.

Above 1, at y=1, there is x=0:4 and x=1:3.

Typically, the cell directly above might be at (0,1):4, and it is adjacent.

Then the cell at (1,1):3 is adjacent to (0,0)? But in the grid, between (0,0) and (1,1), there is (1,0):2, so probably not adjacent; they don't share a side.

In fact, for cell (0,0), it shares a side with (0,1):4, and with (1,0):2, and with ( -1,0):5, and with (0,-1):6, and with (1,-1):7? (1,-1) is at x=1,y= -1:7, and it is below-right.

And the sixth neighbor should be below-left or above-left.

Below-left: at y= -1, x= -1:16, but 16 is not adjacent.

Above-left: at y=1, x= -1:14, not adjacent.

But that can't be, because 1 must have six neighbors.

Perhaps the cell at ( -1,1) is not a neighbor, but the cell at (0,1) is, and perhaps ( -1,0) is, but what is the sixth?

Let's list the cells that share a side with 1.

From the grid, 1 is at center.

To its right is 2.

To its left is 5.

Above it is 4 (directly above).

Below it is 6 (directly below).

Then, above and to the right is 3, but 3 is at (1,1), and if it's not adjacent, then what?

Perhaps in this grid, the cell at (1,1) is adjacent to 1, but in the spiral, it is placed later, but for adjacency, it should be adjacent if it's a neighbor cell.

Perhaps for cell 1, the neighbors are 2,5,4,6, and then also 3 and 7, but 3 is at (1,1), 7 at (1,-1).

And in the grid, cell 1 shares a side with cell 3? But there is cell 2 in between, so likely not.

Unless the grid is not properly represented, or perhaps I need to see the connectivity.

Another idea: in the bottom row, we have 16,6,7,8, and 6 is below 1, 7 is below 2, so 6 and 7 are in the same row, so they are adjacent to each other.

For cell 1 at (0,0), it is adjacent to 6 at (0,-1), and also to 7 at (1,-1)? But that would mean it is adjacent to both 6 and 7, which are adjacent to each other, so it would be a triangle, but in hex grid, it's not possible; each cell has only six neighbors, and no three cells are mutually adjacent.

Perhaps the sixth neighbor is at ( -1,1) or something, but it's 14, which is far.

Let's look at the number 5 at ( -1,0). 5 is adjacent to 1, and also to 15 at ( -2,0), and to 4 at (0,1)? 4 is at (0,1), which is above 1, so above and to the right of 5.

In hex grid, 5 at ( -1,0) should be adjacent to ( -1,1), ( -2,1), ( -2,0), ( -1,-1), (0,0), (0,-1) or something.

In our grid, at ( -1,1):14, ( -2,0):15, ( -1,-1):16, (0,0):1, (0,-1):6.

So 5 is adjacent to 15 (left), 1 (right), 14 (above-left), 16 (below-left), and then above-right and below-right should be at (0,1) and (0,-1), but (0,1) is 4, (0,-1) is 6, and 4 and 6 are not at the same position.

For 5 at ( -1,0), it should be adjacent to (0,1):4? But 4 is at (0,1), which is not directly adjacent if there is cell 1 in between.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the rows are not aligned; in hexagonal grid, for row y, the x-coordinates are offset.

Specifically, for even y, x even, for odd y, x odd, or vice versa.

In this case, for row y=0 (row 2), we have cells at x= -2, -1, 0, 1, 2: 15,5,1,2,9 — all integer x.

For row y=1 (row 1), cells at x= -1,0,1,2: 14,4,3,10 — so x= -1,0,1,2, which are the same as y=0, but for hex grid, usually for adjacent rows, the x-coordinates are shifted.

For example, if y=0 has x even, then y=1 has x odd, or something.

Here, both rows have cells at x= -1,0,1,2, so probably not shifted, so it might not be a standard hex grid, or perhaps it is, but the adjacency is different.

Perhaps "hexagonal grid" means that each cell is a hexagon, so each has six neighbors, but the spiral is wound around, and the grid is infinite, but in this case, for cell 1, its neighbors are the cells directly adjacent in the grid.

From the numbers, likely the neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the grid, 2 is right, 5 is left, 4 is above, 6 is below, 3 is above-right, 7 is below-right, and then below-left and above-left are 16 and 14, which are not neighbors, so perhaps for cell 1, the sixth neighbor is missing, or it is 8 or something, but 8 is at (2,-1), which is farther.

Let's check cell 2 at (1,0): neighbors should include 1 at (0,0), 9 at (2,0), 3 at (1,1), 7 at (1,-1), and then left-up and left-down or something.

2 at (1,0): same row left: (0,0):1, right: (2,0):9

Above: at y=1, x=1:3

Below: at y= -1, x=1:7

Then above-left: at y=1, x=0:4

Below-left: at y= -1, x=0:6

So for cell 2, neighbors are: left:1, right:9, above:3, below:7, above-left:4, below-left:6.

Yes, and 4 and 6 are also neighbors of 1, so it makes sense.

For cell 1 at (0,0):

- right: (1,0):2

- left: ( -1,0):5

- above: at y=1, x=0:4

- below: at y= -1, x=0:6

- above-right: at y=1, x=1:3

- below-right: at y= -1, x=1:7

Yes! I missed that. In this grid, for a cell at (x,y), the neighbors are:

- (x+1,y) : right

- (x-1,y) : left

- (x,y+1) : above (directly)

- (x,y-1) : below (directly)

- (x+1,y+1) : above-right

- (x+1,y-1) : below-right

But not (x-1,y+1) or (x-1,y-1), which are above-left and below-left.

For cell 1 at (0,0), above-left would be ( -1,1):14, which is not a neighbor, and below-left ( -1,-1):16, not neighbor.

But in the list above, for cell 1, neighbors are:

- right: (1,0):2

- left: (-1,0):5

- above: (0,1):4

- below: (0,-1):6

- above-right: (1,1):3

- below-right: (1,-1):7

And indeed, these are all small numbers: 2,5,4,6,3,7. Perfect.

And 14 is at (-1,1), which is neighbor of 5, not of 1.

Similarly, 16 at (-1,-1) neighbor of 5.

So the coordinate system is: each cell has coordinates (x,y), with x,y integers, and neighbors are (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1). But (x-1,y+1) and (x-1,y-1) are not neighbors; only the "right-leaning" diagonals.

In standard terms, this is actually a different grid, but it works.

Note that the vectors are: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (1,-1).

So the sum of the vector components: all have |dx| + |dy| =1 or 2, but specifically, dx and dy such that dx >=0 in the diagonal moves? dx is always non-negative in the diagonal moves? Here dx can be -1 in left move.

The moves are: east, west, north, south, northeast, southeast. But not northwest or southwest.

In this grid, it's not a regular hexagonal grid; it's more like a square grid with additional diagonals, but in this case, each cell has exactly six neighbors as defined, and it forms a hexagonal lattice.

The connectivity is such that it's a hexagonal lattice but oriented with flat sides horizontal, but in this coordinate system, it works.

Now, the spiral is filled in some order.

We need to find the position of 2026, then its six neighbors, then sum them.

First, understand the spiral order.

Start at (0,0) with 1.

Then, where does it go next? To 2, which is at (1,0), east.

Then to 3? 3 is at (1,1), which is northeast.

In the grid, after 2, it might go to 3 or to 9 or to 7.

The sequence: after 1 is 2, then probably 3, then 4? But 4 is at (0,1), which is north of 1.

From the numbers, small numbers are near center.

After 1,2, then next should be 3 at (1,1), then 4 at (0,1), then 5 at (-1,0), then 6 at (0,-1), then 7 at (1,-1), then 8 at (2,-1)? In bottom row, 8 is at (2,-1), but 8 is after 7.

List the order.

Assume it starts at (0,0):1

Moves east to (1,0):2

Then, from 2, it can move north to (1,1):3

Then from 3, it can move west-north? But west is (0,1), but (0,1) is 4, which is not yet placed.

After 3 at (1,1), it might move west to (0,1):4

Then from 4, it can move west to (-1,1)? But (-1,1) is 14, which is larger, so probably not; it should move south or something.

After 4 at (0,1), it might move south to (0,0), but already filled, or south-west to (-1,0):5

Yes, likely to 5 at (-1,0)

Then from 5, it can move south to (0,-1)? But (0,-1) is 6, or south-east to (0,-1)? Vectors: from ( -1,0), moving south is ( -1,-1)? But we don't have that neighbor type; neighbors are only the six defined.

From (x,y), can move to (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1)

So from (-1,0), neighbors: (0,0):1 (filled), (-2,0):15 (not filled), (-1,1):14 (not filled), (-1,-1):16 (not filled), (0,1):4 (filled), (0,-1):6? Is (0,-1) a neighbor? According to the list, neighbors are (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1). For (x,y)=(-1,0), (x+1,y+1)=(0,1):4, (x+1,y-1)=(0,-1):6? (x+1,y-1) = (0,-1), yes, which is below-right.

And (x,y-1)=(-1,-1):16

So neighbors: left: (-2,0), right: (0,0) filled, up: (-1,1), down: (-1,-1), up-right: (0,1) filled, down-right: (0,-1)

So available: (-2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (0,-1)

Now, it placed 5, next should be 6 at (0,-1)? But 6 is small, so likely.

So to (0,-1):6

Then from 6, neighbors: (1,-1):7, (0,0):1 filled, (0,-2)?, (-1,-1):16, (1,0):2 filled, (1,-2)? 

Neighbors of (0,-1): left: (-1,-1), right: (1,-1), up: (0,0) filled, down: (0,-2), up-right: (1,0) filled, down-right: (1,-2)

Available: (-1,-1), (1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

Likely moves to (1,-1):7

Then to (2,-1)? But in grid, at (2,-1) is 8? But after 7 should be 8.

In bottom row, after 7 is 8 at (2,-1), but (2,-1) is neighbor of (1,-1)? Yes, since (1,-1) to (2,-1) is right move.

So (1,-1):7, then (2,-1):8

Then from 8, neighbors: (3,-1), (1,-1) filled, (2,0), (2,-2), (3,0), (3,-2)? 

(2,0) is 9? In row y=0, x=2:9

So probably to (2,0):9

Then from 9, neighbors: (3,0), (1,0):2 filled, (2,1), (2,-1):8 filled, (3,1), (3,-1)

Available: (3,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,-1)

(2,1) is at y=1,x=2:10? In top row, at x=2,y=1:10

So likely to (2,1):10? But 10 is larger, and we have smaller numbers like 11,12 etc.

After 9, it might go to other directions.

The spiral probably goes around.

After center, it fills the first ring: cells at distance 1.

What are the cells at distance 1 from center? In this grid, distance might be defined by steps.

The cells adjacent to center: as we have: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1) — that's six cells: positions: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1)

With numbers: 2,4,5,6,3,7

In the spiral, it placed 1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7 — exactly in that order? 1, then 2 at (1,0), then 3 at (1,1), then 4 at (0,1), then 5 at (-1,0), then 6 at (0,-1), then 7 at (1,-1). Yes, as we assumed.

Then next is 8 at (2,-1), then 9 at (2,0), then probably 10 at (2,1), but in grid (2,1) is 10, yes.

Then from 10, it might go to (1,2) or something, but we don't have that yet.

After 10, next could be 11,12,etc.

The next cell after 7 is 8 at (2,-1), then 9 at (2,0), then 10 at (2,1), then from 10, neighbors include (3,1), (2,2), (1,1):3 filled, (1,2)? 

(1,2) is not yet defined; probably a new cell.

Likely it moves to (1,2) or (3,1).

In the top row, we have at x=1,y=1:3, x=0,y=1:4, x=-1,y=1:14, so probably (1,2) is above (1,1).

Assume it goes to (1,2):11? Then (0,2):12, (-1,2):13, (-1,1):14, etc.

In the grid snippet, at y=1,x=-1:14, so likely (-1,1):14, which is neighbor of (-1,0):5 and (0,1):4.

After 10 at (2,1), it might move west to (1,1), but filled, or north to (2,2), or west-north to (1,2).

Probably to (1,2):11

Then to (0,2):12

Then to (-1,2):13

Then to (-1,1):14 (since left from (-1,2))

Then from 14, neighbors: (-2,1), (-1,0):5 filled, (-1,2):13 filled, (-2,0):15? (0,1):4 filled, etc.

So to (-2,1)? Or (-2,0)

Likely to (-2,0):15, since in row y=0,x=-2:15

Then from 15, to (-2,-1):16? Since in bottom row, (-1,-1):16, so (-2,-1) might be 16? But in grid, at y=-1,x=-1:16, but (-2,-1) would be different.

In our earlier, at y=-1,x=-1:16, which is (-1,-1)

So positions: after 14 at (-1,1), it moves left to (-2,1)? But not defined, or down to (-1,0) filled, or down-right to (0,-1) filled? Down-right is (x+1,y-1)= (0,0) filled.

From (-1,1), neighbors: left: (-2,1), right: (0,1) filled, up: (-1,2) if placed, but we have (-1,2):13, down: (-1,0) filled, up-right: (0,2) if placed, down-right: (0,0) filled.

After placing 14, available neighbors: (-2,1), (-1,2)? But (-1,2) is already placed? We placed (-1,2):13 before 14? Order: we have 10 at (2,1),11 at (1,2),12 at (0,2),13 at (-1,2),14 at (-1,1)

Now from 14 at (-1,1), neighbors: left: (-2,1), right: (0,1) filled, up: (-1,2):13 filled, down: (-1,0):5 filled, up-right: (0,2):12 filled, down-right: (0,0):1 filled.

So only available is left: (-2,1)

So place 15? But in grid, (-2,0) is 15, not (-2,1).

Inconsistency.

After 13 at (-1,2), it might not go to 14 yet.

After placing the first ring (numbers 2-7), then it starts the next layer.

The next cells are those at distance 2.

Cells like (2,0),(2,1),(1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-1,-1),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-1),(2,-2), etc., but some are already filled? No, only the first ring.

The cells adjacent to the first ring.

Typically, the spiral moves outward.

From 7 at (1,-1), it moved to (2,-1):8, then (2,0):9, then (2,1):10, then it needs to go left or up.

From 10 at (2,1), it can move to (1,2):11, then (0,2):12, then (-1,2):13, then from 13, it can move to (-1,1):14, then from 14, to (-2,1): let's call it 15, but in our grid, (-2,0) is 15, not (-2,1).

Perhaps after (-1,2):13, it moves down to (-1,1):14, then from 14, it moves left to (-2,1)? But then what about (-2,0)?

Perhaps it moves to (-2,0) from somewhere else.

After 10, it went to (1,2):11, (0,2):12, (-1,2):13, then instead of down, it moves left to (-2,2)? But not defined.

Perhaps after 9 at (2,0), it could have gone up to (2,1):10, then to (3,1) or something.

To resolve, let's list the numbers in order from the grid.

From the snippet and logic, the sequence might be: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...

With positions:

1: (0,0)

2: (1,0)

3: (1,1)

4: (0,1)

5: (-1,0)

6: (0,-1)

7: (1,-1)

8: (2,-1)  // in grid at y=-1,x=2:8? In our earlier, at y=-1,x=2:8, yes.

9: (2,0)  // y=0,x=2:9

10: (2,1)  // y=1,x=2:10

Now next, likely (1,2):11

(0,2):12

(-1,2):13

Then from here, it can go to (-1,1):14, but (-1,1) is at y=1,x=-1:14, yes.

Then from 14, to (-2,1)? But in grid, (-2,1) is not given, but at y=1,x=-1:14, so next might be (-2,1):15? But in grid, 15 is at y=0,x=-2:15, which is (-2,0)

So perhaps after 14, it moves down to (-2,0):15? But from (-1,1) to (-2,0): is it a neighbor? Vectors: from (x,y)=(-1,1) to (-2,0): dx= -1, dy= -1, but in our neighbor list, we have moves to (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1). So (x-1,y-1) is not a direct neighbor; it's not in the list.

Distance: from (-1,1) to (-2,0), |dx| + |dy| =1+1=2, while neighbors have |dx| + |dy| =1 or 2, but specifically, the allowed moves are only when the move is one of the six types.

The vector from (-1,1) to (-2,0) is (-1,-1), which is not among the neighbor vectors: (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1). So no, not adjacent.

So it cannot move directly from (-1,1) to (-2,0).

From (-1,2):13, after placing, neighbors include (-2,2), (-1,1), (0,2) filled, etc.

So likely it moves to (-1,1):14 from (-1,2)? From (x,y)=(-1,2) to (-1,1): dy= -1, so down move, which is allowed, to (x,y-1)=(-1,1):14

Then from 14 at (-1,1), neighbors: left: (-2,1), right: (0,1) filled, up: (-1,2) filled, down: (-1,0) filled, up-right: (0,2) filled, down-right: (0,0) filled.

So only left: (-2,1)

So place 15 at (-2,1)

But in the grid, we have 15 at (-2,0), which is different.

Contradiction with the given grid.

In the given grid, at y=0 (row 2), x= -2:15, so (-2,0):15

At y=1 (row 1), x= -1:14, so (-1,1):14

So 15 is at (-2,0), not at (-2,1).

So how is 15 placed? It must be placed after some cell.

Perhaps after 5 at (-1,0), or from 14, but not adjacent.

Another possibility: after placing the first few, it goes down first.

After 7 at (1,-1), it placed 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,1), then instead of left to (1,2), it goes down to (2,-2) or something.

But in grid, below (2,-1) is not given, but likely (2,-2) is later.

Perhaps after 10, it moves to (3,1) or (1,2).

Let's assume that after 10 at (2,1), it moves to (1,2):11, then (0,2):12, then (-1,2):13, then it needs to go left or down.

From (-1,2):13, it can move down to (-1,1):14, then from 14, it can move left to (-2,1): let's say 15, but then how to get to (-2,0)? From 15 at (-2,1), it can move down to (-2,0):16, but in grid 16 is at (-1,-1), not (-2,0).

This is messy.

Perhaps the spiral moves in a different order.

Let's list the cells in order of filling.

From the grid and the numbers, the sequence might be: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, then next is 8 at (2,-1), then 9 at (2,0), then 10 at (2,1), then 11 at (1,2), then 12 at (0,2), then 13 at (-1,2), then 14 at (-1,1), but then 15 at (-2,0), which is not adjacent to 14.

Unless it is adjacent, but according to our neighbor definition, from (-1,1) to (-2,0): vector (-1,-1), not in the list.

Perhaps the neighbor set includes (x-1,y-1) for some cells, but earlier for cell 1, it was not needed.

For cell 5 at (-1,0), its neighbors include (-2,0):15, (-1,1):14, (-1,-1):16, (0,0):1, and also (0,1):4, (0,-1):6, as we had.

But ( -2,0) is left, which is in the list.

From 14 at (-1,1), to go to (-2,0), it's not direct, but perhaps after 14, it goes to another cell.

Perhaps after 13 at (-1,2), it goes directly to (-2,1) or something.

To save time, I recall that in such spirals, the grid is filled in rings or layers.

Define the "ring" or "layer" k, with k=0: just 1 cell, number 1.

Layer k=1: 6 cells, numbers 2 to 7.

Layer k=2: 12 cells, numbers 8 to 19? Let's calculate.

In general, for a hexagonal spiral, the number of cells in layer k is 6k for k>=1, and for k=0, 1 cell.

Layer k has cells at distance k from center.

In this grid, what is the distance? For example, cell (2,0): what is its distance from (0,0).

The shortest path: from (0,0) to (2,0): can go right twice: (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0), distance 2.

Cell (1,1): (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1) or (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1), distance 2.

Cell (0,2): (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2), distance 2.

Cell (-1,1): (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,1) or (0,0)->(0,1)->(-1,1)? Is (0,1) adjacent to (-1,1)? From (0,1) to (-1,1): left move, yes, since (x±1,y) is allowed, so (0,1) to (-1,1) is adjacent, so distance from (0,0) to (-1,1) is 2: (0,0)->(0,1)->(-1,1) or (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,1).

Cell (2,1): (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1) distance 3, or (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1) distance 3.

In layer k, cells at graph distance k from center.

Layer 0: distance 0: 1 cell

Layer 1: distance 1: 6 cells: as above, (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1) with numbers 2,4,5,6,3,7

Layer 2: distance 2: cells that are distance 2 from center, not in previous layers.

For example, (2,0): distance 2, as above.

(2,1): distance 3? From (0,0) to (2,1): paths: (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1) distance 3, or (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1) distance 3, or (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)->(2,1) distance 3, so distance 3.

Cell (1,2): (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2) or (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)->(1,2) distance 3.

Cell (0,2): (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2) distance 2.

Cell (0,2): neighbors of (0,1): which is at distance 1, so if (0,1) is adjacent to (0,2), then distance from (0,0) to (0,2) is 2, since (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2).

Yes, because (0,1) to (0,2) is up move, allowed.

Similarly, cell (-1,2): (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(-1,2)? (0,2) to (-1,2): left move, allowed, so (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(-1,2) distance 3, or (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,1)->(-1,2) distance 3.

Cell (-2,0): (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-2,0) distance 2.

Cell (-1,-1): (0,0)->(0,-1)->(-1,-1) or (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,-1) distance 2.

Cell (1,-2): etc.

So for distance 2, cells like (2,0), (0,2), (-2,0), (0,-2), (2,1)? No, (2,1) is distance 3.

List all cells at distance exactly 2.

From center (0,0), cells at dist 2 are those with min path length 2.

For example:

- (2,0): path (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)

- (-2,0): (0,0)-(-1,0)-(-2,0)

- (0,2): (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)

- (0,-2): (0,0)-(0,-1)-(0,-2)

- (2,1)? Dist 3 as above

- (1,1): dist 1, already in layer 1

- (1,2): dist 3

- (-1,2): dist 3

- (2,-1): (0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)-(2,-1)? Dist 3, or (0,0)-(1,-1)-(2,-1) since (1,-1) is dist 1, (1,-1) to (2,-1) is right move, so dist 2? (0,0) to (1,-1) is dist 1, (1,-1) to (2,-1) is dist 1, so total dist 2. Oh! I missed that.

Cell (2,-1): neighbors include (1,-1), which is dist 1, and (1,-1) is adjacent to (0,0)? (0,0) to (1,-1): is it adjacent? Vectors: from (0,0) to (1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1, which is the down-right move, and in our list, it is a neighbor, yes, since (x+1,y-1) is allowed. So (0,0) and (1,-1) are adjacent, distance 1. Then (1,-1) to (2,-1) is right move, distance 1, so (2,-1) is distance 2 from center.

Similarly, cell (2,1): (0,0) to (1,1) dist 1, (1,1) to (2,1) right move, dist 1, so dist 2.

Cell (1,2): (0,0) to (0,1) dist 1, (0,1) to (1,2)? Is (0,1) adjacent to (1,2)? From (0,1) to (1,2): dx=1, dy=1, which is (x+1,y+1), up-right move, which is allowed, yes. So dist 2: (0,0)-(0,1)-(1,2)

Cell (-1,2): (0,0)-(0,1)-(-1,2)? (0,1) to (-1,2): dx= -1, dy=1, which is (x-1,y+1), left-up, but in our neighbor list, we have only (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1). So (x-1,y+1) is not included; it's not a neighbor. So not directly adjacent.

Path: (0,0)-(-1,0)-(-1,1)-(-1,2) dist 3, or (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(-1,2) dist 3, so dist 3.

Similarly, cell (-2,1): dist to (0,0): paths, min dist 3, e.g. (0,0)-(-1,0)-(-2,0)-(-2,1) or (0,0)-(-1,0)-(-1,1)-(-2,1) etc.

So for distance 2, the cells are those that can be reached in 2 moves.

Each move is to one of the six neighbors.

So from (0,0), after two moves, the possible positions.

The net displacement (dx,dy) with each move having vectors: v1=(1,0), v2=(-1,0), v3=(0,1), v4=(0,-1), v5=(1,1), v6=(1,-1)

So after two moves, sum of two vectors.

Possible sums:

v1+v1=(2,0)

v1+v2=(0,0) back, but dist 2 means not back, but can be, but for distinct cells, but for distance, it's the graph distance, not Euclidean.

In graph distance, cells at dist 2 are those not at dist 0 or 1, and adjacent to a dist 1 cell.

So cells adjacent to layer 1 cells but not in layer 0 or 1.

Layer 1 cells: A: (1,0), B: (0,1), C: (-1,0), D: (0,-1), E: (1,1), F: (1,-1)

Now for each, its neighbors, minus those already in layer 0 or 1.

For A (1,0): neighbors: (2,0), (0,0) center, (1,1) E, (1,-1) F, (2,1), (2,-1)

(0,0) is layer 0, (1,1) and (1,-1) are layer 1, so new: (2,0), (2,1), (2,-1)

For B (0,1): neighbors: (1,1) E, (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0) center, (1,2), (-1,2)? But (-1,2) may not be neighbor if (x-1,y+1) not allowed.

Neighbors: (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0), (1,2), and ( -1,2)? List:

( x±1,y) : (1,1), (-1,1)

( x,y±1) : (0,2), (0,0)

( x+1,y+1) : (1,2)

( x+1,y-1) : (1,0) A

So neighbors: (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0), (1,2), (1,0)

(0,0) layer 0, (1,0) A layer 1, (1,1) E layer 1, so new: (-1,1), (0,2), (1,2)

Similarly for C (-1,0): neighbors: (0,0), (-2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (0,1) B, (0,-1) D

New: (-2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1)  (since (0,0),(0,1),(0,-1) already)

For D (0,-1): neighbors: (1,-1) F, (-1,-1), (0,-2), (0,0), (1,-2), (-1,0) C

New: (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

For E (1,1): neighbors: (2,1), (1,2), (1,0) A, (1,2)? (x,y)=(1,1)

( x±1,y): (2,1), (0,1) B

( x,y±1): (1,2), (1,0) A

( x+1,y+1): (2,2)

( x+1,y-1): (2,0)

So neighbors: (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), (1,0), (2,2), (2,0)

Already in layers: (0,1) B, (1,0) A, so new: (2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,0)

But (2,0) is also listed from A.

For F (1,-1): neighbors: (2,-1), (1,0) A, (1,-2), (0,-1) D, (2,0), (2,-2)

New: (2,-1), (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,0) again.

Now, list all new cells for layer 2: from above:

From A: (2,0), (2,1), (2,-1)

From B: (-1,1), (0,2), (1,2)

From C: (-2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1)  but (-1,1) also from B

From D: (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

From E: (2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,0) duplicates

From F: (2,-1), (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,0) duplicates

So unique cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,-1), (-1,1), (0,2), (1,2), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), and from E and F: (2,2), (2,-2)

But (2,2) and (2,-2) are new.

Also, is (-1,1) listed, etc.

So total: let's list:

- (2,0)

- (2,1)

- (2,-1)

- (-1,1)

- (0,2)

- (1,2)

- (-2,0)

- (-1,-1)

- (0,-2)

- (1,-2)

- (2,2)

- (2,-2)

That's 12 cells, which matches the general formula for hexagonal layer k, number of cells is 6k for k>=1, so for k=2, 12 cells.

Now in the grid, what are the numbers at these positions.

From the snippet:

(2,0): in y=0,x=2:9

(2,1): y=1,x=2:10

(2,-1): y=-1,x=2:8

(-1,1): y=1,x=-1:14

(0,2): not given, but likely 12 or something

(1,2): not given

(-2,0): y=0,x=-2:15

(-1,-1): y=-1,x=-1:16

(0,-2): not given

(1,-2): not given

(2,2): not given

(2,-2): not given

In the spiral order, after 7 at (1,-1), it placed 8 at (2,-1), which is in layer 2.

Then 9 at (2,0), layer 2.

Then 10 at (2,1), layer 2.

Then likely 11 at (2,2)? But (2,2) is in layer 2, since dist 2.

Or 11 at (1,2)

Assume it continues in the same direction.

After placing 10 at (2,1), it might move to (2,2):11, then to (1,2):12, then to (0,2):13, then to (-1,2)? But (-1,2) is dist 3, not in layer 2.

From (0,2), it can move to (-1,2)? But not adjacent, as before.

From (0,2), it can move to (0,1), but filled, or to (-1,1), but not directly.

After (2,1):10, move to (1,2):11 (up-left or something), then to (0,2):12, then to (-1,1)? But not adjacent.

Perhaps after (2,1):10, it moves down or left.

Another common way is to turn left or right.

Perhaps after reaching (2,1), it moves west to (1,1), but filled, or north to (2,2), or south to (2,0) filled.

So likely to (2,2):11

Then from (2,2), to (1,2):12

Then from (1,2), to (0,2):13

Then from (0,2), to (0,1), filled, or to (-1,2)? not adjacent, or to (1,1) filled, or to (0,3), but dist larger.

So perhaps to (-1,1)? But not adjacent.

From (0,2), it can move to (0,3) or to (-1,2), but not if not neighbor.

Perhaps the spiral at this point moves to a different cell.

Let's look at the number 11. In the grid not given, but likely it is at (1,2) or (2,2).

Assume that after 10 at (2,1), it moves to (1,2):11, then to (0,2):12, then to (-1,2):13, but (-1,2) is dist 3, as earlier, so not in layer 2.

For cell (-1,2): earlier we said dist 3, but let's calculate.

From (0,0) to (-1,2): paths.

One path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (-1,2)? (0,2) to (-1,2): dx= -1, dy=0, so left move, which is allowed, since (x±1,y) is neighbor. So (0,2) to (-1,2) is adjacent, and (0,0) to (0,1) dist 1, (0,1) to (0,2) dist 2, (0,2) to (-1,2) dist 3, so yes dist 3.

But for layer 2, only dist 2 cells.

So (-1,2) is not in layer 2; it's in layer 3.

Similarly, in layer 2, we have cells like (0,2), which is dist 2, as (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2) dist 2.

(0,2) is in layer 2.

From (0,2), it can move to (1,2), which is dist 2, as (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,2) dist 2, or (0,0)->(1,1)->(1,2) dist 2.

(1,2) is in layer 2.

Then from (1,2), to (2,2), dist 2, as (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,2) dist 2? (1,1) to (2,2): dx=1, dy=1, (x+1,y+1) move, allowed, and (0,0) to (1,1) dist 1, so yes dist 2.

So (2,2) in layer 2.

Similarly, (2,-2), etc.

So the layer 2 cells are: as listed: (2,0), (2,1), (2,-1), (-1,1), (0,2), (1,2), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,2), (2,-2), and also (-2,1)? No, (-2,1) dist 3.

From earlier list, we have 12 cells: let's list them with their "types".

The cells at dist 2 are those with |x| + |y| =2 or other, but not, because (2,0) |x|+|y|=2, (0,2) |x|+|y|=2, (2,1) |x|+|y|=3, but it is in layer 2.

In this grid, the distance is not Manhattan; it's graph distance.

From the list: the 12 cells are:

- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (-1,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,-1)

From earlier collection, we have these 12.

Now in the spiral order, after the first 7 numbers (layer 0 and 1), then layer 2 has 12 cells, numbers 8 to 19.

In the grid, we have 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,1), so likely it is filling the "right" side first.

Then next could be (2,2):11, then (1,2):12, then (0,2):13, then it needs to go left to (-1,1), but (-1,1) is in layer 2, and is adjacent to (0,2)? From (0,2) to (-1,1): dx= -1, dy= -1, vector (-1,-1), not in neighbor vectors, so not adjacent.

From (0,2) to (-1,2)? But (-1,2) not in layer 2; it's dist 3.

So perhaps after (0,2):13, it moves down to (0,1), filled, or to (1,2) filled, or to (0,3), dist 3.

So likely it moves to a different cell, like (-2,0) or something.

Perhaps the spiral goes to (2,2):11, then (1,2):12, then (0,2):13, then to ( -1,1):14, but is (0,2) adjacent to (-1,1)? As above, not directly.

Unless we allow the move, but according to our earlier, not.

Perhaps from (1,2):12, it moves to (1,1), filled, or to (0,2):13, or to (2,2):11 already, or to (1,3), dist 3.

So after (0,2):13, it might move to (-1,1) by a different path, but in spiral, it should be adjacent.

Perhaps the order is different. After 10 at (2,1), it moves to (2,2):11, then to (1,2):12, then instead of (0,2), it moves to (1,1) filled, or to (0,1) filled, so must go to (0,2):13.

Then from 13, it can move to ( -1,1) if we consider it adjacent, but geometrically, in the grid, cell (0,2) and (-1,1) may share a corner but not a side, so not adjacent.

Perhaps in this grid, the neighbor set is different for some cells, but that would be inconsistent.

Another idea: perhaps the coordinate system is not with integer x,y; perhaps it's offset.

For example, in some hex grids, for even y, x even, for odd y, x odd.

But in our case, for y=0, we have x= -2,-1,0,1,2 all present, so probably not.

Perhaps for the spiral, after placing (2,1):10, it moves south to (2,0), but filled, or west to (1,1), filled, so only north to (2,2):11.

Then from (2,2), neighbors: (3,2), (2,1) filled, (2,3), (1,2), (3,3), (3,1)

So can move to (1,2):12

Then from (1,2), to (0,2):13

Then from (0,2), to (-1,2)? But not in layer 2, and not adjacent.

To (0,1) filled, or to (1,1) filled, or to (0,3)

So perhaps to (0,3):14, but dist 3.

Then it would be in layer 3.

But in the grid, we have 14 at (-1,1), which is in layer 2, as dist 2: (0,0)->(0,1)->(-1,1) or (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,1) dist 2.

So it must be placed in layer 2.

So how to reach it from the current path.

Perhaps after placing some cells, it jumps.

Perhaps the spiral after the first few in layer 2, it goes to the left side.

For example, after 7, it placed 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,1), then instead of up, it goes left to (1,2), but (1,2) is not adjacent to (2,1)? From (2,1) to (1,2): dx= -1, dy=1, vector (-1,1), not in neighbor vectors, so not adjacent.

From (2,1) to (1,1): dx= -1, dy=0, left move, allowed, but (1,1) is filled with 3.

So no.

Perhaps from 10 at (2,1), it moves down to (2,0), filled, or to (3,1), which is dist 3, or to (2,2).

So must be (2,2):11.

Then same problem.

Unless at (0,2) it can go to (-1,1) by a move that is allowed, but according to the neighbor definition, not.

Perhaps for cell (0,2), the neighbor includes (x-1,y-1) or something, but for cell 1 at (0,0), it was not needed.

Let's check if (0,2) and (-1,1) are adjacent.

From earlier, for cell 4 at (0,1), its neighbors include ( -1,1):14, and (0,2): ? not yet, but (0,1) to (0,2) is up, allowed, (0,1) to (-1,1) is left, allowed.

But (0,2) to (-1,1): if they are not adjacent, then from (0,2) to (-1,1) is not direct.

In the grid, cell at (0,2) and (-1,1) may not share a side; there might be cell at (0,1) or (-1,2) in between.

So likely not adjacent.

To resolve, let's assume that the spiral order for layer 2 is: start from (2,-1):8, then (2,0):9, then (2,1):10, then (2,2):11, then (1,2):12, then (0,2):13, then from here, since can't go left, it goes down to (0,1), filled, or to ( -1,2), but dist 3, or perhaps to (0,3), dist 3, or it turns to ( -1,1), but not adjacent.

Perhaps after (0,2):13, it moves to ( -1,2):14, even though dist 3, but in the grid, (-1,2) might be 14, but in given, (-1,1) is 14, not (-1,2).

In given, at y=1,x= -1:14, so ( -1,1):14, not ( -1,2).

So ( -1,2) is not given, likely later.

Perhaps the cell at ( -1,1) is reached from ( -1,0):5, but 5 is already placed, and from 5, it can move to ( -1,1):14, but in the spiral, it is placed after 13.

In the sequence, after 7,8,9,10, then 11,12,13, then 14 at (-1,1), but how to get there from 13 at (0,2).

Unless 13 is at a different cell.

Perhaps (0,2) is not 13; perhaps 13 is at another place.

Let's calculate the number for each cell in layer 2.

The first cell in layer 2 is 8 at (2,-1)

Then 9 at (2,0)

10 at (2,1)

Then if it goes to (2,2):11

(1,2):12

(0,2):13

Then next could be (-1,1):14, and even though not adjacent, in the spiral path, it might be placed next, but typically it should be adjacent to the previous cell or to the current boundary.

In many spirals, the next cell is adjacent to the last placed cell and to the unfilled area.

From (0,2):13, the cell (-1,1) is not adjacent, but perhaps it is adjacent to the aggregate.

Perhaps from (0,2), it moves to (0,1), filled, then to (-1,1):14, but that would be backtracking, and 14 would be placed after moving to (0,1), but (0,1) is already filled with 4.

So not.

Perhaps the order is: after 10 at (2,1), it moves to (1,2):11, then to (0,2):12, then to (-1,1):13, but is (0,2) adjacent to (-1,1)? No.

Unless we define the neighbor to include (x-1,y-1) for some, but that would make it inconsistent.

Perhaps for cells with y even or odd, the neighbor set is different, but that would be complicated.

Another idea: perhaps the " above-right" and "below-right" are only for some orientations, but in this case, for all cells, the neighbor directions are the same.

Let's list the cells that are filled early.

From the grid, after 1 to 7, then 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,1), then next is not given, but likely 11 at (1,2) or (2,2).

Then 12 at (0,2), then 13 at (-1,1)? But how.

Perhaps 11 at (3,1) or something, but dist larger.

Perhaps after 10, it goes to (1,1), filled, so to (0,1), filled, so to ( -1,1):11, but ( -1,1) is not adjacent to (2,1).

So not.

Perhaps the spiral goes counter-clockwise, so after (2,1):10, instead of up, it goes down-left or something.

From (2,1), it can move to (2,0) filled, or to (1,1) filled, or to (3,1), dist 3, or to (2,2), or to (3,0), etc.

So (2,2):11 or (3,1):11.

If (3,1):11, then (3,0):12, (3,-1):13, etc., but then ( -1,1) is not covered.

Perhaps for layer 2, it fills in order around.

Typically, it fills the cells in angular order.

Perhaps start from the cell in the direction of the initial move.

Initial move from 1 to 2: east to (1,0).

Then to 3: northeast to (1,1).

Then to 4: west-north to (0,1).

Then to 5: west to (-1,0).

Then to 6: south-west to (0,-1).

Then to 7: south-east to (1,-1).

Then for layer 2, it continues in the same direction: from 7 at (1,-1), move southeast to (2,-1):8.

Then from 8, the next move might be east to (3,-1), but in our case it went to (2,0):9, which is north-east.

From (2,-1), neighbors include (3,-1), (2,0), (2,-2), etc.

It moved to (2,0):9, which is up.

Then to (2,1):10, up again.

Then from (2,1), it can go up to (2,2):11, or left to (1,1), filled, or right to (3,1), etc.

If it goes to (2,2):11, then from there, to (1,2):12, then to (0,2):13, then it is stuck, so perhaps it turns down or left.

From (0,2):13, it can go to (0,1), filled, or to (-1,2), but not adjacent, or to (0,3), so perhaps to (0,3):14, but dist 3.

Then later to (-1,1):15 or something.

But in grid, 14 is at (-1,1), so not.

Perhaps after (0,2):13, it moves to (-1,0) or something, but not adjacent.

I think the only way is to realize that from (0,2) to (-1,1) is not adjacent, so it must go to a different cell.

Perhaps after (1,2):12, it moves to (0,2):13, then to ( -1,2):14, even though dist 3, and in the grid, if (-1,2) is 14, but in given, it is at (-1,1), so not.

Unless the grid has (-1,2) as 14, but in the snippet, "14 4 3 10" and 4 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1), so 14 at x= -1,y=1, so (-1,1).

So must be at (-1,1).

So perhaps the cell at ( -1,1) is reached from ( -1,0):5, but in the spiral, 5 is already placed, and from 5, it can be placed after, but in order, after 7, it is placing layer 2, not layer 1.

Layer 1 is already filled.

So for layer 2, ( -1,1) is a cell, and it must be placed when the spiral reaches it.

So likely, after placing the right side, it moves to the top or left.

From (0,2):13, it might move to ( -2,0) or something, but not adjacent.

Perhaps the next cell is (1, -2) or (0,-2), but that is on the bottom.

Let's calculate the number of the cell.

Perhaps the spiral is filled in rings, and for each ring, it starts at a particular point and goes around.

For layer k, it starts at the cell in the "east" direction or something.

For layer 1, it started at (1,0):2, then went to (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7.

So for layer 2, it might start at (2,0):8? But in our case, it started at (2,-1):8, which is southeast of (2,0).

Perhaps it starts at the cell in the same direction as the last cell of previous layer.

Last cell of layer 1 is (1,-1):7, which is southeast, so for layer 2, start at (2,-1):8, which is further southeast.

Then from there, it might go northeast to (2,0):9, then to (2,1):10, then to (2,2):11, then turn to west-north to (1,2):12, then to (0,2):13, then to (-1,2): but not in layer 2, or to (-1,1):14, but not adjacent.

From (0,2):13, it can go south to (0,1), filled, so perhaps it turns to southwest to (-1,1):14, even if not adjacent in grid, but in the spiral path, it is placed next.

In some spirals, the next cell may not be adjacent to the last cell, but to the set, but usually it is adjacent.

Perhaps from (0,2):13, it moves to ( -1,2):14, and we assume it is in layer 2, but earlier we said dist 3, but perhaps for this grid, dist is different.

Let's calculate dist from (0,0) to (-1,2).

Paths: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (-1,2) : dist 3, as each step 1.

(0,0) -> (-1,0) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,2) : dist 3.

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,2) : dist 3.

No shorter path, so dist 3.

Whereas (0,2) is dist 2.

So (-1,2) is layer 3.

So not.

Perhaps ( -1,1) is layer 2, and it is adjacent to (0,1):4, which is layer 1, and to ( -1,0):5, layer 1, and to ( -2,1), etc.

In the spiral, after placing the cells on the right, it may jump to the left side, but usually it is continuous.

Perhaps after 10 at (2,1), it moves to (1,1), filled, so it must go to (3,1):11, then (3,0):12, (3,-1):13, (2,-2):14, etc., but then the left side is not filled, and 14 is at (-1,1), not covered.

So for 2026, I need to find which layer it is in, then its position, then neighbors.

First, find the layer of n.

Let S(k) be the number of cells in layers 0 to k.

Layer 0: 1 cell

Layer 1: 6 cells

Layer 2: 12 cells

Layer 3: 18 cells? In general for hexagonal, layer k has 6k cells for k>=1.

So S(k) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6* k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: S(0) = 1 + 3*0*1 = 1, good.

k=1: 1 + 3*1*2 = 1+6=7, good (1 to 7)

k=2: 1 + 3*2*3 = 1+18=19, so numbers 1 to 19 in layers 0,1,2.

In our grid, layer 2 cells are 8 to 19.

Now for n=2026, find k such that S(k-1) < 2026 <= S(k)

S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Solve 1 + 3k(k+1) >= 2026

3k^2 + 3k +1 >= 2026

3k^2 + 3k -2025 >=0

k^2 + k -675 >=0

k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.96

So k >= [ -1 + 51.96]/2 = 50.96/2 = 25.48

So k=26

S(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1+1950=1951

S(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1+2106=2107

1951 < 2026 <= 2107, so 2026 is in layer 26.

Number of cells before layer 26 is S(25) = 1951

So in layer 26, the first cell is number 1952, and there are 6*26 = 156 cells in the layer, so numbers 1952 to 1951+156=2107.

2026 - 1951 = 75, so it is the 75th cell in layer 26.

Now, in each layer k, the cells are arranged in a hexagon, and the layer starts at a particular point.

Typically, for hexagonal spiral, layer k starts at the cell (k,0) or something.

In our coordinate, for layer 1, cells from (1,0) to (1,-1)

For layer 2, from (2,-1) to (2,-2) or something.

Generally, the layer k has cells with max(|x|,|y|,|x-y|) or something, but in this grid, the distance is not Euclidean.

From earlier, the distance is the graph distance, which for this grid, since each move changes x and y by at most 1, and the distance is the shortest path length.

For a cell (x,y), what is its distance from (0,0).

The moves allow changing x by ±1, y by 0; or x by 0, y by ±1; or x by +1, y by +1; or x by +1, y by -1. So the moves are: (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1)

So the net displacement per move is one of these vectors.

To go from (0,0) to (x,y), we need to find min number of moves.

This is like a grid with allowed steps.

The gcd of the move vectors, but all have dx, dy integers, and the lattice is all integer (x,y), since from (0,0) we can reach any (x,y) with x,y integers, because with (1,0) and (0,1), we can reach all, but here we have only (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1), so with (1,0) and (0,1), we can reach any (x,y), so yes, the grid is all integer coordinates.

The distance d(x,y) is the min number of moves from (0,0) to (x,y).

This can be computed by solving the shortest path.

Notice that the move (1,1) is like diagonal, but in this case, since we have also axis-aligned, it's a bit different.

The distance can be found by considering the values.

From (0,0), after d moves, the position (x,y) must satisfy that the net displacement is sum of d vectors from the set.

The set of vectors: V = { (±1,0), (0,±1), (1,1), (1,-1) }

Note that (1,1) and (1,-1) are included, but not (-1,1) or (-1,-1), so it's not symmetric in all directions.

For example, to go to (-1,1), as before, we can go (0,0) -> (-1,0) -> (-1,1) or (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1), each 2 moves, so dist 2.

To go to (1,1): (0,0) -> (1,1) in 1 move, dist 1.

To go to (2,0): (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) dist 2, or (0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,0)? (1,1) to (2,0): dx=1, dy= -1, which is (1,-1) move, allowed, so (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,0) dist 2.

To go to (2,2): (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,2) dist 2.

To go to (3,0): (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0) dist 3, or (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,0)? (2,1) to (3,0): dx=1, dy= -1, (1,-1) move, allowed, and (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,1) dist 2, then to (3,0) dist 3.

Min dist 3.

In general, the distance d(x,y) can be found.

Notice that each move changes x+y by 0, ±2, or ±1, etc.

Vector (1,0): dx+dy=1

(-1,0): -1

(0,1):1

(0,-1):-1

(1,1):2

(1,-1):0

So the sum s = x+y changes by 1, -1, 1, -1, 2, 0 respectively.

The net s = x+y must be achievable with the moves.

Also, the difference.

Perhaps the distance is max(|x|,|y|,|x-y|) or something, but let's test.

For (2,0): x=2,y=0, max(2,0,2-0)=2, and dist 2, good.

(0,2): max(0,2,0-2)=2, dist 2, good.

(2,1): x=2,y=1, max(2,1,1)=2, dist 2, good.

(1,2): max(1,2,-1)=2, dist 2, good.

( -1,1): x= -1,y=1, max(1,1, -2)=2, dist 2, good.

( -2,0): max(2,0, -2)=2, dist 2, good.

(0,-2): max(0,2,2)=2, dist 2, good.

(2,2): max(2,2,0)=2, dist 2, good.

(3,0): max(3,0,3)=3, dist 3, good.

(1,1): max(1,1,0)=1, dist 1, good.

(0,0):0, good.

(1,0):1, good.

Now for ( -1,2): x= -1,y=2, max(1,2, -3)=2, but dist 3, as earlier, so not.

So not accurate.

For ( -1,2), dist 3, while max(|x|,|y|,|x-y|)=max(1,2,3)=3, and |x| + |y| =3, but for (2,1) |x|+|y|=3, dist 2, so not.

Perhaps d = max(|x|,|y|) for some, but for (2,1) max(2,1)=2, dist 2, good, but for (1,1) max(1,1)=1, good, for (0,2) max(0,2)=2, good, for (-1,2) max(1,2)=2, but dist 3, not good.

So not.

Since the moves include (1,0),(0,1),(1,1), etc., the distance might be floor or something.

We can use the formula based on the values.

Let a = x, b = y.

Then the distance d satisfies d >= |x|, d >= |y|, d >= |x-y|, but not sufficient.

From the move set, we can go to (x,y) by using the moves.

Notice that the move (1,0) and (0,1) allow us to change x and y independently, but with cost, but the diagonal moves allow shortcuts.

In particular, the move (1,1) allows to increase both x and y by 1 in one move, similarly (1,-1) increase x by 1, y by -1.

To minimize the number of moves, we can use the diagonal moves when possible.

For example, to go to (x,y), we can use min(|x|,|y|) diagonal moves in the appropriate direction, then the remaining with axis moves.

But the diagonal moves are only for increasing x, not for decreasing.

For example, to go to (3,3): can use 3 times (1,1), so dist 3.

To (3,0): can use (1,0) three times, dist 3, or (1,1) and (1,-1) but (1,1) to (1,1), then (1,-1) to (2,0), then (1,0) to (3,0), dist 3.

To ( -3,0): use (-1,0) three times, dist 3.

To ( -3,3): use (-1,0) three times and (0,1) three times, dist 6, or better: (-1,0) to (-1,0), then (0,1) to (-1,1), then (-1,0) to (-2,1), etc, still dist 6, or use (1,1) but not helpful for negative.

The diagonal moves only allow to increase x with y or -y, not to decrease x.

To decrease x, only with (-1,0), which does not change y, or with other, but no diagonal for decrease x.

So for cells with x<0, it may take more moves.

For example, to ( -1,1): as before, dist 2: e.g. (-1,0) then (0,1) but from (-1,0) to (-1,1): (0,1) move, so yes.

To ( -2,2): (0,0) -> (-1,0) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,2) -> (-2,2)? (-1,2) to (-2,2): (-1,0) move, so dist 4.

Or (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,2) -> (-2,2) dist 4.

Can we do better? Use (1,1) but not helpful. Min dist 4.

Whereas for (2,2) dist 2.

So the distance depends on the quadrant.

In general, for a cell (x,y), the distance d can be calculated as follows.

Let a = |x|, b = |y|.

Then if x >=0, then we can use (1,1) or (1,-1) for the common part.

Specifically, if x >=0, then we can use min(x, |y|) diagonal moves of type (1, sign(y)) if y!=0, but since (1,1) and (1,-1), so for the direction of y.

For example, if y >=0, then use min(x,y) times (1,1), then the remaining |x-y| with (1,0) or (0,1).

After min(x,y) moves of (1,1), we are at (min(x,y), min(x,y)), then to (x,y), if x>y, we need to move right (x-y) times with (1,0), so total moves min(x,y) + (x-y) = x.

If y>x, we need to move up (y-x) times with (0,1), so total min(x,y) + (y-x) = y.

So if x>=0, y>=0, d = max(x,y)

Similarly, if x>=0, y<0, then use min(x, |y|) = min(x,-y) times (1,-1), then if x > -y, move right (x +y) times with (1,0), total min(x,-y) + (x +y) = x + min(x,-y) - min(x,-y) + x +y, wait.

After min(x,|y|) = min(x,-y) moves of (1,-1), we are at (min(x,-y), - min(x,-y))

Then if x > -y, we are at ( -y, y) since y<0, -y>0, and x > -y, so at ( -y, y), need to move right (x - (-y)) = x + y times with (1,0), so total moves min(x,-y) + (x + y)

Since min(x,-y) + x + y = x + min(x,-y) + y

But y<0, -y>0, so if x <= -y, min(x,-y) = x, so d = x + x + y = 2x + y

If x > -y, min(x,-y) = -y, so d = -y + x + y = x

So in summary, for x>=0, y<0, d = max(x, -y) if x + y >=0, else something, from above: if x <= -y, d = 2x + y, else d = x

But 2x + y when x <= -y, and since y<0, -y>0, x <= -y, and 2x + y = 2x + y, and since x <= -y, 2x + y <= 2(-y) + y = -2y + y = -y, and since y<0, -y>0, but also 2x + y could be negative if y very negative, but in this case x>=0, y<0, and x <= -y, so 2x + y <= 2(-y) + y = -y >0, and since x>=0, 2x+y >= y > -infty, but for example (2,-1): x=2,y= -1, -y=1, x=2>1= -y, so d = x =2, which matches earlier.

If x=1,y= -2, then -y=2, x=1<2, so d = 2x + y = 2*1 + (-2) = 0, impossible.

Mistake.

For (1,-2): x=1,y= -2>=0? y<0.

- y =2, x=1 <2, so min(x,-y)= min(1,2)=1

After 1 move of (1,-1): to (1,-1)

Then at (1,-1), need to go to (1,-2), so move down with (0,-1), to (1,-2), so total 2 moves.

From formula, if x <= -y, d = 2x + y = 2*1 + (-2) =0, not 2, error.

From earlier calculation: after min(x,|y|) = min(1,2)=1 move of (1,-1) to (1,-1), then from there to (1,-2) with (0,-1), so 2 moves.

General formula: after k = min(x,|y|) moves of (1, sign(y)) but for y<0, sign(y)= -1, so (1,-1), to (k, -k)

Then from (k, -k) to (x,y) = (x,-|y|)

Since y<0, |y| = -y.

So from (k, -k) to (x, -|y|)

The remaining dx = x - k, dy = -|y| - (-k) = -|y| + k

Then we need to cover this with axis moves: (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)

Since x>=0, and k = min(x,|y|) <= x, so dx = x - k >=0

 dy = k - |y|

Since k = min(x,|y|) <= |y|, so dy = k - |y| <=0

So dy <=0, dx >=0.

To move from (k, -k) to (x, -|y|), we need to move right (x - k) times, and down ( |y| - k) times, since dy = - (|y| - k), so down |y| - k times.

And since these moves are orthogonal, the number of moves is (x - k) + (|y| - k) = x + |y| - 2k

Then total moves = k + (x + |y| - 2k) = x + |y| - k

But k = min(x,|y|), so d = x + |y| - min(x,|y|) = max(x,|y|)

For x>=0, y<0, d = max(x, |y|)

In the example (1,-2): max(1,2) =2, good.

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, good.

(3,-3): max(3,3)=3, and can go (1,-1) three times, dist 3, good.

Now for x<0, y>=0.

For example ( -1,1): x= -1<0, y=1>0.

Can use (-1,0) and (0,1), dist 2, and max(|x|,|y|) = max(1,1)=1, not 2.

So d =2, while max(|x|,|y|)=1.

So different.

Similarly, for ( -2,2): dist 4, max(2,2)=2, not 4.

So for x<0, it takes more moves.

Specifically, to decrease x, only with (-1,0), which doesn't change y, or with other, but no diagonal for decrease.

So to go to (x,y) with x<0, we must use |x| times (-1,0) to decrease x, and during that, we can also change y with (0,1) or (0,-1), but since the moves are separate, the total number is at least |x| + |y|, but can be less if we interleave, but in this case, since the moves are independent, the min number is |x| + |y|, because each (-1,0) decreases x by 1, each (0,1) increases y by 1, etc., and they don't help each other, so d = |x| + |y| for x<0, y any.

For ( -1,1): |x| + |y| =1+1=2, good.

For ( -2,2): 2+2=4, good.

For ( -1,0): | -1| + |0| =1, and dist 1, good.

For (0,-1): x=0>=0, y= -1<0, so d = max(0,1) =1, good.

For ( -1,-1): x<0, y<0, d = |x| + |y| =1+1=2, and can go (-1,0) to (-1,0), then (0,-1) to (-1,-1), dist 2, good.

Now for x>=0, y>=0, we had d = max(x,y)

For x>=0, y<0, d = max(x, |y|)

For x<0, y>=0, d = |x| + |y|

For x<0, y<0, d = |x| + |y|

So in summary:

If x >= 0, d = max(x, |y|)

If x < 0, d = |x| + |y|

Since |y| is always non-negative, we can write:

d(x,y) = {
  max(x, |y|)  if x >= 0
  |x| + |y|    if x < 0
}

For (x,y) = ( -1,1): x<0, d=1+1=2

(2,1): x>=0, d= max(2,1)=2

(0,2): x=0>=0, d= max(0,2)=2

( -2,0): x<0, d=2+0=2

(2,-1): x>=0, d= max(2,1)=2

( -1,-1): x<0, d=1+1=2

(3,0): x>=0, d=max(3,0)=3

(0,-3): x=0>=0, d=max(0,3)=3

( -3,0): x<0, d=3+0=3

( -3,3): x<0, d=3+3=6

(3,3): x>=0, d=max(3,3)=3

Good.

Now for layer k, all cells with d(x,y) = k.

For k=26, d(x,y)=26.

2026 is in layer 26, and it is the 75th cell in the layer.

Now to find its position (x,y), and then its neighbors.

But to find (x,y), I need to know how the spiral orders the cells in the layer.

Typically, for each layer, it starts at a specific point and goes around counter-clockwise or clockwise.

From the initial layers, for layer 1, it started at (1,0) and went to (1,1), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) — so in order: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast.

For layer 2, it started at (2,-1), which is southeast of center, then to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), then likely (1,2), (0,2), then to (-1,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)

And in the grid, we have (2,-1):8, (2,0):9, (2,1):10, then (2,2):11, (1,2):12, (0,2):13, then (-1,1):14, (-2,0):15, (-1,-1):16, then (0,-2):17, (1,-2):18, (2,-2):19

And this matches the given: 14 at (-1,1), 15 at (-2,0), 16 at (-1,-1), and 8 to 10 as given.

So the order in layer k is: start at (k, -k+1)? For k=2, start at (2,-1) = (k, -k+1)? -2+1= -1, yes.

Then move in the direction of increasing y: to (k, -k+2) = (2,0), then (2,1), (2,2) = (k,k)

Then turn to decreasing x: to (k-1,k) = (1,2), then (k-2,k) = (0,2), then when x=0, it may turn, but in this case to (-1,1), which is not ( -1,2)

From (0,2), it went to (-1,1), but according to the coordinate, (-1,1) has x= -1, y=1.

After (0,2), next is (-1,1), which is not on the same row or column.

In terms of direction, from (0,2), it moved southwest to (-1,1).

Then from (-1,1) to (-2,0), which is west-south or something.

Then to (-1,-1), south-east, etc.

So the path for layer k is: start at (k, -k+1)

Then move north (increase y) to (k, -k+2), (k, -k+3), ..., up to (k,k)

Then move northwest (decrease x, increase y? but in this case, from (k,k) to (k-1,k), which is west (decrease x, y same)

Then continue west to (k-2,k), ..., down to when x= -k or something.

In layer 2, from (2,2) to (1,2) to (0,2), then to (-1,1), not to (-2,2).

After (0,2), it went to (-1,1), which is decrease x and decrease y.

Then to (-2,0), decrease x and decrease y.

Then to (-1,-1), increase x and decrease y? from (-2,0) to (-1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1, so southeast move.

Then to (0,-2), east move? dx=1, dy=0? from (-1,-1) to (0,-2): dx=1, dy= -1, southeast move.

Let's list the sequence for layer 2:

1. (2,-1) :8

2. (2,0) :9

3. (2,1) :10

4. (2,2) :11

5. (1,2) :12

6. (0,2) :13

7. (-1,1) :14  // from (0,2) to (-1,1): dx= -1, dy= -1

8. (-2,0) :15  // from (-1,1) to (-2,0): dx= -1, dy= -1

9. (-1,-1) :16  // from (-2,0) to (-1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1

10. (0,-2) :17  // from (-1,-1) to (0,-2): dx=1, dy= -1

11. (1,-2) :18  // from (0,-2) to (1,-2): dx=1, dy=0? or (1,-2) is at x=1,y= -2, from (0,-2) to (1,-2): right move, dx=1, dy=0

12. (2,-2) :19  // from (1,-2) to (2,-2): dx=1, dy=0

So the moves are: from start, move north (dy+1) for 3 cells: from y= -1 to y=2, but in steps: from (2,-1) to (2,0) dy+1, to (2,1) dy+1, to (2,2) dy+1, so 3 cells in +y direction.

Then from (2,2) to (1,2) dx-1, dy0, so west.

Then to (0,2) dx-1, dy0, west.

Then to (-1,1) dx-1, dy-1, southwest.

Then to (-2,0) dx-1, dy-1, southwest.

Then to (-1,-1) dx+1, dy-1, southeast.

Then to (0,-2) dx+1, dy-1, southeast.

Then to (1,-2) dx+1, dy0, east.

Then to (2,-2) dx+1, dy0, east.

So the layer has 12 cells, and the path has different number of cells in each direction.

For general k, layer k has 6k cells.

The path starts at (k, -k+1)

Then moves in +y direction to (k, -k+2), (k, -k+3), ..., up to (k,k) . How many cells? From y= -k+1 to y=k, so number of y-values: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1 = 2k cells? But for k=2, from y= -1 to y=2, values -1,0,1,2, so 4 cells, but 2k=4, yes.

But in the path, it includes the start and end, so from (k,-k+1) to (k,k), with y increasing by 1 each step, so number of steps is (k) - (-k+1) = 2k-1 steps? No, number of cells is number of y-values from -k+1 to k inclusive, which is k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1 = 2k cells.

For k=2, 4 cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)

Then from (k,k) it moves in -x direction to (k-1,k), (k-2,k), ..., down to ( -k+1,k)? For k=2, from (2,2) to (1,2), then to (0,2), so to x=0, which is -k+2? -2+2=0, so to ( -k+2, k) = (0,2) for k=2.

Number of cells: from x=k to x= -k+2, with x decreasing by 1, so x-values: k, k-1, ..., -k+2

Number: k - (-k+2) +1 = k +k -2 +1 = 2k-1 cells? For k=2, x=2,1,0, so 3 cells, 2*2-1=3, yes.

But this includes the start (k,k) and end ( -k+2,k)

Then from ( -k+2,k) it moves in the direction dx= -1, dy= -1, southwest, to cells like ( -k+1,k-1), ( -k,k-2), etc.

For k=2, from (0,2) to (-1,1), then to (-2,0)

So cells: (-1,1), (-2,0)

Number: 2 cells for k=2.

General: from ( -k+2,k) to ( -k, k - 2)? For k=2, from (0,2) to (-2,0), with steps dx= -1, dy= -1, so after one step to (-1,1), after two steps to (-2,0), so to ( -k, k - 2k +2)? At (-2,0) = ( -k, 0) = ( -k, k - 2) since k=2, 2-2=0.

So to ( -k, k - 2)

Number of cells: from ( -k+2,k) to ( -k, k-2), with each step dx= -1, dy= -1, so the number of steps is the change in x or y, change in x from -k+2 to -k, delta x = -2, so 2 steps, number of cells = 3? Start, after first step, after second step, so 3 cells? But for k=2, we have only two cells: (-1,1) and (-2,0), but the start (0,2) is already counted in the previous segment.

In the path, the cell ( -k+2,k) is the last of the previous segment, so the new segment starts from the next cell.

For k=2, after (0,2), next is (-1,1), then (-2,0), so two cells.

General: from x= -k+2, y=k to x= -k, y=k-2, with each step dx= -1, dy= -1, so the number of steps is the change in x: from -k+2 to -k, delta x = -2, so 2 steps, number of cells = 2 (since each step to a new cell).

For k=2, 2 cells: (-1,1), (-2,0)

Then from ( -k, k-2) = (-2,0) for k=2, it moves in dx=+1, dy= -1, southeast, to ( -k+1, k-3), etc.

For k=2, from (-2,0) to (-1,-1), then to (0,-2)? From (-2,0) to (-1,-1): dx=1, dy= -1, southeast.

Then to (0,-2): dx=1, dy= -1, southeast.

So cells: (-1,-1), (0,-2)

Number: 2 cells.

General: to ( -k +2, k -4)? At (0,-2) = (0, 2-4) = ( -k+2, k-4) for k=2.

Number of cells: from ( -k, k-2) to ( -k+2, k-4), delta x = +2, delta y = -2, so 2 steps, 2 cells.

Then from ( -k+2, k-4) = (0,-2) for k=2, it moves in +x direction, east, to ( -k+3, k-4), etc.

For k=2, from (0,-2) to (1,-2), then to (2,-2)

Cells: (1,-2), (2,-2)

Number: 2 cells.

General: to (k, k-4)? For k=2, to (2,-2) = (k, k-4) since 2-4= -2.

Number of cells: from x= -k+2 to x=k, delta x = 2k-2, so number of cells = 2k-1? But for k=2, from x=0 to x=2, cells at x=0,1,2, so 3 cells, but we have only two: (1,-2), (2,-2), and (0,-2) is already included.

After (0,-2), next is (1,-2), then (2,-2), so two cells for this segment.

Start at ( -k+2, k-4) = (0,-2), then to (1,-2), (2,-2), so to x=k, y=k-4.

Number of cells: from x= -k+2 to x=k, with x increasing by 1, so x-values: -k+2, -k+3, ..., k

Number: k - (-k+2) +1 = k +k -2 +1 = 2k-1 cells? For k=2, x=0,1,2, 3 cells, but in our path, only two cells after (0,-2), but (0,-2) is the start of this segment, so cells: (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) — three cells.

In the list for k=2, after the southeast move to (0,-2), then it moves east to (1,-2), then to (2,-2), so cells 10,11,12 in the layer: position 10: (0,-2):17, 11: (1,-2):18, 12: (2,-2):19, yes, three cells.

But earlier I said from (0,-2) to (1,-2) to (2,-2), so three cells including start.

For the east move, from ( -k+2, k-4) to (k, k-4), with x from -k+2 to k, number of cells: (k) - (-k+2) +1 = 2k -2 +1 = 2k-1 cells.

For k=2, 3 cells: (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)

Now for k=2, total cells: first segment +y: 4 cells (x=k=2, y from -1 to 2)

Second segment -x: 3 cells (y=k=2, x from 2 to 0)

Third segment sw: 2 cells (dx-1,dy-1) from (0,2) to (-2,0)

Fourth segment se: 2 cells (dx+1,dy-1) from (-2,0) to (0,-2)? From (-2,0) to (-1,-1) to (0,-2), so to (0,-2)

Then fifth segment +x: 3 cells from (0,-2) to (2,-2)

Sum: 4+3+2+2+3 = 14, but should be 12, too many.

Mistake in counting.

For k=2:

- seg1: (2,-1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) — 4 cells

- seg2: from (2,2) to (1,2), (0,2) — but (2,2) is already included, so new cells: (1,2), (0,2) — 2 cells? But earlier I said 3 cells including start, but start is already in seg1.

In the path, the cells are visited in sequence, so seg1: cells 1 to 4: (2,-1) to (2,2)

Then seg2: cell 5: (1,2), cell 6: (0,2) — so 2 cells, since (2,2) is already done.

Then seg3: cell 7: (-1,1), cell 8: (-2,0) — 2 cells

Then seg4: cell 9: (-1,-1), cell 10: (0,-2) — 2 cells

Then seg5: cell 11: (1,-2), cell 12: (2,-2) — 2 cells

Sum 4+2+2+2+2=12, good.

For seg2: from (2,2) to (0,2), with x decreasing, y constant, cells at (1,2), (0,2), so from x=k-1 down to x= -k+2? For k=2, x from 1 to 0, so x=k-1=1 to x=0= -k+2? -2+2=0, yes.

Number of cells: x from k-1 down to -k+2, inclusive, with step -1, so number = (k-1) - (-k+2) +1 = k-1 +k-2 +1 = 2k-2

For k=2, 4-2=2, yes.

Seg3: from (0,2) = ( -k+2, k) to ( -k, k-2), with dx= -1, dy= -1 each step.

Start at ( -k+2, k), end at ( -k, k-2)

Delta x = -2, delta y = -2, so number of steps = 2 (since |delta x| =2, and each step dx= -1, dy= -1), so number of cells = 2 (the cells after the start).

For k=2, cells 7 and 8: (-1,1), (-2,0)

General: number of cells in seg3: 2 for all k? But for larger k, may be more.

For example k=3, seg3 should have more cells.

From ( -k+2, k) to ( -k, k-2), with each step dx= -1, dy= -1, so after s steps, at ( -k+2 -s, k - s)

Set equal to ( -k, k-2), so -k+2 -s = -k => 2 -s =0 => s=2

k - s = k-2, good.

So after 2 steps, at ( -k, k-2), so the cells are: after first step: ( -k+2 -1, k -1) = ( -k+1, k-1)

After second step: ( -k+1 -1, k-1 -1) = ( -k, k-2)

So two cells: ( -k+1, k-1) and ( -k, k-2)

For any k, seg3 has 2 cells.

Similarly, seg4: from ( -k, k-2) to ( -k+2, k-4), with dx=+1, dy= -1

After s steps: from ( -k, k-2) to ( -k + s, k-2 - s)

Set to ( -k+2, k-4), so -k + s = -k+2 => s=2

k-2 -s = k-2-2 = k-4, good.

So cells: after first step: ( -k+1, k-3)

After second step: ( -k+2, k-4)

So two cells: ( -k+1, k-3) and ( -k+2, k-4)

For k=2: (-1,-1), (0,-2) as in our list.

Then seg5: from ( -k+2, k-4) to (k, k-4), with dx=+1, dy=0, so east.

Start at ( -k+2, k-4), end at (k, k-4)

X from -k+2 to k, inclusive, step +1.

Number of cells: k - (-k+2) +1 = 2k -2 +1 = 2k-1

For k=2: x from 0 to 2, cells (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) — 3 cells.

But in our earlier for k=2, we have only two cells in seg5: cell 11 and 12: (1,-2), (2,-2), but missing (0,-2), which is already in seg4 as the last cell.

In seg4, last cell is ( -k+2, k-4) = (0,-2) for k=2.

Then seg5 starts from the next cell, so from (0,-2) is already placed, so next is (1,-2), then (2,-2), so two cells for seg5.

For general k, seg5 has cells from x= -k+3 to x=k, y= k-4, so number = k - (-k+3) +1 = 2k -3 +1 = 2k-2

For k=2, 4-2=2 cells: (1,-2), (2,-2)

Yes.

Now for k=2, total:
seg1: y from -k+1 to k, x=k, number of y-values: k - (-k+1) +1 = 2k, cells: 4 for k=2
seg2: x from k-1 down to -k+2, number: (k-1) - (-k+2) +1 = 2k-2, cells: 2 for k=2
seg3: 2 cells
seg4: 2 cells
seg5: 2k-2 cells, for k=2, 2 cells
Sum: 2k + (2k-2) +2 +2 + (2k-2) = 6k -2, but for k=2, 12, 6*2-2=10, not 12.

Inconsistency.

For seg1: 2k cells? 4 for k=2
seg2: 2k-2 =2 cells? for k=2
seg3:2 cells
seg4:2 cells
seg5:2k-2=2 cells for k=2
Sum 4+2+2+2+2=12, and 2k + (2k-2) +2+2+(2k-2) = 6k -2, for k=2, 12-2=10, but we have 12, so mistake.

2k + (2k-2) +2 +2 + (2k-2) = 6k -2, but should be 6k, so off by 2.

For larger k, seg1 has 2k cells, but for k=1, layer 1 has 6 cells, seg1 should be from (1,0) to (1,1)? But in our earlier for layer 1, it has only one cell in "seg1" if we define, but it's different.

For layer k, the number of cells in each segment may depend on k.

From the path, for general k, the segments are:

1. North: from (k, -k+1) to (k,k), y from -k+1 to k, step +1 in y, so number of cells: [k - (-k+1)] /1 +1 = 2k -1 +1 = 2k cells.

2. West: from (k-1,k) to ( -k+2,k), x from k-1 down to -k+2, step -1 in x, number: [(k-1) - (-k+2)] /1 +1 = (k-1 +k-2) +1 = 2k-2 cells.

3. Southwest: from ( -k+1, k-1) to ( -k, k-2), but in the path, after the west segment, the next cell is ( -k+1, k-1), then ( -k, k-2)

For example k=2, after (0,2), next is (-1,1), then (-2,0)

So cells: ( -k+1, k-1), ( -k, k-2)

So 2 cells.

4. Southeast: from ( -k+1, k-3) to ( -k+2, k-4)? For k=2, after (-2,0), next is (-1,-1), then (0,-2)

Cells: ( -k+1, k-3), ( -k+2, k-4)

For k=2: (-1,-1), (0,-2)

2 cells.

5. East: from ( -k+3, k-4) to (k, k-4), x from -k+3 to k, step +1, number: [k - (-k+3)] +1 = 2k-3+1 = 2k-2 cells.

For k=2: x from -2+3=1 to 2, cells (1,-2), (2,-2), 2 cells.

Sum: seg1: 2k, seg2: 2k-2, seg3:2, seg4:2, seg5:2k-2

Sum: 2k + 2k-2 +2 +2 +2k-2 = 6k -2, but should be 6k, so missing 2 cells.

For k>2, there are more segments or more cells.

For k=3, layer 3 has 18 cells.

Start at (3, -3+1) = (3,-2)

Then north to (3,-1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — 6 cells? y from -2 to 3, 6 values, 6 cells.

Then west to (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) — x from 2 down to 0, 3 cells.

Then southwest to (-1,2), (-2,1), (-3,0) — cells: after (0,3), next is (-1,2), then (-2,1), then (-3,0) — so 3 cells: (-1,2), (-2,1), (-3,0)

Then southeast to (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0,-3) — from (-3,0) to (-2,-1), then (-1,-2), then (0,-3) — 3 cells.

Then east to (1,-3), (2,-3), (3,-3) — from (0,-3) to (1,-3), (2,-3), (3,-3) — 3 cells.

Sum: 6+3+3+3+3=18, good.

So for k=3, seg1: 6 cells (2k=6)
 seg2: 3 cells (2k-3? 6-3=3, but 2k-3 for k=3 is 3, yes)
 seg3: 3 cells
 seg4: 3 cells
 seg5: 3 cells

But for seg2: 2k-3 =3 for k=3
 seg3:3, seg4:3, seg5:3

Sum 6+3+3+3+3=18.

For k=2, 2k-3=4-3=1, but we had 2 cells for seg2, not 1.

So not consistent.

For seg2: number of cells = 2k-2 for k=2 is 2, for k=3 is 4, but we have 3 for k=3.

Perhaps it's k for seg2, but for k=2, k=2, we have 2 cells, good, for k=3, k=3 cells, good.

Seg3: for k=2, 2 cells, for k=3, 3 cells, so perhaps k cells for seg3.

Seg4: k cells, seg5: k cells.

Then seg1: 2k cells.

Sum: 2k + k + k + k + k = 6k, good.

For k=2: seg1:4, seg2:2, seg3:2, seg4:2, seg5:2, sum 12.

For k=3: seg1:6, seg2:3, seg3:3, seg4:3, seg5:3, sum 18.

Perfect.

Now the cells in each segment:

Seg1: cells with x=k, y from -k+1 to k inclusive. So y = -k+1, -k+2, ..., k. Number 2k cells.

Seg2: cells with y=k, x from k-1 down to -k+2 inclusive. So x = k-1, k-2, ..., -k+2. Number of x-values: (k-1) - (-k+2) +1 = 2k-2, but we said k cells, for k=2, 2 cells, 2k-2=2, for k=3, 2*3-2=4, but we need 3 cells, contradiction.

For k=3, seg2: x from 2 down to 0, so x=2,1,0, but x=2,y=3 is already in seg1? No, seg1 has x=k=3, y from -2 to 3, so (3,y), not (2,3).

So seg2: (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) — x=2,1,0, so from x=k-1=2 down to x=0= -k+3? -3+3=0, not -k+2=1.

For k=3, -k+2= -1, but we have down to 0.

So general: for seg2, x from k-1 down to -k+3? For k=3, -3+3=0, yes.

Number of cells: (k-1) - (-k+3) +1 = k-1 +k-3 +1 = 2k-3

For k=3, 6-3=3, good.

For k=2, 4-3=1, but we have 2 cells, not good.

For seg2, x from k-1 down to -k+2, for k=2, from 1 down to 0, cells (1,2), (0,2), 2 cells, and 2k-2=2 for k=2, 2k-3=1 not.

So for seg2, number of cells = 2k-2 for k>=2, but for k=1, layer 1 is different.

Since k>=1, and for k=1, we handle separately, but for our purpose k=26>1.

For seg2: cells with y=k, x from k-1 down to -k+2 inclusive.

Number: (k-1) - (-k+2) +1 = k-1 +k-2 +1 = 2k-2

For k=2, 2 cells; k=3, 4 cells, but for k=3, we have only 3 cells: (2,3),(1,3),(0,3), not 4.

So still not.

From the examples, for seg2, the x-range is from k-1 down to 0 for k=2 and k=3, but for k=2, down to 0, for k=3, down to 0, but 0 = -k + k, not constant.

In both cases, down to x=0.

For k=2, from x=1 to x=0
For k=3, from x=2 to x=0

So from x=k-1 down to 0 inclusive.

Number of cells: (k-1) - 0 +1 = k

For k=2, 2 cells; k=3, 3 cells, good.

And 0 = -k + k, but for general, it's down to x=0.

But for larger k, is it down to x=0 or to -k+2 or what.

For k=4, layer 4 has 24 cells.

Seg1: x=4, y from -4+1= -3 to 4, so y= -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4, 8 cells.

Seg2: y=4, x from 3 down to 0, so x=3,2,1,0, 4 cells.

Seg3: southwest: from (0,4) to next: likely ( -1,3), then ( -2,2), then ( -3,1), then ( -4,0) — so 4 cells: (-1,3), (-2,2), (-3,1), (-4,0)

Seg4: southeast: from (-4,0) to (-3,-1), (-2,-2), (-1,-3), (0,-4) — 4 cells.

Seg5: east: from (0,-4) to (1,-4), (2,-4), (3,-4), (4,-4) — 5 cells? But should be k=4 cells, but 5.

Cells: (1,-4), (2,-4), (3,-4), (4,-4) — 4 cells, since (0,-4) is already in seg4.

So seg5: x from 1 to 4, y= -4, 4 cells.

Sum: seg1:8, seg2:4, seg3:4, seg4:4, seg5:4, sum 24, good.

So for seg2: x from k-1 down to 0, number k cells.

Seg3: cells with dx= -1, dy= -1, from ( -1, k-1) to (
