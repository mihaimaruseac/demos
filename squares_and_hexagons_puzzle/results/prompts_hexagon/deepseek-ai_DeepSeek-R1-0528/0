<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on the hex grid.

From the snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc. But in a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors, so around 1, there should be six numbers. Looking at the diagram, around 1, we have 2,3,4,5,6,7? Let's see:

In the second row: 15,5,1,2,9

Third row: 16,6,7,8

First row: 14,4,3,10

So, relative to 1:

- Above-left: 14? But 14 is above, and 4 is left of it? I need to interpret the grid properly.

In a hexagonal grid, rows are offset. Typically, in a hex grid, adjacent rows are shifted by half a cell. Looking at the numbers:

Directly above 1 is probably 5? The row above has 15,5,1,2,9 but that seems messy. Perhaps the center is 1, and then the ring around it is numbers 2 to 7, but here it shows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 which are more than six.

Let me list the neighbors of 1. From the grid, cells adjacent to 1 should be those sharing an edge with it.

Looking at the positions:

Assume 1 is at center.

To its right: 2 (since in the same row, 1 then 2)

To its left: probably 5? In the row, it's 15,5,1,2,9 so left of 1 is 5.

But 5 is left, 2 is right. Then above: in the row above, it's 14,4,3,10. But 4 and 3 are above? Perhaps directly above is 4? But 4 is not directly above if rows are offset.

In a hex grid, each cell has neighbors in six directions: N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW.

I need to define the coordinate system.

Perhaps I can see the sequence. The spiral starts at 1, then moves to adjacent cells.

Start at 1.

Then probably moves to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right or something), but in the diagram, after 1 is 2, then above 2 is 3? Let's see the sequence.

From the diagram, reading order might not be sequential.

The numbers are placed in spiral order, so I should figure out the path of the spiral.

Start at 1.

The next number is 2. Where is 2 relative to 1? From the grid, in the same row, to the right of 1 is 2.

Then 3 is above 2? In the top row, 3 is to the left of 10, but 10 is further.

Look at the positions:

Row 1: 14,4,3,10 — but this might be incomplete.

Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9

Row 3: 16,6,7,8

So, let's assume row 2 is the central row, with 1 at center.

Then, left of 1 is 5, right is 2.

Below 1, in row 3, we have 16,6,7,8. Directly below 1 should be 6? Since 6 is below and left or something.

Typically in hex grids, rows are offset. So for row 2 (central), cells are at x=0,1,2,... but with y even or odd offset.

To simplify, let's list the neighbors of 1 based on the diagram.

Cell with 1: neighbors should be cells adjacent.

- To the right: 2 (same row, adjacent)

- To the left: 5 (same row, adjacent)

- Below: probably 6, since in row 3, 6 is below and slightly left or right? In the sequence, after 1 is 2, then 3, but 3 is not adjacent to 1 directly? Let's see the spiral path.

Perhaps the spiral goes: from 1 to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right), then to 4 (up-left), then to 5 (left), then to 6 (down-left), then to 7 (down-right), then to 8 (right), etc.

Let's check with the diagram.

From 1, right to 2.

Then from 2, if up-right to 3, which is in the top row, 3 is there.

Then from 3, up-left to 4? 4 is to the left of 3 in the top row.

Then from 4, left to? but next is 5, which is below 4? In the diagram, below 4 is 5? Row 1 has 14,4,3,10 — so 4 is in row 1, 5 is in row 2, left of 1.

So from 4 (row1), down to 5 (row2), which is left of 1.

Then from 5, left to? but next number is 6, which is below 5? Row 3 has 16,6,7,8, so 6 is below 5.

From 5 to 6 down.

Then from 6 to 7 right? Since 7 is to the right of 6 in row 3.

Then from 7 to 8 right? 8 is further right.

But after 8 should be 9, which is in row 2, right of 2? Row 2 has 15,5,1,2,9 so 9 is right of 2.

From 7 to 8 to 9, but 9 is not adjacent to 8? In row 3 is 7,8, then row 2 has 9, but row 2 is above row 3, so from 8 down-right or up-right? Probably up-right to 9.

Similarly, then to 10, which is in row 1, right of 3? Row 1 has 14,4,3,10, so 10 is right of 3.

And so on.

So the neighbors of 1 are: right:2, left:5, and then below:6? But also above:3? And down-right:7? Let's list adjacent cells.

From positions:

- Right: 2

- Left: 5

- Above-right: 3? Since 3 is above and right of 1? In hex grid, if rows are offset, directly above might be different.

From the movement: from 1 to 2 right, then 2 to 3 up-right, so 3 is adjacent to 2 and to 1? In hex grid, if you move up-right from a cell, it might not be adjacent to the previous cell's left, but in this case, since it's a spiral, likely the cells are adjacent.

Assume that the grid is such that each step is to an adjacent cell.

So for cell 1, its neighbors should be the cells it is adjacent to, which are filled next or before, but since it's spiral, the immediate neighbors are filled first in the ring.

In the first ring around 1, numbers 2 through 7 should be the neighbors, but here we have 2,3,4,5,6,7, and then 8 is also there, but 8 is adjacent to 7, and 9 to 8, etc.

In the diagram, around 1, we have 2,5,6,7, and 3 and 4 are above, but are they adjacent?

Let's see distance. In hex grid, distance is based on axial coordinates or something.

I could assign coordinates.

Set up a coordinate system for hexagonal grid.

Commonly, use axial coordinates q and r, with s = -q-r, but perhaps cube coordinates.

Set the center cell 1 at (0,0,0) in cube coordinates, where x+y+z=0.

Then neighbors are at (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1).

Now, from the spiral path, we can assign which number is at which coordinate.

Start at (0,0,0) with 1.

Then move to the next cell. Typically in spirals, it moves in a direction and turns.

From the diagram, it moves right to 2. Right in hex grid might be along the x-axis or something.

Assume that "right" is the +q direction or something.

Set the direction from 1 to 2 as the positive x-direction in cube coords.

So cell 2 is at (1,0,-1).

Then from 2, it moves to 3. From the diagram, 3 is above-right, which might be the y-direction or z.

In cube coords, from (1,0,-1), moving "up-right" could be to (1,-1,0) or to (0,-1,1), etc.

In the diagram, from 2 to 3, and 3 is adjacent to 1, so if 1 is at (0,0,0), 2 at (1,0,-1), then neighbors of 1 include (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), etc.

The cell at (1,-1,0) should be adjacent to both 1 and 2, since distance to 1 is |1-0| + |-1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2? No, in cube coords, distance is max(|dx|,|dy|,|dz|) or half the sum of absolute differences? I think I recall wrong.

In cube coordinates for hex grids, the distance between two hexes is (|dx| + |dy| + |dz|)/2, and since x+y+z=0, it's consistent.

For example, from (0,0,0) to (1,0,-1): |1-0| + |0-0| + |-1-0| =1+0+1=2, divided by 2 is 1, so adjacent.

Similarly, to (1,-1,0): |1-0| + |-1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, /2=1, adjacent.

And (1,-1,0) is adjacent to (1,0,-1) because |1-1| + |-1-0| + |0-(-1)| =0+1+1=2,/2=1.

So yes, (1,-1,0) is adjacent to both (0,0,0) and (1,0,-1).

In the diagram, 3 is adjacent to both 1 and 2, so likely 3 is at (1,-1,0).

Then from 3, it moves to 4. From diagram, 4 is left of 3 or up-left. In row 1, 4 is left of 3, so probably to (0,-1,1) or something.

From (1,-1,0), moving left might be to (0,-1,1)? Since q decreases.

(0,-1,1) is adjacent to (1,-1,0)? |0-1| + |-1-(-1)| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2,/2=1, yes.

And (0,-1,1) is also adjacent to (0,0,0)? |0-0| + |-1-0| + |1-0| =0+1+1=2,/2=1, yes.

So 4 at (0,-1,1).

Then from 4 to 5. In diagram, 5 is below 4. From (0,-1,1) to where? Down could be to (0,0,0) but that's occupied, or to (-1,0,1) or something.

Adjacent cells: neighbors of (0,-1,1) are: (1,-1,0), (1,-2,1)? Let's compute.

General neighbor: add vectors: (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1).

So for (0,-1,1):

- (1,0,-1) + (0,-1,1) = (1,-1,0) — already 3

- (1,-1,0) + (0,-1,1) = (1,-2,1)

- (0,-1,1) + (0,-1,1) = (0,-2,2) — but x+y+z=0? 0-2+2=0 ok, but distance?

Better: the neighbors are obtained by adding the direction vectors.

So from (q,r,s) = (0,-1,1), neighbors:

Add (1,0,-1): (1,-1,0) — occupied by 3

Add (1,-1,0): (1,-2,1)

Add (0,-1,1): (0,-2,2)

Add (-1,0,1): (-1,-1,2)

Add (-1,1,0): (-1,0,1)

Add (0,1,-1): (0,0,0) — occupied by 1

Now, in diagram, 5 is at (-1,0,1)? Since left of 1 in row 2.

Row 2 has 15,5,1,2,9. Assuming 1 at (0,0,0), 2 at (1,0,-1), 5 at left, so probably (-1,0,1).

And (-1,0,1) is adjacent to (0,-1,1)? | -1-0 | + |0-(-1)| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2,/2=1, yes adjacent.

Also adjacent to (0,0,0): | -1-0 | + |0-0| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2,/2=1.

So 5 at (-1,0,1).

Then from 5 to 6. In diagram, 6 is below 5. Row 3 has 16,6,7,8, so below 5 should be 6.

From (-1,0,1), move down. Down could be to (-1,1,0) or (0,1,-1), etc.

Adjacent cells: add vectors.

Add (1,0,-1): (0,0,0) — occupied

Add (1,-1,0): (0,-1,1) — occupied by 4

Add (0,-1,1): (-1,-1,2)

Add (-1,0,1): (-2,0,2)

Add (-1,1,0): (-2,1,1)? (-1+(-1),0+1,1+0)=(-2,1,1), sum -2+1+1=0 ok.

Add (0,1,-1): (-1,1,0)

Now, in diagram, 6 is below, probably at (-1,1,0), since row 3 is below row 2.

And (-1,1,0) is adjacent to (-1,0,1): | -1-(-1) | + |1-0| + |0-1| =0+1+1=2,/2=1.

Also adjacent to (0,0,0): | -1-0 | + |1-0| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2,/2=1.

So 6 at (-1,1,0).

Then from 6 to 7. In diagram, 7 is to the right of 6 in row 3.

So probably to (0,1,-1).

Adjacent: from (-1,1,0) add (1,0,-1): (0,1,-1)

Yes, and (0,1,-1) is adjacent to (-1,1,0) and to (0,0,0)? |0-0| + |1-0| + |-1-0| =0+1+1=2,/2=1, yes.

So 7 at (0,1,-1).

Then from 7 to 8. In diagram, 8 is right of 7, so to (1,1,-2)? From (0,1,-1) add (1,0,-1): (1,1,-2)

Adjacent: |1-0| + |1-1| + |-2-(-1)| =1+0+1=2,/2=1.

And sum 1+1-2=0.

So 8 at (1,1,-2).

Then from 8 to 9. In diagram, 9 is above-right, in row 2, right of 2.

Row 2 has 15,5,1,2,9, so right of 2 is 9.

2 is at (1,0,-1), so right could be to (2,0,-2) or up-right to (1,-1,0) but occupied.

From (1,1,-2), move to where? Adjacent cells: add vectors.

Add (1,0,-1): (2,1,-3)

Add (1,-1,0): (2,0,-2)

Add (0,-1,1): (1,0,-1) — occupied by 2

Add (-1,0,1): (0,1,-1) — occupied by 7

Add (-1,1,0): (0,2,-2)

Add (0,1,-1): (1,2,-3)

Now, 9 should be adjacent to 2, since in same row and adjacent? Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9, so between 2 and 9, probably adjacent.

2 is at (1,0,-1), so 9 might be at (2,0,-2), since right of 2.

And (2,0,-2) is adjacent to (1,0,-1)? |2-1| + |0-0| + |-2-(-1)| =1+0+1=2,/2=1, yes.

And adjacent to (1,1,-2)? |2-1| + |0-1| + |-2-(-2)| =1+1+0=2,/2=1, yes.

So 9 at (2,0,-2).

Then to 10, which is in row 1, right of 3? Row 1: 14,4,3,10, so right of 3.

3 is at (1,-1,0), so right could be (2,-1,-1).

Adjacent to 3? |2-1| + |-1-(-1)| + |-1-0| =1+0+1=2,/2=1.

And to 9? |2-2| + |-1-0| + |-1-(-2)| =0+1+1=2,/2=1, so adjacent.

So 10 at (2,-1,-1).

And so on.

So now we have the mapping.

Now, the spiral continues, but we need to find the position of 2026.

Since it's a spiral, the numbers are filled in rings around the center.

Each "ring" k consists of hexagons at distance k from center.

Distance in hex grid is the minimum number of steps, which in cube coords is (|dx| + |dy| + |dz|)/2.

Since center is (0,0,0), distance d = (|x| + |y| + |z|)/2.

And since x+y+z=0, it's well-defined.

The number of hexagons at distance d is 6d for d >=1, since each ring has 6d cells.

For d=0: 1 cell (center)

d=1: 6 cells

d=2: 12 cells? 6*2=12

d=3: 18 cells, etc.

In general, ring d has 6d cells for d >=1.

The total number of cells up to distance d is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+d) = 1 + 6*(d(d+1)/2) = 1 + 3d(d+1)

Sum from k=1 to d of 6k = 6 * d(d+1)/2 = 3d(d+1)

Plus center 1, so total cells within distance d: 1 + 3d(d+1)

Now, we need to find where 2026 is.

So solve for d such that total cells <= 2026.

Set 1 + 3d(d+1) <= 2026

3d(d+1) <= 2025

d(d+1) <= 675

d^2 + d - 675 <= 0

Solve quadratic: d = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let's see, 52^2=2704, 2704-3=2701, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97, since 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 2601+100=2701? 51.9^2= (52-0.1)^2=2704 - 2*52*0.1 + 0.01=2704-10.4+0.01=2693.61, too low.

51.97^2= (52 - 0.03)^2=2704 - 2*52*0.03 + (0.03)^2=2704 - 3.12 + 0.0009≈2700.8809

2701 - 2700.8809=0.1191, so approx 51.97 + 0.1191/(2*51.97)≈51.97 + 0.1191/103.94≈51.97 + 0.001145≈51.971145

So d ≈ [-1 + 51.971]/2 ≈ 50.971/2 ≈ 25.4855

So d max when total <=2026 is d=25, since d must be integer.

Check d=25: total cells = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

d=26: 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

1951 < 2026 < 2107, so 2026 is in ring d=26.

Ring d has cells at distance d, so ring 26 has distance 26.

Total cells up to d=25 is 1951, so the numbers from 1952 to 2107 are in ring 26.

Number of cells in ring 26: 6*26 = 156 cells.

Total up to d=25: 1951

So first cell in ring 26 is 1952, last is 1951 + 156 = 2107, yes.

2026 - 1951 = 75, so it's the 75th cell in ring 26.

Since ring starts at 1952, so index in ring: 2026 - 1951 = 75? 1952 is first, so position k=1 to 156.

2026 - 1951 = 75, but since 1952 is the first, so 1952 is k=1, 1953 is k=2, ..., so 2026 is k = 2026 - 1951 = 75? 2026 - 1951 = 75, but 1951 is the last of previous ring, so 1952 is position 1, so 2026 is position 2026 - 1951 = 75? 2026 - 1951 = 75, but that would be the offset from the end of previous ring, so yes, k=75 in the ring.

2026 - 1951 = 75, but since 1952 is the first cell of ring, its index is 1, so 2026 is index k = 75? Let's compute: cell number = 1951 + k, so for k=1, 1952; k=2,1953; ... k=75, 1951+75=2026, yes.

So k=75 in ring d=26.

Now, ring d=26 has 6*26=156 cells.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with d cells? Since it's a hexagon, each side has d cells, but since corners are shared, total cells: for a hexagon of side length d, number of cells is 6*d, but each corner is part of one side, so yes, exactly 6d cells, with d cells per side.

In this case, d=26, so each side has 26 cells.

The spiral starts at a particular point and goes around.

We need to know where the ring starts and in which direction.

From the initial placement, we can see.

In ring d=1, which is distance 1, cells: we have 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In our earlier assignment:

1 at (0,0,0)

2 at (1,0,-1)

3 at (1,-1,0)

4 at (0,-1,1)

5 at (-1,0,1)

6 at (-1,1,0)

7 at (0,1,-1)

Now, the spiral direction: from center, it went to 2 at (1,0,-1), which is the "east" direction.

Then to 3 at (1,-1,0), which is "northeast".

Then to 4 at (0,-1,1), "northwest".

Then to 5 at (-1,0,1), "west".

Then to 6 at (-1,1,0), "southwest".

Then to 7 at (0,1,-1), "southeast".

Now, for the next ring, d=2, it should start after 7.

After 7, it went to 8 at (1,1,-2), which is adjacent to 7.

7 is at (0,1,-1), moved to (1,1,-2), which is in the direction of increasing x, same y,z? From (0,1,-1) to (1,1,-2), which is adding (1,0,-1), so "east" direction.

But in the spiral, after completing the first ring, it should move to the next ring.

Typically, after placing 7, which is at (0,1,-1), it might move to a cell adjacent to it and to the next ring.

In this case, it moved to 8 at (1,1,-2).

Now, distance from center: for (1,1,-2), |1|+|1|+|-2|=4,/2=2, so distance 2.

Adjacent to 7 at (0,1,-1), distance 1.

Now, the direction: from 7, it moved in the same direction as from 1 to 2? From 1 to 2 was to (1,0,-1), which is east.

From 7 to 8 is to (1,1,-2), which is also east direction? Adding (1,0,-1).

But 7 is at (0,1,-1), so moving east to (1,1,-2).

In the ring, it might start at a corner.

For ring d, it starts at the "southeast" corner or something? Let's see the sequence.

In ring d=2, cells: numbers 8 to 19? Total up to d=1 is 7, so ring d=2: 8 to 7 + 12 =19? 6*2=12 cells, yes, 8 to 19.

We have 8 at (1,1,-2)

Then 9 at (2,0,-2) — earlier we had

9 at (2,0,-2)

10 at (2,-1,-1)

11? Then 12,13,etc.

From 8 to 9: to (2,0,-2), which is from (1,1,-2) to (2,0,-2)? Adding (1,-1,0)? So northwest direction? In cube coords, adding (1,-1,0) is decreasing y, increasing x.

But earlier movements: from 8 to 9, in diagram, 9 is above-left? From row 3 to row 2.

In our earlier, 8 at (1,1,-2), 9 at (2,0,-2)

Vector: (2-1,0-1,-2-(-2)) = (1,-1,0)

So adding (1,-1,0), which is the "northwest" direction? In standard hex directions, adding (1,-1,0) might be northwest.

Then from 9 to 10: 10 at (2,-1,-1)

From (2,0,-2) to (2,-1,-1): adding (0,-1,1)? So "north" direction? Adding (0,-1,1).

Then probably continues.

But for the spiral, in each ring, it starts at a particular point and moves in directions.

Typically, for hexagonal spiral, after completing a ring, it moves to the next ring by moving in the direction of the last step or something.

In this case, the last step of ring d=1 was to 7 at (0,1,-1), and it moved east to 8 at (1,1,-2).

Now, (1,1,-2) is at distance 2, and it's in the direction of the "southeast" side or something.

To generalize, the ring d starts at the cell that is d steps east from center? Center is (0,0,0), d steps east is (d,0,-d).

But for d=1, it started at (1,0,-1), which is east.

For d=2, it started at (1,1,-2)? But (2,0,-2) would be two east, but it started at (1,1,-2), which is not (2,0,-2).

(1,1,-2) is distance (|1|+|1|+|-2|)/2=4/2=2, same.

But the starting point: for ring d, it might start at (d,0,-d) but for d=2, (2,0,-2) is where 9 is, but 8 is before that.

In sequence, 8 is first in ring d=2, at (1,1,-2), then 9 at (2,0,-2), etc.

Now, (1,1,-2) = (d, d-1, -d -d +1)? d=2, (2,1,-3)? No.

Note that from center, moving d steps in a direction.

The starting point of ring d is obtained by moving d steps in the direction perpendicular to the side, but it's messy.

Notice the coordinates.

For ring d, the starting cell is at (d, -d+1, -1)? For d=1: (1,-1+1,-1)=(1,0,-1) yes, which is cell 2.

For d=2: (2,-2+1,-1)=(2,-1,-1) but that's where 10 is, but ring starts at 8 which is (1,1,-2).

Not matching.

Perhaps (d-1, d, -2d+1)? d=1: (0,1,-1) but that's cell 7, not start.

Another way: in the spiral, the ring d starts at the cell adjacent to the start of ring d-1 in the "next" direction.

For d=1, start at (1,0,-1)

For d=2, it started at (1,1,-2), which is adjacent to the end of ring d=1? End of ring d=1 is 7 at (0,1,-1), and (1,1,-2) is adjacent, as we saw.

And the direction from end to start: from (0,1,-1) to (1,1,-2), which is adding (1,0,-1), same as the initial direction from center to first cell: from (0,0,0) to (1,0,-1) was also add (1,0,-1).

So the transition between rings is by moving in the same "east" direction.

Moreover, after moving to the start of the next ring, it continues in the same direction as it was going, but since it just moved east, and previously it was moving southeast or something.

In ring d=1, it ended at (0,1,-1), which is southeast, and moved east to (1,1,-2).

Then in ring d=2, it moved to (2,0,-2), which is adding (1,-1,0), so northwest? But from the diagram, it was moving to the next cell.

After starting at (1,1,-2), it moves in a direction that is not east; it moved to (2,0,-2), which is northwest.

But in the spiral path, it should follow the perimeter.

Typically, for a hexagonal spiral, after entering the ring, it moves along the sides.

Each ring has 6 sides, each with d cells.

The spiral traverses each side in order.

The direction it moves depends on the side.

In this case, for ring d, it starts at a corner, and moves in a certain direction for d steps, then turns 60 degrees, and repeats.

The starting corner and direction.

From our earlier, for ring d=1, it started at (1,0,-1), which we can call the "east" corner.

Then it moved to (1,-1,0), which is northeast direction? Adding (0,-1,1)? From (1,0,-1) to (1,-1,0) is adding (0,-1,1)? (1-1, -1-0, 0-(-1)) = (0,-1,1)? Earlier we had vector (0,-1,1), but in cube coords, adding (0,-1,1) would go to (1+0,0-1,-1+1)=(1,-1,0), yes.

But in standard directions, adding (0,-1,1) might be "north" or "northwest", but in our initial, it was up-right.

To avoid confusion, let's define the movement directions.

In ring d, starting at cell S_d.

For d=1, S_1 = (1,0,-1)

Then it moves in direction D1: to (1,-1,0), which is adding vector (0,-1,1)

Then to (0,-1,1), adding (-1,0,1)? From (1,-1,0) to (0,-1,1): add (-1,0,1)

Then to (-1,0,1), add (-1,1,0)? From (0,-1,1) to (-1,0,1): add (-1,1,0)

Then to (-1,1,0), add (0,1,-1)? From (-1,0,1) to (-1,1,0): add (0,1,-1)

Then to (0,1,-1), add (1,0,-1)? From (-1,1,0) to (0,1,-1): add (1,0,-1)

So the movement vectors in order: for each segment: add (0,-1,1), then (-1,0,1), then (-1,1,0), then (0,1,-1), then (1,0,-1), and then? After (0,1,-1), for d=1 it stops, but for higher d, it continues.

In d=1, after moving to (0,1,-1), that's the end.

But for d=2, it starts at (1,1,-2), then moves to (2,0,-2), which is add (1,-1,0)? From (1,1,-2) to (2,0,-2): add (1,-1,0)

But (1,-1,0) is not in the previous list.

Previous vectors were: (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1), (1,0,-1)

But (1,-1,0) is different.

Note that (1,-1,0) = - (-1,1,0), but direction opposite.

In d=2, from start (1,1,-2), add (1,-1,0) to (2,0,-2)

Then probably continue.

From (2,0,-2) to (2,-1,-1): add (0,-1,1)? (2-2, -1-0, -1-(-2)) = (0,-1,1), yes.

Then to (1,-1,-1)? Or what? Earlier we had 10 at (2,-1,-1), then next?

After 10, should be 11,12,etc.

From (2,-1,-1), probably to (1,-2,0) or something.

Add next vector? In sequence, after adding (0,-1,1), similar to first segment.

In d=1, after adding (0,-1,1) to go from S1 to next, then added (-1,0,1)

Here, from (2,0,-2) to (2,-1,-1) by add (0,-1,1)

Then next should be add (-1,0,1) to (1,-1,-1)? (2-1,-1-0,-1-(-1))? Add (-1,0,1) to (2,-1,-1): (1,-1,0)

But earlier for d=1, from (1,-1,0) to (0,-1,1) by add (-1,0,1)? From (1,-1,0) add (-1,0,1) = (0,-1,1), yes.

Here from (2,-1,-1) add (-1,0,1) = (1,-1,0)

Then next add (-1,1,0)? To (1-1,-1+1,0+0)=(0,0,0) occupied, so probably not.

Add (-1,1,0) to (1,-1,0): (0,0,0) center, occupied, but we are in ring d=2, so should go to another cell.

Perhaps to (1,-1,0) is already occupied? In d=1, (1,-1,0) is cell 3, occupied.

But in ring d=2, it should be new cells.

So likely, from (2,-1,-1) add (-1,0,1) to (1,-1,0), but that's occupied, so must be different.

I think I missed a cell.

After (2,-1,-1), next should be to (1,-2,1) or something.

Let's list the cells for ring d=2.

Start at (1,1,-2) - 8

Then to (2,0,-2) - 9

Then to (2,-1,-1) - 10

Then to (1,-2,0) ? Or (1,-1,-1)? 

From diagram, after 10, probably 11 is next, but not shown.

Since it's symmetric, and total 12 cells.

The cells at distance 2: |x|+|y|+|z|=4, x+y+z=0.

Possible: permutations and signs.

List: (2,0,-2), (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,1,-2), (1,0,-1) but dist 1, no.

|x|+|y|+|z|=4, x+y+z=0.

So possibilities: two coordinates magnitude 2, one 0, but sum abs 4, and sum 0.

Cases:

- Two same magnitude, one different.

Set a,b,c with |a|+|b|+|c|=4, a+b+c=0.

Since sum 0, the values must balance.

Possible combinations:

- One coordinate 0, then |a|+|b|=4, a+b=0, so a=2,b=-2 or a=-2,b=2, but c=0.

So (2,-2,0), (-2,2,0), (2,0,-2), (-2,0,2), (0,2,-2), (0,-2,2)

But these are permutations.

(2,-2,0), (2,0,-2), (0,2,-2), (-2,2,0), (-2,0,2), (0,-2,2)

But |2|+|-2|+|0|=4, sum 0.

- Or all non-zero: |a|+|b|+|c|=4, a+b+c=0.

Suppose a,b,c integers, sum abs 4, sum 0.

Possible: values like (3,-1,-2), |3|+|-1|+|-2|=3+1+2=6>4, too big.

(2,-1,-1): |2|+|-1|+|-1|=4, sum 2-1-1=0.

Similarly, (2,-1,-1), and permutations with signs.

(2,-1,-1), sum 0, abs sum 4.

Similarly, (-2,1,1), etc.

Now, permutations: for (2,-1,-1), the values are 2,-1,-1.

But since coordinates, we need to assign to x,y,z.

So for fixed values, the distinct permutations: there are 3 positions for the 2, and then the two -1 can be in any order, but since symmetric, it's 3 choices for where to put 2, and the other two get -1 each.

But since the -1 are identical, it's 3 distinct points: (2,-1,-1), (-1,2,-1), (-1,-1,2)

Similarly for negative: (-2,1,1), (1,-2,1), (1,1,-2)

Now, total: the all distinct magnitude: like (2,-2,0) etc, there are 6 such: as listed above.

Plus the (2,-1,-1) type: 3 for positive 2, and 3 for negative -2? For (2,-1,-1), we have three: (2,-1,-1), (-1,2,-1), (-1,-1,2)

Similarly for (-2,1,1): (-2,1,1), (1,-2,1), (1,1,-2)

But (1,1,-2) is already included? No, different.

So total: the (2,-2,0) type: 6 cells

The (2,-1,-1) type: 3 cells? (2,-1,-1), (-1,2,-1), (-1,-1,2)

And (-2,1,1), (1,-2,1), (1,1,-2) — that's three more.

But (1,1,-2) is one, etc.

Total: 6 + 3 + 3 = 12, good.

Now in our spiral, we have:

8: (1,1,-2)

9: (2,0,-2)

10: (2,-1,-1)

Then next: probably to (2,-2,0) or to (1,-1,-1)? But (1,-1,-1) is not distance 2? |1|+|-1|+|-1|=3,/2=1.5 not integer, distance must be integer, so not.

(2,-2,0): |2|+|-2|+|0|=4,/2=2.

From (2,-1,-1) to (2,-2,0): add (0,-1,1)? (2-2,-2-(-1),0-(-1)) = (0,-1,1), same as before.

So 11 at (2,-2,0)

Then next: from (2,-2,0), add (-1,0,1)? To (1,-2,1)

|1|+|-2|+|1|=4,/2=2.

So 12 at (1,-2,1)

Then next: add (-1,1,0)? To (0,-1,1), but (0,-1,1) is cell 4, distance 1, occupied.

Problem.

Add (-1,1,0) to (1,-2,1): (0,-1,1), occupied.

But should go to another cell, like (0,-2,2) or something.

(0,-2,2): |0|+|-2|+|2|=4,/2=2, sum 0.

Adjacent to (1,-2,1)? |0-1| + |-2-(-2)| + |2-1| =1+0+1=2,/2=1, yes.

So 13 at (0,-2,2)

Then next: add (0,-1,1)? To (0,-3,3), distance |0|+|-3|+|3|=6,/2=3, too far.

After (0,-2,2), add (-1,0,1)? To (-1,-2,3)? | -1|+|-2|+|3|=6,/2=3.

Or add (-1,1,0) to (-1,-1,2)

| -1|+|-1|+|2|=4,/2=2, sum -1-1+2=0.

Adjacent to (0,-2,2)? | -1-0| + |-1-(-2)| + |2-2| =1+1+0=2,/2=1, yes.

So 14 at (-1,-1,2)? But in diagram, row 1 has 14,4,3,10, and 14 is left, so probably (-1,-1,2) or something.

Earlier we didn't assign, but likely.

Then continue.

But for our purpose, we can see the pattern.

Back to the movement.

In ring d, it starts at a cell, and moves in six directions sequentially.

From the initial, for ring d, the starting cell is at (d, -d+1, -1)? For d=1: (1,0,-1) yes.

d=2: (2,-1,-1) but we started at (1,1,-2), not (2,-1,-1).

(2,-1,-1) is cell 10, which is later.

Start is at (1,1,-2) for d=2.

Now, (1,1,-2) = (d, d-1, -2d +1)? d=2, (2,1,-3)? No.

Note that for d=1, start (1,0,-1)

d=2, start (1,1,-2)

d=3, probably (1,2,-3) or (2,1,-3), etc.

Likely (1, d-1, -d) for d>=1? d=1: (1,0,-1) yes.

d=2: (1,1,-2) yes.

d=3: (1,2,-3)

Then distance |1|+|2|+|-3|=6,/2=3, good.

And it should be adjacent to the end of previous ring.

End of ring d-1: for d-1=2, end is last cell of ring 2.

Ring 2 has 12 cells, from 8 to 19.

Last cell: since it ended at (0,1,-1) for d=1, similarly for d=2.

From earlier, we have up to 14 at (-1,-1,2), then continue.

From (-1,-1,2), next add (0,1,-1)? To (-1,0,1), occupied.

Add (-1,1,0) to (-2,0,2)? | -2|+|0|+|2|=4,/2=2.

Adjacent? From (-1,-1,2) add (-1,1,0) = (-2,0,2)

Yes, so 15 at (-2,0,2)? In diagram row 2 has 15,5,1,2,9, and 15 is left, so likely (-2,0,2) or similar.

Then next: add (0,1,-1)? To (-2,1,1)

| -2|+|1|+|1|=4,/2=2, sum -2+1+1=0.

So 16 at (-2,1,1)? In diagram row 3 has 16,6,7,8, so 16 is left, probably (-2,1,1) or (-1,1,0) but occupied.

(-2,1,1) is distance 2.

Then from (-2,1,1) to next, add (1,0,-1)? To (-1,1,0), occupied.

Add (0,1,-1) to (-2,2,0)? | -2|+|2|+|0|=4,/2=2.

Adjacent: | -2-(-2)| + |2-1| + |0-1| =0+1+1=2,/2=1.

So 17 at (-2,2,0)

Then to 18: add (1,-1,0)? To (-1,1,0), occupied.

Add (1,0,-1) to (-1,2,-1)

| -1|+|2|+|-1|=4,/2=2, sum -1+2-1=0.

Adjacent to (-2,2,0)? | -1-(-2)| + |2-2| + |-1-0| =1+0+1=2,/2=1.

So 18 at (-1,2,-1)

Then to 19: add (1,-1,0)? To (0,1,-1), occupied.

Add (0,-1,1) to (-1,1,-1)? Not distance 2.

Add (1,0,-1) to (0,2,-2)

|0|+|2|+|-2|=4,/2=2, sum 0.

Adjacent to (-1,2,-1)? |0-(-1)| + |2-2| + |-2-(-1)| =1+0+1=2,/2=1.

So 19 at (0,2,-2)

Now, end of ring d=2 is 19 at (0,2,-2)

Then for ring d=3, it should start by moving east from here: add (1,0,-1) to (1,2,-3)

Which is (1,2,-3), as we guessed earlier for d=3 start.

And distance |1|+|2|+|-3|=6,/2=3, good.

So pattern: for ring d, starts at (1, d-1, -d)

Then moves in directions: first, it moves in the direction adding (1,-1,0) for d steps? For d=2, from (1,1,-2) add (1,-1,0) to (2,0,-2), which is one step, but d=2, should have d steps? But each side has d cells, but the movement includes the starting cell? No.

In the traversal, when it moves along a side, it places d cells, but the starting cell is already placed, so it moves d-1 times to place d cells? Let's see.

For ring d, number of cells 6d.

It moves in 6 directions, each direction for a side, and each side has d cells.

The movement: from start, it moves in a direction for d steps, but each "step" places a new cell, including the start? Typically, the start is the first cell of the side, then it moves to the next d-1 cells in that direction.

But in our case, for d=2, start at (1,1,-2) - first cell.

Then move to (2,0,-2) - second cell of first side? But d=2, so two cells per side.

Then next direction.

After (2,0,-2), it moves to (2,-1,-1) by adding (0,-1,1), so direction (0,-1,1)

Then to (2,-2,0) - but we had 11 at (2,-2,0), so yes, two cells: (2,0,-2) and (2,-1,-1)? But (2,-1,-1) is one cell, from start of side.

The side starts at (2,0,-2)? But the ring start was at (1,1,-2), which is different.

For the first side, cells: (1,1,-2) and (2,0,-2)? But are they adjacent? |1-2| + |1-0| + |-2-(-2)| =1+1+0=2,/2=1, yes.

And direction from first to second: (2-1,0-1,-2-(-2)) = (1,-1,0)

So first side: direction (1,-1,0), cells: S_d = (1,d-1,-d), then moving in dir (1,-1,0) to (1+1,d-1-1,-d+0) = (2,d-2,-d)

For d=2: (1,1,-2) to (2,0,-2)

Then next cell? But for d=2, only two cells per side, so after two cells, it turns.

But (2,0,-2) is the end of first side.

Then it turns to the next direction.

What is the next direction? In d=1, after moving east to (1,0,-1), then it moved to (1,-1,0) by add (0,-1,1)

Similarly here, from (2,0,-2), it moves to (2,-1,-1) by add (0,-1,1)? (2-2,-1-0,-1-(-2))? From (2,0,-2) to (2,-1,-1): add (0,-1,1)

Yes.

So direction (0,-1,1)

Then to next cell: for d=2, only one more cell? Since two cells per side, but the side starts at (2,0,-2)? Or at (1,1,-2)?

The second side starts at (2,0,-2), and moves to (2,-1,-1) by add (0,-1,1), so if d=2, it should have two cells: (2,0,-2) and (2,-1,-1)? But (2,-1,-1) is one cell, so the side has cells: first cell (2,0,-2), second cell (2,-1,-1)

Then next direction.

After (2,-1,-1), it should turn and move to next.

In d=1, after (1,-1,0), it moved to (0,-1,1) by add (-1,0,1)

Similarly, here from (2,-1,-1), add (-1,0,1) to (1,-1,0)

But (1,-1,0) is occupied (cell 3), so cannot. Instead, it moves to (2,-2,0) or to (1,-2,1)

Earlier we went to (2,-2,0) by add (0,-1,1) again? But that would be same direction.

From (2,-1,-1) to (2,-2,0): add (0,-1,1), same as before, but that would be continuing the same direction, but for d=2, after two cells, it should turn.

In our earlier manual list, we had 11 at (2,-2,0), but then 12 at (1,-2,1), which is add (-1,0,1)? From (2,-2,0) to (1,-2,1): add (-1,0,1)

Yes.

So for the second side, it has cells: (2,0,-2) and (2,-1,-1)? But (2,-1,-1) is at (2,-1,-1), then next is (2,-2,0), so if the side includes three cells? But d=2, should be two.

Perhaps the side starts after the turn.

For each side, the first cell is at the corner, and it moves d-1 steps to place d cells.

For first side of ring d: starts at S_d = (1,d-1,-d)

Then moves in dir V1 = (1,-1,0) for k=1 to d-1, to S_d + k*(1,-1,0)

For k=1: S_d + (1,-1,0) = (2,d-2,-d)

For k=2: (3,d-3,-d), etc.

For d=2: S2 = (1,1,-2)

Move for k=1: to (1+1,1-1,-2+0) = (2,0,-2) — cell 9

Then no more, since d-1=1 move.

So cells for first side: (1,1,-2) and (2,0,-2) — cells 8 and 9.

Then it turns to next direction.

The next direction: in the sequence, from the end of first side, which is (2,0,-2) for d=2, it moves to the first cell of next side.

In d=1, after first side (only one cell? For d=1, each "side" has one cell, since d=1.

After (1,0,-1), it moved to (1,-1,0) by add (0,-1,1)

So dir V2 = (0,-1,1)

Similarly here, from (2,0,-2) add (0,-1,1) to (2,-1,-1) — cell 10

Then for the second side, it starts at (2,-1,-1)? And moves in dir V2 = (0,-1,1) for k=1 to d-1.

For d=2, k=1: to (2,-1-1,-1+1) = (2,-2,0) — cell 11

So cells for second side: (2,-1,-1) and (2,-2,0) — cells 10 and 11.

Then next turn.

From (2,-2,0), in d=1, from (1,-1,0) it moved to (0,-1,1) by add (-1,0,1)

So V3 = (-1,0,1)

Here, add (-1,0,1) to (2-1,-2+0,0+1) = (1,-2,1) — cell 12

Then for third side, starts at (1,-2,1), move in dir V3 = (-1,0,1) for k=1 to d-1=1: to (1-1,-2+0,1+1) = (0,-2,2) — cell 13

So cells: (1,-2,1) and (0,-2,2) — 12 and 13.

Then next direction: in d=1, from (0,-1,1) to (-1,0,1) by add (-1,1,0)? From (0,-1,1) to (-1,0,1): add (-1,1,0)

So V4 = (-1,1,0)

Here, from (0,-2,2) add (-1,1,0) to (-1,-1,2) — cell 14? Earlier we assumed.

Then move for k=1: to (-1-1,-1+1,2+0) = (-2,0,2) — cell 15

Cells: (0,-2,2) and (-1,-1,2)? But (-1,-1,2) and (-2,0,2)

14 and 15.

Then next: from (-2,0,2), in d=1, from (-1,0,1) to (-1,1,0) by add (0,1,-1)

So V5 = (0,1,-1)

Add to (-2,0,2) + (0,1,-1) = (-2,1,1) — cell 16

Then move for k=1: to (-2,1+1,1-1) = (-2,2,0) — cell 17

Cells: (-2,0,2) and (-2,1,1)? But (-2,1,1) and (-2,2,0) — 15? 15 is (-2,0,2), 16 is (-2,1,1)? Earlier I said 16 at (-2,1,1), 17 at (-2,2,0)

But in sequence, after 15 at (-2,0,2), then 16 at (-2,1,1), then 17 at (-2,2,0)? But for d=2, each side should have two cells, but here from (-2,0,2) to (-2,1,1) is one move, but then to (-2,2,0) is another, so three cells? Inconsistency.

After moving to (-2,1,1), then for the side, it should be only up to there? But then next cell is 17 at (-2,2,0), which is adjacent.

In the move, after adding V5 = (0,1,-1) to (-2,0,2) to get (-2,1,1), then for the fifth side, cells are (-2,0,2) and (-2,1,1)? But (-2,0,2) is already the start? Confusion.

The side starts at the cell after turn.

After turning, the first cell of the side is the one we move to.

In this case, after fourth side ends at (-2,0,2)? The end of fourth side is (-2,0,2) for cell 15.

Then we move to the first cell of fifth side: add V5 = (0,1,-1) to (-2,0,2) to get (-2,1,1) — cell 16, which is the first cell of fifth side.

Then we move in dir V5 = (0,1,-1) for k=1 to d-1=1: to (-2,1+1,1-1) = (-2,2,0) — cell 17.

So cells for fifth side: (-2,1,1) and (-2,2,0) — 16 and 17.

Then next turn: from (-2,2,0), add next direction V6.

In d=1, from (-1,1,0) to (0,1,-1) by add (1,0,-1)

So V6 = (1,0,-1)

Add to (-2,2,0) + (1,0,-1) = (-1,2,-1) — cell 18

Then move for k=1: to (-1+1,2+0,-1-1) = (0,2,-2) — cell 19

Cells: (-1,2,-1) and (0,2,-2) — 18 and 19.

Then end.

So for each side, there are d cells: the first is placed after turning, and then we move d-1 steps in the direction to place the remaining d-1 cells.

Total cells per side: d.

Now, the directions are fixed: V1 = (1,-1,0), V2 = (0,-1,1), V3 = (-1,0,1), V4 = (-1,1,0), V5 = (0,1,-1), V6 = (1,0,-1)

And the starting point for each side:

- Side 1: starts at S_d = (1, d-1, -d)

- After side 1, we are at S_d + (d-1)*V1 = (1, d-1, -d) + (d-1)(1,-1,0) = (1 + d -1, d-1 - (d-1), -d) = (d, 0, -d)

- Then we add V2 to get start of side 2: (d,0,-d) + (0,-1,1) = (d, -1, -d+1)

- Then after side 2, at (d,-1,-d+1) + (d-1)*V2 = (d,-1,-d+1) + (d-1)(0,-1,1) = (d, -1 -d +1, -d+1 + d -1) = (d, -d, 0)

- Add V3 to start side 3: (d,-d,0) + (-1,0,1) = (d-1, -d, 1)

- After side 3: (d-1,-d,1) + (d-1)V3 = (d-1,-d,1) + (d-1)(-1,0,1) = (d-1 -d +1, -d, 1 + d -1) = (0, -d, d)

- Add V4 to start side 4: (0,-d,d) + (-1,1,0) = (-1, -d+1, d)

- After side 4: (-1,-d+1,d) + (d-1)V4 = (-1,-d+1,d) + (d-1)(-1,1,0) = (-1 -d +1, -d+1 + d -1, d) = (-d, 0, d)

- Add V5 to start side 5: (-d,0,d) + (0,1,-1) = (-d,1,d-1)

- After side 5: (-d,1,d-1) + (d-1)V5 = (-d,1,d-1) + (d-1)(0,1,-1) = (-d, 1 + d -1, d-1 -d +1) = (-d, d, 0)

- Add V6 to start side 6: (-d,d,0) + (1,0,-1) = (-d+1, d, -1)

- After side 6: (-d+1,d,-1) + (d-1)V6 = (-d+1,d,-1) + (d-1)(1,0,-1) = (-d+1 + d -1, d, -1 -d +1) = (0,d,-d)

Now, the end of ring d is at (0,d,-d)

And to start ring d+1, we add V6 again? V6 is (1,0,-1), but from (0,d,-d) add (1,0,-1) = (1,d,-d-1)

But earlier for ring d+1, start is (1,d,-d-1)? For example d=1: (1,1,-2)? But ring d=2 starts at (1,1,-2), which is (1,d,-d-1) for d=2? (1,2,-3)? But earlier we had (1,1,-2) for d=2, inconsistency.

For ring d+1, start should be (1,d, -d-1)? For d+1=2, d=1, (1,1,-2) yes.

In general, ring k starts at (1,k-1,-k)

After ring d ends at (0,d,-d), then add V6 = (1,0,-1) to get (1,d,-d-1) = (1,d,-(d+1)) , which is exactly the start of ring d+1: (1,(d+1)-1, -(d+1)) = (1,d,-d-1) yes.

Perfect.

So now we have the setup.

For ring d, it has 6 sides, each with d cells.

The sides are traversed in order: side 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Each side has d cells, indexed from 0 to d-1 or 1 to d, but in terms of position.

The cell position in the ring: total cells 6d.

The index k from 0 to 6d-1, or 1 to 6d.

Earlier for our case, k=75 in ring d=26.

k is the position in the ring, starting from 0 or 1.

In our calculation, for ring d, first cell is at index 1? Earlier for ring d=26, first cell is 1952, which is k=1.

So k=1 to 156 for d=26.

k=75.

Now, each side has d cells.

So the side number s and the index within side i.

s = floor((k-1)/d) + 1 ? Let's see.

k from 1 to d: side 1

k=d+1 to 2d: side 2

etc.

For k=1: side 1, first cell

k=d: side 1, last cell

k=d+1: side 2, first cell

etc.

So side s = ceil(k / d) ? For k=1, s=1

k=d, s=1

k=d+1, s=2

So s = floor((k-1)/d) + 1

Then within side, index i = (k-1) mod d + 1 ? i from 1 to d.

For k=1: i=1

k=d: i=d

k=d+1: i=1

Yes.

Since each side has d cells, the offset in side is (k-1) mod d, from 0 to d-1.

Then the cell coordinates depend on s and i.

For each side, the starting point and direction.

From earlier:

Side 1: starts at P1 = (1, d-1, -d)

Direction V1 = (1,-1,0)

Then the i-th cell in side 1: P1 + (i-1) * V1

Since i=1: P1, i=2: P1 + V1, etc.

Similarly for other sides.

We have the starting points for each side:

As computed earlier:

After side s-1, we have the end point, but we have expressions.

From earlier computation:

- Side 1 start: (1, d-1, -d)

- Side 2 start: (d, -1, -d+1)  [after adding V2 to end of side1]

- Side 3 start: (d-1, -d, 1)

- Side 4 start: (-1, -d+1, d)

- Side 5 start: (-d, 1, d-1)

- Side 6 start: (-d+1, d, -1)

And directions:

V1: (1,-1,0)

V2: (0,-1,1)

V3: (-1,0,1)

V4: (-1,1,0)

V5: (0,1,-1)

V6: (1,0,-1)

Now for a given s and i, the cell is start_s + (i-1) * V_s

Then coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0.

Now for our case, d=26, k=75.

First, find side s.

d=26, so cells per side =26.

k=75.

s = floor((k-1)/d) + 1 = floor(74 / 26) + 1

74 / 26 = 2.846..., floor=2, so s=2+1=3? floor(74/26)=2, since 26*2=52<74, 26*3=78>74.

So s=2+1=3? floor((k-1)/d) +1 = floor(74/26) +1 = 2 +1 =3.

But let's check: k=1 to 26: side1

k=27 to 52: side2

k=53 to 78: side3? 26*2=52, so k=53 to 78 is side3? But d=26, each side 26 cells, so side1:1-26, side2:27-52, side3:53-78, side4:79-104, etc.

k=75 is in 53-78, so side s=3.

Then within side, i = (k-1) mod d +1 = 74 mod 26 +1

74 divided by 26: 26*2=52, 74-52=22, so mod 26 is 22? 74 - 52=22, yes.

So i = 22 +1 =23? i = (k-1) mod d +1 = 22 +1=23.

Since i from 1 to d, so i=23.

k=75, first of side is k=53, so offset =75-53=22? Since k=53 is i=1, k=54 i=2, ..., k=75 is i=75-52=23? k=53: i=1, k=54:i=2, ..., k=75: 75-52=23? 75-53+1=23, yes i=23.

Offset from start: i-1=22.

So for side s=3, i=23.

Now side 3 start: as above, (d-1, -d, 1) = (26-1, -26, 1) = (25, -26, 1)

Direction V3 = (-1,0,1)

So cell position: start + (i-1) * V3 = (25,-26,1) + 22 * (-1,0,1) = (25,-26,1) + (-22,0,22) = (25-22, -26+0, 1+22) = (3,-26,23)

Check sum: 3 + (-26) + 23 = 3-26+23=26-26=0, good.

Distance: |3|+|-26|+|23|=3+26+23=52, /2=26, good.

So cell 2026 is at (3,-26,23)

Now we need its six neighbors.

In cube coordinates, neighbors are obtained by adding the six direction vectors:

(1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1)

So the neighbor positions:

1. (3+1,-26+0,23-1) = (4,-26,22)

2. (3+1,-26-1,23+0) = (4,-27,23)

3. (3+0,-26-1,23+1) = (3,-27,24)

4. (3-1,-26+0,23+1) = (2,-26,24)

5. (3-1,-26+1,23+0) = (2,-25,23)

6. (3+0,-26+1,23-1) = (3,-25,22)

Each neighbor must satisfy x+y+z=0, which they do, since we added vectors that preserve sum 0.

Now, these are the coordinates of the neighbors.

But we need the numbers at these positions, but only if they exist; since the grid is infinite, and spiral covers all, but we need to find which numbers are there.

To find the number at a given coordinate, we need to find which ring it's in and its position.

Since we need the sum of neighbors, and neighbors might be in different rings, but we can compute for each neighbor its distance from center, and then its position in its ring.

Each neighbor is at distance d_neighbor from center.

The distance is (|x|+|y|+|z|)/2.

For each neighbor:

1. (4,-26,22): |4|+|-26|+|22|=4+26+22=52, /2=26

2. (4,-27,23): |4|+|-27|+|23|=4+27+23=54,/2=27

3. (3,-27,24): |3|+|-27|+|24|=3+27+24=54,/2=27

4. (2,-26,24): |2|+|-26|+|24|=2+26+24=52,/2=26

5. (2,-25,23): |2|+|-25|+|23|=2+25+23=50,/2=25

6. (3,-25,22): |3|+|-25|+|22|=3+25+22=50,/2=25

So neighbors 1 and 4 are at distance 26, same as 2026.

Neighbors 2 and 3 at distance 27.

Neighbors 5 and 6 at distance 25.

Now, since the spiral fills rings in order, and rings are filled sequentially, we can find the number for each neighbor by finding its position in its ring.

First, for neighbors at distance 25: neighbor 5: (2,-25,23), neighbor 6: (3,-25,22)

Since symmetric, probably same ring, but different positions.

Distance 25, ring d=25.

Total cells up to distance 24: 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600 = 1+1800=1801? Earlier formula: total up to d is 1 + 3d(d+1)

d=24: 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600=1801

d=25: 1 + 3*25*26=1+3*650=1+1950=1951, as before.

So ring d=25 has cells from 1802 to 1951, total 6*25=150 cells.

Now, for neighbor 5: (2,-25,23)

We need to find which side and index in ring d=25.

Similarly for neighbor 6: (3,-25,22)

Now, we can compute its position using the same spiral mapping.

For a given coordinate, we can determine which side it's on and its offset.

Since we know the starting points and directions, we can compute for each point.

First, for neighbor 5: (2,-25,23) at d=25.

Now, we need to see which side it belongs to.

The sides are defined by the direction.

We can compute the vector from the center, but perhaps check against the side definitions.

Note that for each side, the coordinates satisfy certain relations.

Since the spiral is systematic, we can compute the "angle" or the direction.

A better way: for a given point (x,y,z) at distance d, we can determine the side by seeing which direction it is closest to, but since it's discrete, we can compute the offset.

Recall that for side s, the start point and direction.

For ring d=25:

Side 1 start: (1,24,-25)  [since (1,d-1,-d)=(1,24,-25)]

Dir V1=(1,-1,0)

Side 2 start: (25,-1,-24)  [ (d,-1,-d+1)=(25,-1,-24) ]

Side 3 start: (24,-25,1)  [ (d-1,-d,1)=(24,-25,1) ]

Side 4 start: (-1,-24,25)  [ (-1,-d+1,d)=(-1,-24,25) ]

Side 5 start: (-25,1,24)  [ (-d,1,d-1)=(-25,1,24) ]

Side 6 start: (-24,25,-1)  [ (-d+1,d,-1)=(-24,25,-1) ]

Now, for a point, we can see which side it is on by seeing which start point it aligns with in direction.

Specifically, for a cell on side s, it should be that the vector from start_s to the cell is parallel to V_s, and within range.

Since each side is a straight line in the direction V_s.

So for a point P, and a side start S_s, if P - S_s is parallel to V_s, and the scalar multiple is between 0 and d-1.

Since V_s has coprime components, the multiple must be integer, say t, and 0 <= t <= d-1.

Then i = t + 1.

Now, for neighbor 5: P = (2,-25,23)

d=25.

Check side 1: S1=(1,24,-25)

P - S1 = (2-1, -25-24, 23-(-25)) = (1,-49,48)

Is this parallel to V1=(1,-1,0)? That is, is (1,-49,48) = t * (1,-1,0) for some t? But (1,-1,0) has z-component 0, but here z=48, not zero, so no.

Side 2: S2=(25,-1,-24)

P - S2 = (2-25, -25-(-1), 23-(-24)) = (-23,-24,47)

V2=(0,-1,1)

Is (-23,-24,47) parallel to (0,-1,1)? Suppose t*(0,-1,1)= (0,-t,t)

Set equal: -23=0? No, contradiction.

Side 3: S3=(24,-25,1)

P - S3 = (2-24, -25-(-25), 23-1) = (-22,0,22)

V3=(-1,0,1)

Is (-22,0,22) parallel to (-1,0,1)? Yes, since (-22,0,22) = 22 * (-1,0,1)? 22*(-1,0,1)=(-22,0,22), yes.

t=22.

Now t between 0 and d-1=24? 0<=22<=24, yes.

So i = t + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23? Since t is the multiplier, and i-th cell: for i=1, t=0; i=2,t=1; ... so i = t + 1.

Here t=22, so i=23.

Now, is this within the side? Side 3 has cells from i=1 to 25, i=23 is fine.

So for side s=3, i=23.

Now, the position in the ring: side 1: cells 1-25, side 2:26-50, side 3:51-75, ..., since each side d=25 cells.

Side s=3: k from (s-1)*d +1 to s*d = 2*25 +1=51 to 3*25=75.

So k=51 to 75.

i=23, so k = (s-1)*d + i = 2*25 + 23 = 50 + 23 = 73? Since s=3, offset (s-1)*d = 50, then plus i=23, so k=73? But i=1 is first cell, k=51, so k = 50 + i? i=1,k=51; i=2,k=52; ... i=23,k=51+22=73? Since i=1: k=51, so k = 50 + i? 50+1=51, yes; 50+23=73.

So position k=73 in ring d=25.

Total cells up to d=24: 1 + 3*24*25 =1+1800=1801? Earlier I said 1801, but confirm: total up to d=24: 1 + 3*24*25 =1+3*600=1801, yes.

Ring d=25: cells from 1802 to 1801 + 150 = 1951.

First cell: 1802

So k=1: 1802

k=2:1803

...

k=73: 1802 + 72 = 1874? Since k=1:1802, k=73:1802 + 72 = 1874.

1802 + 72 = 1874, yes.

So number at (2,-25,23) is 1874.

Now, neighbor 6: (3,-25,22)

Same distance d=25.

Check sides.

Side 1: S1=(1,24,-25)

P - S1 = (3-1,-25-24,22-(-25)) = (2,-49,47) not parallel to (1,-1,0)

Side 2: S2=(25,-1,-24)

P - S2 = (3-25,-25-(-1),22-(-24)) = (-22,-24,46) not parallel to (0,-1,1)

Side 3: S3=(24,-25,1)

P - S3 = (3-24,-25-(-25),22-1) = (-21,0,21) parallel to V3=(-1,0,1)? (-21,0,21) = 21 * (-1,0,1), yes.

t=21, i=t+1=22

Side s=3, i=22

Then k= (s-1)*d + i = 2*25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72

So k=72 in ring d=25.

Number: 1802 + 71 = 1873? k=1:1802, k=72:1802 + 71=1873.

1802 + 71 = 1873.

Now, neighbors at distance 26: same ring as 2026.

Neighbor 1: (4,-26,22)

d=26.

Ring d=26, total cells 6*26=156, from 1952 to 2107.

We need to find its position in ring.

P=(4,-26,22)

Side s?

Check against starts.

Side 1: S1=(1,25,-26) [d=26, (1,25,-26)]

P - S1 = (4-1,-26-25,22-(-26)) = (3,-51,48) not parallel to (1,-1,0)

Side 2: S2=(26,-1,-25) [ (26,-1,-25) ]

P - S2 = (4-26,-26-(-1),22-(-25)) = (-22,-25,47) not parallel to (0,-1,1)

Side 3: S3=(25,-26,1) [ (25,-26,1) ]

P - S3 = (4-25,-26-(-26),22-1) = (-21,0,21) parallel to V3=(-1,0,1)? (-21,0,21) = 21 * (-1,0,1), yes.

t=21, i=t+1=22

Side s=3, same as 2026.

2026 is also in side 3, i=23.

Here i=22.

So k in ring: s=3, i=22

k= (s-1)*d + i = 2*26 + 22 = 52 + 22 = 74

Ring starts at k=1:1952

So number: 1952 + 73 = 2025? k=1:1952, k=74:1952 + 73 = 2025.

1952 + 73 = 2025, yes.

Now neighbor 4: (2,-26,24)

d=26.

P=(2,-26,24)

Check sides.

Side 1: S1=(1,25,-26)

P - S1 = (2-1,-26-25,24-(-26)) = (1,-51,50) not parallel to (1,-1,0)? (1,-51,50) vs (1,-1,0), not parallel.

Side 2: S2=(26,-1,-25)

P - S2 = (2-26,-26-(-1),24-(-25)) = (-24,-25,49) not parallel to (0,-1,1)

Side 3: S3=(25,-26,1)

P - S3 = (2-25,-26-(-26),24-1) = (-23,0,23) parallel to V3=(-1,0,1)? (-23,0,23) = 23 * (-1,0,1), yes.

t=23, i=t+1=24

Side s=3, i=24

k= (s-1)*d + i = 2*26 + 24 = 52 + 24 = 76

Number: 1952 + 75 = 2027? k=1:1952, k=76:1952 + 75 = 2027.

1952 + 75 = 2027.

Now neighbors at distance 27: ring d=27.

Total cells up to d=26: 1 + 3*26*27 =1+3*702=1+2106=2107

Ring d=27: cells from 2108 to 2107 + 6*27=2107+162=2269

Number of cells: 6*27=162.

Neighbor 2: (4,-27,23)

d=27.

P=(4,-27,23)

Find side and i.

Side 1: S1=(1,26,-27)

P - S1 = (4-1,-27-26,23-(-27)) = (3,-53,50) not parallel to (1,-1,0)

Side 2: S2=(27,-1,-26)

P - S2 = (4-27,-27-(-1),23-(-26)) = (-23,-26,49) not parallel to (0,-1,1)

Side 3: S3=(26,-27,1)

P - S3 = (4-26,-27-(-27),23-1) = (-22,0,22) parallel to V3=(-1,0,1)? (-22,0,22)=22*(-1,0,1), yes.

t=22, i=23

Side s=3

k= (s-1)*d + i = 2*27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77

First cell of ring: 2108

So number: 2108 + 76 = 2184? k=1:2108, k=77:2108 + 76 = 2184.

2108 + 76 = 2184.

Now neighbor 3: (3,-27,24)

d=27.

P=(3,-27,24)

Side 1: S1=(1,26,-27)

P - S1 = (3-1,-27-26,24-(-27)) = (2,-53,51) not parallel

Side 2: S2=(27,-1,-26)

P - S2 = (3-27,-27-(-1),24-(-26)) = (-24,-26,50) not parallel

Side 3: S3=(26,-27,1)

P - S3 = (3-26,-27-(-27),24-1) = (-23,0,23) parallel to V3? (-23,0,23)=23*(-1,0,1), yes.

t=23, i=24

Side s=3

k= (s-1)*d + i = 2*27 + 24 = 54 + 24 = 78

Number: 2108 + 77 = 2185? k=1:2108, k=78:2108 + 77 = 2185.

Now, summarize the neighbors' numbers:

- Neighbor 1 (dist 26): 2025

- Neighbor 2 (dist 27): 2184

- Neighbor 3 (dist 27): 2185

- Neighbor 4 (dist 26): 2027

- Neighbor 5 (dist 25): 1874

- Neighbor 6 (dist 25): 1873

Now sum: 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185

Note that 2025 and 2027 are symmetric around 2026.

Similarly, 1873 and 1874 are consecutive? 1873 and 1874.

2184 and 2185 consecutive.

But anyway, compute step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now sum these: 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Compute:

4052 + 3747: 4000+3700=7700, 52+47=99, total 7799.

7799 + 4369: 7799 + 4000 = 11799, +369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, +69 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a small number.

For example, take number 1, neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

Now compute with our method.

Cell 1 at (0,0,0)

Neighbors:

1. (1,0,-1) - number? Earlier 2

2. (1,-1,0) - 3

3. (0,-1,1) - 4

4. (-1,0,1) - 5

5. (-1,1,0) - 6

6. (0,1,-1) - 7

All at distance 1.

Now, for neighbor 1: (1,0,-1), d=1.

Ring d=1.

Side? S1=(1,0,-1) for d=1.

P - S1 = (0,0,0)? P is (1,0,-1), S1=(1,0,-1), so difference (0,0,0), which is parallel to V1=(1,-1,0)? Well, (0,0,0) = 0 * V1, so t=0, i=1.

Side s=1.

k= (s-1)*d + i =0*1 +1=1

Total up to d=0:1? d=0 is center, total cells within d=0 is 1 (center).

Ring d=1: cells from 2 to 7? Total up to d=0 is 1, so ring d=1:2 to 7.

k=1: first cell, should be 2? But we have neighbor 1 is at (1,0,-1), which is cell 2, yes.

Similarly, neighbor 2: (1,-1,0)

d=1.

S1=(1,0,-1)

P - S1 = (0,-1,1) not parallel to (1,-1,0)? (0,-1,1) vs (1,-1,0), not parallel.

Side 2: S2=(1,-1,0)? For d=1, S2=(d,-1,-d+1)=(1,-1,0)

P - S2 = (1-1,-1-(-1),0-0)=(0,0,0), so t=0, i=1.

Side s=2.

k= (s-1)*d + i =1*1 +1=2? But ring d=1, k=1:2, k=2:3? But (1,-1,0) is cell 3, yes.

Similarly, neighbor 3: (0,-1,1)

S3=(d-1,-d,1)=(0,-1,1) for d=1? (1-1,-1,1)=(0,-1,1)

P - S3 = (0-0,-1-(-1),1-1)=(0,0,0), t=0,i=1,s=3,k=2*1 +1? (s-1)d + i = (3-1)*1 +1=2+1=3? But should be cell 4? Inconsistency.

k= (s-1)*d + i

s=3, d=1, i=1, k=(3-1)*1 +1=2+1=3

But cell at (0,-1,1) is number 4? Earlier: 1:(0,0,0), 2:(1,0,-1), 3:(1,-1,0), 4:(0,-1,1), so yes, number 4, but k=3? Ring d=1: k=1:2, k=2:3, k=3:4, yes.

Similarly, neighbor 4: (-1,0,1), S4=(-1,-d+1,d)=(-1,0,1) for d=1? (-1,-1+1,1)=(-1,0,1), yes. P-S4=(0,0,0), t=0,i=1,s=4,k=(4-1)*1 +1=3+1=4? But k=4: should be 5? Sequence: k=1:2, k=2:3, k=3:4, k=4:5, and (-1,0,1) is cell 5, yes.

Neighbor 5: (-1,1,0), S5=(-d,1,d-1)=(-1,1,0) for d=1. P-S5=(0,0,0), t=0,i=1,s=5,k=(5-1)*1 +1=4+1=5? k=5:6? But (-1,1,0) is cell 6, yes.

Neighbor 6: (0,1,-1), S6=(-d+1,d,-1)=(0,1,-1) for d=1. P-S6=(0,0,0), t=0,i=1,s=6,k=(6-1)*1 +1=5+1=6? k=6:7? But (0,1,-1) is cell 7, yes.

So numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 27, correct.

Now in our case, we have neighbors: 2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874, 1873

Sum: 2025+2027=4052, 1873+1874=3747, 2184+2185=4369

Then 4052+3747=7799, 7799+4369=12168

But let me confirm the values.

For neighbor 5: (2,-25,23), we got 1874

Ring d=25, k=73, first cell 1802, so 1802 + 72 = 1874? k=1:1802, k=73:1802 + 72 = 1874, yes.

Similarly, neighbor 6: (3,-25,22), k=72, 1802 + 71 = 1873, yes.

Neighbor 1: (4,-26,22), ring d=26, k=74, first 1952, 1952 + 73 = 2025? 1952 + 73 = 2025, yes.

Neighbor 4: (2,-26,24), k=76, 1952 + 75 = 2027? 1952 + 75 = 2027, yes.

Neighbor 2: (4,-27,23), ring d=27, k=77, first 2108, 2108 + 76 = 2184? 2108 + 76 = 2184, yes.

Neighbor 3: (3,-27,24), k=78, 2108 + 77 = 2185, yes.

Now sum: 1873 + 1874 = 3747

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

3747 + 4052: 3700+4000=7700, 47+52=99, total 7799.

7799 + 4369: 7799 + 4000 = 11799, 11799 + 369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, 12099 + 69 = 12168.

So the sum is 12168.

But the problem asks for the sum of all six neighbors, and we have them.

Notice that for neighbors in the same ring, they are consecutive: 2025 and 2027 are not consecutive to 2026, but 2025 is before, 2027 after.

Similarly, the others are consecutive pairs: 1873-1874, 2184-2185.

But anyway, sum is correct.

So answer should be 12168.

But let me see if there is any mistake.

For neighbor 3: (3,-27,24), we have s=3, i=24, d=27, k=78.

But ring d=27 has 162 cells, k=78 is within 1 to 162.

First cell: total up to d=26 is 2107, so first of ring is 2108.

k=78: 2108 + 77 = 2185, since k=1:2108, k=78:2108 + 77 = 2185, yes.

Similarly others.

Another way: since the neighbors include two from inner ring (d=25), two from same ring (d=26), two from outer ring (d=27).

The inner neighbors: 1873 and 1874, sum 1873+1874=3747

Same ring: 2025 and 2027, sum 4052

Outer: 2184 and 2185, sum 4369

Total sum 3747+4052+4369=12168

Note that 1873+1874=3747, which is 2*1873.5, but anyway.

I think it's correct.

So the sum is 12168.

The number 2026 is located at position (3, -26, 23) in the hexagonal grid's cube coordinate system, where the sum of the coordinates is zero. The six neighboring positions are obtained by adding the direction vectors for a hexagonal grid to this position:

- (3, -26, 23) + (1, 0, -1) = (4, -26, 22)
- (3, -26, 23) + (1, -1, 0) = (4, -27, 23)
- (3, -26, 23) + (0, -1, 1) = (3, -27, 24)
- (3, -26, 23) + (-1, 0, 1) = (2, -26, 24)
- (3, -26, 23) + (-1, 1, 0) = (2, -25, 23)
- (3, -26, 23) + (0, 1, -1) = (3, -25, 22)

The distances from the center (0, 0, 0) to these neighbors are calculated as half the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates:
- (4, -26, 22): |4| + |-26| + |22| = 52, distance = 52 / 2 = 26
- (4, -27, 23): |4| + |-27| + |23| = 54, distance = 54 / 2 = 27
- (3, -27, 24): |3| + |-27| + |24| = 54, distance = 54 / 2 = 27
- (2, -26, 24): |2| + |-26| + |24| = 52, distance = 52 / 2 = 26
- (2, -25, 23): |2| + |-25| + |23| = 50, distance = 50 / 2 = 25
- (3, -25, 22): |3| + |-25| + |22| = 50, distance = 50 / 2 = 25

The numbers at these positions are found by determining their positions in their respective rings:
- At distance 25 (ring d=25):
  - (2, -25, 23): position k=73 in ring, number = 1874
  - (3, -25, 22): position k=72 in ring, number = 1873
- At distance 26 (ring d=26, same as 2026):
  - (4, -26, 22): position k=74 in ring, number = 2025
  - (2, -26, 24): position k=76 in ring, number = 2027
- At distance 27 (ring d=27):
  - (4, -27, 23): position k=77 in ring, number = 2184
  - (3, -27, 24): position k=78 in ring, number = 2185

The sum of the neighbors is:
1874 + 1873 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168

\boxed{12168}
