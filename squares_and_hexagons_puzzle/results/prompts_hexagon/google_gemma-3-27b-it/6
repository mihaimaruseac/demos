Let the hexagonal grid be arranged such that the center is 1, and the numbers spiral around it.
We can imagine the hexagonal grid as layers. The first layer consists of 1. The second layer consists of 6 numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The third layer consists of 12 numbers, and so on. The $n$-th layer consists of $6(n-1)$ numbers.
The number of numbers in the first $n$ layers is $1 + 6 + 12 + \dots + 6(n-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 1 + 6 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 - 3n + 1 \geq 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n + 1 - 2026 \geq 0$
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \geq 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \geq 0$
Using the quadratic formula, we have $n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
We want the positive root, so $n = \frac{1+51.97}{2} = \frac{52.97}{2} \approx 26.485$. Since $n$ must be an integer, we take $n = 27$.
The number of numbers in the first 26 layers is $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
The number of numbers in the first 27 layers is $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Therefore, 2026 is in the 27-th layer. Let $x = 2026$. We want to find the 6 neighbors of $x$ and their sum.
The numbers in the $n$-th layer are greater than the numbers in the $(n-1)$-th layer.
In the 27-th layer, the number of terms is $6(27-1) = 6(26) = 156$.
The numbers in the 26-th layer are from 1951 to 2026.
We want to find the position of 2026 in the 27-th layer. Since we know there are 1951 numbers in the first 26 layers, 2026 is the $2026 - 1951 = 75$-th number in the 27-th layer.
In the 27-th layer, the numbers are arranged around the previous layer. The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers around 2026 in the hexagonal grid.
The neighbors are $2026-1, 2026-2, \dots, 2026+6, \dots$
The sum of the neighbors is $2026-15+2026-14+2026-13+2026-12+2026-11+2026-10 = 6(2026) - (15+14+13+12+11+10) = 12156 - 75 = 12081$.
Let's consider a simpler case. The number 1 in the middle has 6 neighbors.
Suppose the number 2 is added to the grid. Then the neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The sum is 27.
For the hexagon grid, the six neighbors of a number are the numbers that are 1 step away. These are close.
The sum of the 6 neighbors of $n$ is approximately $6n$.
The six neighbors of 2026 will have an average value of about 2026, so the sum will be around $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.
Since 2026 is in the 27th layer, the neighbors must be in the 27th layer.
The 6 neighbors of 2026 are those values that are one step away.
Sum of the six neighbors of 2026 will be 12156 - [something].
Let $n$ be the number in the hexagon grid. The six neighbors of $n$ are $n-1, n-2, \dots, n+5$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
