Let the numbers be written on a hexagonal grid. The numbers are arranged in a spiral.
The numbers are written as:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
Let us find the general pattern of the arrangement. The center number is 1. The spiral goes outwards in layers.
The numbers are arranged in hexagonal layers around the center number 1.
The first layer consists of numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
The second layer consists of numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...
We want to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
Let's assume that the center number is $a_{0,0} = 1$. Then the coordinates $(x,y)$ can be used to represent the position of the numbers on the grid.
Let's examine the first few numbers:
1 is at (0,0).
2 is at (1,0); 3 is at (1,1); 4 is at (0,1); 5 is at (-1,1); 6 is at (-1,0); 7 is at (-1,-1); 8 is at (0,-1); 9 is at (1,-1); 10 is at (2,0); 11 is at (2,1); 12 is at (1,2)
The number of numbers in the first layer is 6.
The number of numbers in the second layer is 12.
The number of numbers in the third layer is 18.
The $n$-th layer has $6n$ numbers.
The total number of numbers up to layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 6\sum_{k=1}^n k = 1 + 6 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3n^2 + 3n + 1 - 2026 \ge 0$
$3n^2 + 3n - 2025 \ge 0$
$n^2 + n - 675 \ge 0$
The roots of $n^2 + n - 675 = 0$ are $n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(-675)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{-1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
So $n \approx \frac{50.97}{2} \approx 25.48$. We take $n=25$.
The total number of numbers up to layer 25 is $3(25^2) + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
The total number of numbers up to layer 26 is $3(26^2) + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 < 2107$, 2026 is in layer 26.
The numbers in layer $n$ are $1951 + k$ where $k$ from 1 to $6n$.
$2026 = 1951 + k$, so $k = 2026 - 1951 = 75$.
Since $6(26)=156$, $75 < 156$, so 2026 is in layer 26.
The sum of the neighbors of a number $x$ is $x-1 + x+1 + x-1-a + x+1-b + x-c + x+c$, where $a, b, c$ are odd integers representing the difference between the hexagon vertices.
The sum of the six neighbors of a number $n$ is $6n$.
Alternatively, we can notice that the sum of the six neighbors around a number is equal to $6n$.
Then the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026) = 12156$. However, we must consider the hexagonal grid.
Let $N$ be the number. The six neighbors are $N-1$, $N+1$, $N-1-k$, $N+1-k$, $N-k$, $N+k$ for some value $k$.
The sum of the six neighbors is $6N$.
So, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
