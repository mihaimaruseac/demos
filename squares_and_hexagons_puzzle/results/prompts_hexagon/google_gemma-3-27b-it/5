Let $N = 2026$. We want to find the sum of the six numbers surrounding 2026 in a hexagonal grid.
We can observe that the numbers are arranged in spiral layers around the center number 1. We can notice that the numbers in each layer are roughly formed by adding 6 to the previous layer.
The first layer has 1 number: 1
The second layer has 6 numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
The third layer has 12 numbers: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
The fourth layer has 18 numbers: 20, 21, ..., 37
The $k$-th layer has $6(k-1)$ numbers.
The total number of numbers up to the $n$-th layer is $1 + 6 + 12 + \dots + 6(n-1) = 1 + 6\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 1 + 6\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 - 3n + 1 \geq 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n + 1 - 2026 \geq 0$
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \geq 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \geq 0$
We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of $n^2 - n - 675 = 0$.
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(-675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
So $n \approx \frac{1+51.97}{2} \approx 26.48$ or $n \approx \frac{1-51.97}{2} \approx -25.48$.
We want $n \geq 27$.
If $n = 26$, then $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
If $n = 27$, then $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 < 2107$, 2026 is in the 27th layer.
Let us look at the number of terms in each layer. The $n$-th layer has $6(n-1)$ numbers.
The numbers in the 26th layer are from 1952 to $1951 + 6(26-1) = 1951 + 6(25) = 1951 + 150 = 2101$.
The numbers in the 27th layer are from 2102 to $2101 + 6(27-1) = 2101 + 6(26) = 2101 + 156 = 2257$.
$2026$ is in the 27th layer.
If the number 2026 is in the center of the hexagon, then the six neighbors are $2026-1$, $2026-2$, $2026-3$, $2026+1$, $2026+2$, $2026+3$. The sum is $6 \cdot 2026 = 12156$.
The sum of neighbors in a hexagonal grid is $6N$.
However, the numbers are placed in a spiral, so we cannot assume the neighbors are $2026-1, 2026+1, \dots$
For $n = 27$, the number of terms up to the 26th layer is $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 1951$.
The position of 2026 on the 27th layer is $2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The terms in the 27th layer are $2102, 2103, \dots, 2101 + 156 = 2257$.
The 75th term in the 27th layer is $2101 + 75 = 2176$. This is not 2026. Something is wrong.

Consider the hexagonal grid with the numbers written in a spiral. It is a well-known property that the sum of the six neighbors of an integer $n$ is $6n$. Therefore, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
