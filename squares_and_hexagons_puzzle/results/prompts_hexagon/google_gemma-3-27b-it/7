Let the number at the center of the spiral be 1. The spiral increases by going to the next layer. The spiral can be represented by hexagonal coordinates. Let's analyze the relation between the number $n$ and its position in the spiral.
The numbers are arranged in layers around the central 1.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Layer 3: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
Let $L_k$ be the $k$-th layer. The number of terms in layer $k$ is $6(k-1)$ for $k > 1$.
The total number of terms up to layer $k$ is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^k 6(i-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = 1 + 6 \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 1 + 3(k-1)k = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$.
We want to find $k$ such that $3k^2 - 3k + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3k^2 - 3k + 1 - 2026 \ge 0$
$3k^2 - 3k - 2025 \ge 0$
$k^2 - k - 675 \ge 0$
$k = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(-675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$
So $k \approx \frac{1+51.97}{2} \approx 26.485$. Hence $k=27$.
Let's check: $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
$3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
So 2026 lies in layer 27. The number of terms in the layers 1 to 26 is 1951.
$2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The 75th term in layer 27 is 2026.
In a hexagonal grid, the six neighbors are:
$n-1, n-2, n-3, n+1, n+2, n+3$ where each neighbor is on the hexagonal grid.
When $n$ is in layer $k$, the numbers around $n$ are $n-1, n+1, n-2, n+2, n-3, n+3$.
The neighbors of 2026 are $2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029$. This is likely incorrect.
We want to find the neighbors of 2026. Since the numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid, we can use the following formula:
The neighbors of $n$ are $n+1, n+2, n+3, n-1, n-2, n-3$. But we need to make sure they are in the grid.
The closest numbers to 2026 are likely 2025, 2027, 2020, 2030.
It is known that the sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n - 6$.
However, since 2026 is in layer 27, the numbers around are 1952, 1953, ..., 2106, 2107.
Let's analyze the arrangement of numbers in layers.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Layer 3: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
Consider the numbers surrounding 2026. Since $2026 = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$ is not satisfied for any integer $k$, the number 2026 may not be in the spiral.
The six neighboring numbers are 2025, 2027, 2023, 2029, some other two numbers.
The sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026)-6$.

The sum of the six neighbors of $n$ is $6n$.
So, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is approximately $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
