Let the hexagonal grid be arranged such that the number 1 is at the center. The numbers are written in a spiral pattern.
The number 1 is at the center. The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
We can represent the coordinates of the numbers in the hexagonal grid.
The coordinate system can be based on three directions, $x, y, z$, such that $x+y+z=0$.

The numbers are arranged in layers around the origin, with 1 at the origin.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Layer 3: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
Layer $n$: $6n(n-1)+1$ is the largest number in layer $n$.
We want to find the layer that 2026 belongs to.
We can estimate $n$ such that $6n(n-1)+1 \approx 2026$.
$6n^2 - 6n + 1 \approx 2026$
$6n^2 - 6n - 2025 \approx 0$
$n^2 - n - \frac{2025}{6} \approx 0$
$n^2 - n - \frac{675}{2} \approx 0$
$n \approx \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(\frac{675}{2})}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 1350}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1351}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 36.75}{2}$
$n \approx \frac{1+36.75}{2} \approx \frac{37.75}{2} \approx 18.87$
So 2026 is in layer 19.
We can check: $6(18)(17)+1 = 6(306)+1 = 1836+1 = 1837$
$6(19)(18)+1 = 6(342)+1 = 2052+1 = 2053$
So 2026 is in layer 19.
We have $6(n-1)(n-2)+1 \le 2026 \le 6(n-1)n+1$.
$6(18)(17)+1 = 1837$
$6(19)(18)+1 = 2053$
So 2026 is in layer 19.
The largest number in layer 18 is $6(18)(17)+1 = 1837$.
The numbers in layer 19 are $1838, 1839, \dots, 2053$.
2026 is in layer 19.

Let the number be $x$. Its 6 neighbors are $x-1, x+1, x-1-1, x+1+1, x+x+1, x-x-1$.
The neighbors are $x-1, x+1$ and four other numbers.

Let's consider the coordinates of the numbers in the hexagonal grid.
The coordinates of 1 are $(0, 0, 0)$.
The coordinates of 2 are $(1, 0, -1)$.
The coordinates of 3 are $(1, -1, 0)$.
The coordinates of 4 are $(0, -1, 1)$.
The coordinates of 5 are $(-1, 0, 1)$.
The coordinates of 6 are $(-1, 1, 0)$.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, $x, y, z, w$.
The sum of the neighbors of a number $n$ is $6n-6$ (for $n>1$).
The neighbors have the form $n-1, n+1$ and four other numbers that are approximately $n$.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 is close to $6(2026) = 12156$.
However, this is not correct.

It seems that the sum of the 6 neighbors of $n$ is around $6n$.
The 6 neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The sum is 20.
The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2 is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9. The sum is 33.
The sum of the 6 neighbors of 3 is 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10. The sum is 30.
The sum of the 6 neighbors of 4 is 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11. The sum is 36.

Let's try to find a pattern.
The sum of the 6 neighbors of $n$ is $6n \pm k$.

The average of the neighbors of $n$ is somewhat close to $n$.
The 6 neighbors of $n$ can be $n-1, n+1$ and 4 other neighbors.

Consider the sum of the neighbors is $12156$.

The neighbors of a number $n$ on the hexagonal grid are $n-1, n+1, n-d_1, n+d_1, n-d_2, n+d_2$.
The sum of the neighbors is $6n$.
The neighbors of 2026 are likely to be 2025, 2027, ...

The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2023, 2028, 2021, 2029. The sum is 12158.
$2025+2027+2023+2028+2021+2029 = 12153$.
2025, 2027 are adjacent.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 is $12153$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12153}$
