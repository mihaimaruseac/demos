Let the hexagonal grid be filled with natural numbers in a spiral manner, starting from 1 in the center. Let the numbers be arranged such that the direction of the spiral is to move to the right, then up-right, then up-left, then left, then down-left, and down-right.
We have the numbers arranged in a spiral as follows:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
The first few numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...
The numbers are arranged in concentric layers.
Let's observe the pattern of the numbers. The center number is 1.
Layer 1: 1 (1 number)
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6 numbers)
Layer 3: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (9 numbers)
Layer 4: 16, 17, ..., 24 (12 numbers)
The number of numbers in layer $n$ is $6(n-1)$.

We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026.
Let's find the layer that contains 2026. Let $S_n$ be the sum of the numbers in the first $n$ layers. Then $S_n = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^n 6(i-1) = 1 + 6\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = 1 + 6\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 - 3n + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \ge 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \ge 0$
We can solve $n^2 - n - 675 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
So $n \approx \frac{1+51.97}{2} \approx 26.48$ or $n \approx \frac{1-51.97}{2} \approx -25.48$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we have $n=27$.
Then $S_{26} = 3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
$S_{27} = 3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 < 2107$, 2026 is in the 27th layer.
The number of numbers in the 27th layer is $6(27-1) = 6(26) = 156$.
The starting number in the 27th layer is $1952$.
To find the position of 2026, we can calculate $2026 - 1951 = 75$. So 2026 is the 75th number in the 27th layer.
Let the neighbors of 2026 be $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, N_5, N_6$ in clockwise order. The sum of the neighbors is likely to be constant.
Since $n=27$, the numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid.
In the 27th layer, the numbers are $1952, \dots, 2107$.
Let's look for a pattern. The coordinates of the numbers are related to their value. In the $n$-th layer, the difference between two neighboring numbers is either 1 or something else.
The number 2026 is close to the center of the spiral.
Consider the example in the problem statement. The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Their sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27$.
The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 5, 6, 4.
In general, the sum of the 6 neighbors of $N$ is approximately $6N$.
Since the number is 2026, the sum of its six neighbors is likely to be $6(2026) = 12156$. However, we know that the spiral structure affects the sum.

The neighbors of a number $N$ in the spiral are $N-1, N+1, N-2, N+2, N-3, N+3$.
In the spiral, the numbers are arranged in the following order:
$N, N+1, N+2, \dots$
Let the six neighbors of 2026 be $a, b, c, d, e, f$.
The sum of the six neighbors is $a+b+c+d+e+f$.
We are looking for consecutive numbers around 2026.
The average of the six neighbors is close to 2026. If the neighbors are equidistant, the neighbors are approximately 2026 - 1.5, 2026 - 0.5, 2026 + 0.5, 2026 + 1.5, etc.
However, we know the hexagonal grid arrangement.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
