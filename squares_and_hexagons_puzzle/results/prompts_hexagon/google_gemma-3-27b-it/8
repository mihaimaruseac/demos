Let the spiral be laid out on a hexagonal grid. The numbers are written in the spiral order. We are given a sample layout:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let's write down the sequence of numbers in the spiral: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...
These numbers are arranged in a hexagonal spiral.
We observe the spiral pattern. The number 1 is at the center.
The next numbers form a ring around 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The next numbers form a ring around these numbers: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...

The numbers are arranged in layers around the center.
Layer 0: 1
Layer 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Layer 2: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...
We can estimate the layer number of 2026.
The number of elements in layer $n$ is $6n$ for $n > 0$.
The total number of elements in layers 0 through $n$ is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^n 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3n^2 + 3n - 2025 \ge 0$
$n^2 + n - 675 \ge 0$
Using the quadratic formula, we have
$n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(-675)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+2700}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{-1 \pm 51.97}{2}$
Since $n > 0$, we have $n \approx \frac{50.97}{2} \approx 25.5$. Thus, we can consider $n=25$ and $n=26$.
When $n=25$, $3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
When $n=26$, $3(26)^2 + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
So 2026 is in layer 26.
Since 1951 numbers are in layers 0 to 25, 2026 is the $2026 - 1951 = 75$-th number in layer 26.
We can approximate the neighbors of a number in the spiral.
Let $N$ be the number 2026. The sum of neighbors of $N$ is approximately $6N$.
However, we have the fact that the average of the six neighbors is close to the actual number.
The neighbors of 2026 are roughly 2020 to 2032, so the sum of the 6 neighbors is approximately $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.
Let's use the observation that the sum of neighbors of $n$ is $6n$. So the sum of neighbors of 2026 is $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

We have the numbers around 2026 arranged in a hexagonal pattern.
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $2020 + 2021 + 2023 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 = 12143$.
The average of the neighbors must be close to 2026, so we must be around 2026.
Consider the 6 numbers around 2026: 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2027, 2028. Their sum is 12143.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
