Let the hexagonal grid be centered at 1. We are looking for the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026.
The hexagonal spiral is constructed by starting at 1 and spiraling outward. The numbers are arranged in hexagons with increasing layer numbers. Let $L$ be the layer number, where $L=1$ is the center with the number 1.
We want to find the layer number of 2026.
We know that the numbers in the $n$-th layer are approximately $3n(n-1)+1$.
Let $3n(n-1)+1 \approx 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n + 1 \approx 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \approx 0$.
$n^2 - n - 675 \approx 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, $n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
Since $n$ must be positive, $n \approx \frac{1 + 51.97}{2} \approx \frac{52.97}{2} \approx 26.48$.
So, the number 2026 is in layer 27.

We can look at the hexagon spiral. The numbers in the center are arranged as follows:
1
2, 3, 4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
...
The number of cells in layer $n$ is $6(n-1)$.
The total number of cells in layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6(k-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = 1 + 6 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
For layer $n=26$, the number of cells is $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
For layer $n=27$, the number of cells is $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
2026 is in layer 27. The first term in layer 27 is 1952.
$2026 - 1952 = 74$, so 2026 is the 74th term in layer 27.

The sum of the six neighbors of $n$ are $n-1, n-6, n-5, n+1, n+6, n+5$. The sum is $6n$.
If $n$ is 2026, then the sum of the neighbors is $6(2026) = 12156$.
However, this assumes that the neighbors exist.
In a hexagonal grid, the neighbors of a number $n$ are $n-1, n-6, n-5, n+1, n+6, n+5$.
So the neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2020, 2021, 2027, 2032, 2031.
The sum is $2025 + 2020 + 2021 + 2027 + 2032 + 2031 = 12156$.
Since 2026 is in the middle of layer 27, it has 6 neighbors.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
