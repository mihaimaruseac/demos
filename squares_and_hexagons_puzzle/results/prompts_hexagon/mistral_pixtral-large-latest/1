To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the hexagonal spiral and identify the neighbors of the number 2026 within this pattern.

1. **Understanding the Spiral Structure:**

   The given spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid. Each layer of the spiral contains more numbers than the previous one. To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine which layer it belongs to and then find its position within that layer.

2. **Determining the Layer:**

   Let's denote the layers starting from 1 at the center. The first layer contains only one number (1). The second layer contains a ring of 6 numbers around the first layer (2 to 7), the third layer contains a ring of 12 numbers around the second layer, and so on.

   The number of elements in each layer follows the pattern: \(6(n-1)\) for the \(n\)-th layer.

   To find which layer 2026 belongs to, we need to sum the numbers in each layer until we exceed 2026.

   The cumulative sum of numbers up to the \(n\)-th layer is given by:
   \[
   S_n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1))
   \]
   Using the formula for the sum of the first \(n-1\) integers:
   \[
   S_n = 1 + 6 \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   S_n = 1 + 3n(n-1)
   \]

3. **Finding the Layer for 2026:**

   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1 + 3n(n-1) \geq 2026
   \]
   Solving this inequality:
   \[
   3n(n-1) \geq 2025
   \]
   \[
   n(n-1) \geq 675
   \]
   By trial and error or using the quadratic formula, we find that \(n = 27\) is the smallest integer satisfying this inequality.

   Therefore, 2026 is in the 27th layer.

4. **Position within the Layer:**

   The 27th layer starts at:
   \[
   S_{26} = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
   \]
   So, 2026 is the \(2026 - 1951 + 1 = 76\)-th number in the 27th layer.

5. **Finding the Neighbors:**

   In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number in the \(n\)-th layer, its neighbors are:
   - The previous number in the layer.
   - The next number in the layer.
   - Two numbers from the previous layer.
   - Two numbers from the next layer.

   For 2026 (the 76th number in the 27th layer):
   - Previous number: 2025
   - Next number: 2027
   - Numbers from the previous layer (26th layer): 2025 - 26 and 2025 - 25
   - Numbers from the next layer (28th layer): 2027 + 26 and 2027 + 27

   Therefore, the neighbors are:
   - 2025
   - 2027
   - 2025 - 26 = 2000 - 1 = 1999
   - 2025 - 25 = 1999
   - 2027 + 26 = 2053
   - 2027 + 27 = 2054

6. **Sum of the Neighbors:**
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 1999 + 1999 + 2053 + 2054 = 12157
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{12157} \).
