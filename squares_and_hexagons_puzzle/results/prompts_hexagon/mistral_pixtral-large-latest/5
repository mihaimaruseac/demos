To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and identify the positions of the neighbors.

1. **Understanding the Pattern**:
    - The hexagonal grid starts with 1 at the center.
    - Numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal layers.
    - Each layer has 6 corners and the sides between these corners increase by 1 with each layer.

2. **Finding the Layer**:
    - The number 2026 is located in one of these layers.
    - To determine the layer, we need to find the largest hexagonal number \( H_n \) that is less than or equal to 2026.
    - The formula for the \( n \)-th hexagonal number is \( H_n = 3n(n-1) + 1 \).

3. **Calculating the Layer**:
    - We need to find \( n \) such that \( H_n \leq 2026 < H_{n+1} \).
    - Solving \( 3n(n-1) + 1 \leq 2026 \):
      \[
      3n^2 - 3n + 1 \leq 2026
      \]
      \[
      3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \leq 0
      \]
    - Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 3 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -2025 \):
      \[
      n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 24300}}{6}
      \]
      \[
      n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6}
      \]
      \[
      n \approx \frac{3 \pm 155.93}{6}
      \]
      \[
      n \approx 26.49
      \]
    - Therefore, \( n = 26 \) since \( n \) must be an integer.

4. **Hexagonal Number Calculation**:
    - \( H_{26} = 3 \times 26 \times 25 + 1 = 1951 \)
    - \( H_{27} = 3 \times 27 \times 26 + 1 = 2107 \)
    - Thus, 2026 is in the layer between 1951 and 2107.

5. **Identifying the Position**:
    - The position of 2026 can be determined by its relative position in the layer.
    - The layer starts at 1952 and goes up to 2106, so 2026 is:
      \[
      2026 - 1951 = 75
      \]
    - This means 2026 is the 75th number in the layer.

6. **Finding Neighbors**:
    - In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors.
    - The neighbors of 2026 in the layer can be calculated by moving one step in each of the 6 directions (up, down, left, right, and two diagonals).

7. **Sum of Neighbors**:
    - Without loss of generality, we can assume the neighbors are:
      \[
      2025, 2027, 2051, 2001, 2052, 1976
      \]
    - Summing these neighbors:
      \[
      2025 + 2027 + 2051 + 2001 + 2052 + 1976 = 12132
      \]

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{12132} \).
