To find the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal spiral, we need to determine the layout of the numbers around 2026.

The hexagonal spiral can be visualized as a series of concentric hexagonal rings, where each ring contains a specific number of elements. For any number \( n \) in such a spiral, the number of elements in each complete ring can be determined.

Let's outline the steps to determine the neighbors of 2026:

1. **Determine the Ring Number:**
   - The first ring (innermost) contains only 1 number: \( 1 \).
   - The second ring contains 6 numbers: \( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \).
   - The third ring contains 12 numbers.
   - The fourth ring contains 18 numbers.
   - Generally, the \( k \)-th ring contains \( 6(k-1) \) numbers.

   To find which ring the number 2026 belongs to, we need to sum the numbers in the rings until we reach or exceed 2026.

2. **Sum of Numbers in Rings:**
   - Sum of the first \( k \) rings can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_k = 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + \cdots + 6(k-1)
     \]
   - This is an arithmetic series with the first term \( a = 1 \) and common difference \( d = 6 \).
   - The sum of the first \( k \) terms of this series is:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{k}{2} \left(2a + (k-1)d\right) = \frac{k}{2} \left(2 + 6(k-1)\right) = k(3k-2)
     \]

3. **Find the Ring for 2026:**
   - We need \( k \) such that \( k(3k-2) \leq 2026 < (k+1)(3(k+1)-2) \).
   - By trial or calculation, we find \( k = 26 \) because:
     \[
     26(3 \cdot 26 - 2) = 26 \cdot 76 = 1976
     \]
     \[
     27(3 \cdot 27 - 2) = 27 \cdot 79 = 2133
     \]
   - Therefore, 2026 is in the 27th ring.

4. **Position in the Ring:**
   - The 27th ring starts at 1977 and ends at 2132.
   - 2026 is the \( 2026 - 1976 = 50 \)-th number in the 27th ring.

5. **Neighbors in the Hexagonal Grid:**
   - In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number in the middle of a side of a hexagonal ring, the neighbors are the preceding and following numbers in the ring and four numbers from adjacent rings.
   - For 2026, the neighbors are:
     1. 2025 (previous in the ring)
     2. 2027 (next in the ring)
     3. 1970 (inner ring, directly adjacent)
     4. 1971 (inner ring, diagonally adjacent)
     5. 2131 (outer ring, directly adjacent)
     6. 2132 (outer ring, diagonally adjacent)

6. **Sum of Neighbors:**
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 1970 + 1971 + 2131 + 2132 = 12256
   \]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{12256} \).
