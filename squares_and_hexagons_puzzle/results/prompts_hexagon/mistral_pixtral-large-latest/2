To determine the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal spiral, we first need to understand the structure of such a spiral.

The hexagonal spiral can be thought of as layers or rings of hexagons surrounding a central point. Each layer contains a specific pattern of numbers.

1. **Determine the Layer of 2026:**
   - The central number is 1.
   - The first layer (closest to the center) contains the numbers 2 to 7.
   - The second layer contains numbers 8 to 19.
   - The third layer contains numbers 20 to 37, and so on.

   The general pattern for the \(n\)-th layer is that it contains \(6n\) numbers.

2. **Calculate the Total Numbers Before 2026:**
   - We need to find which layer contains the number 2026.
   - The total number of elements up to the \(n\)-th layer is given by the sum of the first \(n\) layers plus 1 (the central number).

   The sum of the first \(n\) layers is:
   \[
   S_n = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = 1 + 6 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
   \]

   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1 + 3n(n+1) \leq 2026 < 1 + 3(n+1)(n+2)
   \]

3. **Solve for \(n\):**
   - Approximate \(n\) by solving \(3n(n+1) \approx 2025\):
   \[
   3n^2 + 3n \approx 2025 \implies n^2 + n - 675 \approx 0
   \]
   - Solve the quadratic equation \(n^2 + n - 675 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
   \[
   n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
   \]
   - Approximate \(\sqrt{2701} \approx 52\):
   \[
   n = \frac{-1 \pm 52}{2} \implies n \approx 25.5
   \]
   - Since \(n\) must be an integer, we check \(n = 25\):
   \[
   1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
   \]
   - And for \(n = 26\):
   \[
   1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
   \]
   - Thus, 2026 is in the 26th layer.

4. **Find the Position of 2026 in the 26th Layer:**
   - The 26th layer starts at 1952 and ends at 2106.
   - 2026 is the \(2026 - 1951 = 75\)-th number in the 26th layer.

5. **Determine the Neighbors:**
   - In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors.
   - For a number \(x\) in the \(n\)-th layer, the neighbors are located at \(x-1\), \(x+1\), and four other positions depending on the exact layout within the layer.

   Given the complexity of the hexagonal layout, we can deduce the neighbors of 2026 as follows:
   - 2025 and 2027 are direct neighbors.
   - The other four neighbors depend on the exact positioning within the hexagonal grid, but typically they would be \(2026 \pm 25\) and \(2026 \pm 26\) due to the hexagonal structure.

6. **Calculate the Sum of Neighbors:**
   - Neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2000, 2001, 2051, and 2052.
   - Sum these values:
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2001 + 2051 + 2052 = 12156
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{12156} \).
