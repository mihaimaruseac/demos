To solve the problem of finding the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal spiral of natural numbers, let's understand the structure of the spiral first.

The spiral can be visualized as starting from the center and expanding outward in a hexagonal pattern. Each "layer" of the spiral contains increasingly more numbers, and the numbers in each layer form a ring around the previous layer.

To analyze the spiral, let's consider the position of 2026 in the spiral. Each layer of the spiral can be categorized by the side length of the hexagon it forms. For a hexagon of side length \( n \), the number of elements in that layer is \( 6n \).

To locate 2026 in the spiral, we need to determine which layer it belongs to. We start by calculating the total number of elements up to each layer.

The total number of elements up to the \( k \)-th layer is given by:

\[ 1 + 6 \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = 1 + 6 \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) = 1 + 3k(k+1) \]

Let's find the layer where 2026 is located:

\[ 1 + 3k(k+1) \leq 2026 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ 3k^2 + 3k + 1 \leq 2026 \]
\[ 3k^2 + 3k \leq 2025 \]
\[ k^2 + k \leq 675 \]
\[ k^2 + k - 675 \leq 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -675 \):

\[ k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} \]
\[ k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \]

Approximating \( \sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97 \):

\[ k = \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 25.48 \]

So, \( k = 25 \) since \( k \) must be an integer.

Now, let's calculate the total number of elements up to the 25th layer:

\[ 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \]

2026 is in the 26th layer because:

\[ 1951 < 2026 \leq 1951 + 6 \cdot 26 = 2167 \]

Within the 26th layer, 2026 is the \( 2026 - 1951 = 75 \)-th element.

Each layer of the spiral has six neighbors, and the neighbors of 2026 will be the elements immediately before and after it in the sequence of the 26th layer, as well as the corresponding elements in the adjacent layers.

Since 2026 is the 75th element in the 26th layer, its neighbors are:

- The 74th element in the 26th layer: \( 2025 \)
- The 76th element in the 26th layer: \( 2027 \)
- The corresponding elements in the 25th layer (which are adjacent to the 75th element in the 26th layer): \( 1950, 1952, 2100, 2102 \)

Thus, the neighbors of 2026 are \( 2025, 2027, 1950, 1952, 2100, 2102 \).

Summing these neighbors:

\[ 2025 + 2027 + 1950 + 1952 + 2100 + 2102 = 12156 \]

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{12156} \).
