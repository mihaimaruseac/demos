To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 on the grid and then identify the numbers that are adjacent to it.

However, the provided grid only shows a small portion of the numbers, and 2026 is not among them. To proceed, we would need additional information about the pattern of the numbers on the grid or the specific position of 2026 within the grid.

If you can provide the complete grid or the position of 2026, I can help you calculate the sum of its neighbors. Otherwise, with the current information, it is not possible to determine the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
