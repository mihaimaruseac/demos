To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the grid. However, the provided grid does not extend to the number 2026, and there is no pattern given to extend the grid. Without additional information or a pattern to follow, it is not possible to determine the exact position of 2026 on the grid or its neighbors.

If we assume that the grid continues in a similar spiral pattern, we would need to know the direction and the step size of the spiral to determine the position of 2026 and its neighbors. Without this information, we cannot calculate the sum of the neighbors.

If you can provide more information about the pattern or the rules governing the spiral on the hexagonal grid, I can assist you further in finding the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
