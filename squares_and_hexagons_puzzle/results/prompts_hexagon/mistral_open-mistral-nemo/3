To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 and then identify the numbers that are adjacent to it in a hexagonal pattern.

However, the given grid only shows a small portion of the spiral, and the number 2026 is not present in the provided grid. To find the position of 2026, we would need additional information about the progression of the spiral or the pattern in which the numbers are written.

Without this information, it is not possible to determine the exact position of 2026 or its neighbors on the hexagonal grid. If you can provide more details about the spiral's progression or the pattern of the numbers, I can help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
