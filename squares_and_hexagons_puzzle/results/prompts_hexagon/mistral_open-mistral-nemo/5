To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 and then identify its neighbors.

Since the numbers are written on a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors. However, the arrangement of the numbers is not explicitly shown in the provided pattern. Without a clear understanding of how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid, it is not possible to determine the exact position of 2026 or its neighbors.

If you can provide more information about the arrangement of the numbers on the hexagonal grid, I can help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026. Otherwise, please provide additional details or clarify the arrangement of the numbers on the grid.
