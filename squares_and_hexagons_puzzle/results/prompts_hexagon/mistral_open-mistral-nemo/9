To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to determine the position of 2026 on the hexagonal grid and then identify the numbers that are adjacent to it.

However, the pattern of the numbers on the hexagonal grid is not provided in the question, and without this pattern, it is not possible to determine the position of 2026 or its neighbors.

If you can provide the pattern or the rules by which the numbers are placed on the hexagonal grid, I can help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
