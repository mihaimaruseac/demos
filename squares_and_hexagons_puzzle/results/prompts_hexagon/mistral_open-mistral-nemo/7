To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the positions of the neighbors. On a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors: one above, one below, and one on each side.

Let's assume that the number 2026 is at the center of the hexagonal grid. The neighbors would be arranged in a hexagonal pattern around it. However, without a visual representation or more information about the specific layout of the grid, it's not possible to determine the exact positions of the neighbors or their values.

If we had the layout of the grid or knew the positions of the neighbors relative to 2026, we could calculate the sum. But with the information given, we cannot proceed further to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
