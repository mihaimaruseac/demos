To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 on the grid and then identify the numbers that are adjacent to it.

Since the grid is hexagonal, each number has six neighbors: two above, two below, and one on each side. However, due to the spiral nature of the grid, the neighbors of a given number might not be in a perfect hexagonal pattern. We need to consider the direction of the spiral to determine the exact positions of the neighbors.

Given the pattern in the provided example, it seems that the numbers are increasing as we move in a spiral pattern around the center. However, without a complete map of the grid or a clear rule for the spiral direction, it's not possible to determine the exact positions of the neighbors of 2026.

If we had a complete map or a clear rule for the spiral direction, we could find the neighbors of 2026 and then calculate their sum. Without that information, we cannot provide an accurate answer to the question. If you can provide more details about the grid or the spiral pattern, I would be happy to help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
