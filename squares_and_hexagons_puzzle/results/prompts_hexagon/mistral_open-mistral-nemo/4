To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 on the grid and then identify its neighbors.

However, the grid provided in the question does not extend to the number 2026, and we cannot determine the exact position of 2026 on the grid without additional information. The numbers on the grid provided are much smaller than 2026, and the pattern of the numbers does not give us a clear indication of how to find the number 2026 or its neighbors.

If we assume that the numbers are written in a spiral pattern starting from the center and moving outwards, we can try to estimate the position of 2026. However, this is purely speculative without a clear pattern or more information about the grid.

If you can provide more details about the grid, such as the direction of the spiral, the size of the grid, or the pattern of the numbers, I could help you determine the sum of the neighbors of 2026. Otherwise, with the information given, it is not possible to calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
