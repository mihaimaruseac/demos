To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the position of 2026 first. However, the given spiral pattern only shows a small portion of the grid, and we don't have enough information to determine the exact position of 2026 or the numbers around it.

Without additional information about the pattern or the size of the grid, we cannot accurately calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026. If you can provide more details about the grid or the pattern, I would be happy to help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
