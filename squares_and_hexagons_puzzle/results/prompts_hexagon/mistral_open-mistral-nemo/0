To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on a hexagonal grid, we need to determine the positions of the neighbors. Since the grid is hexagonal, the neighbors will be arranged in a hexagonal pattern around the center number.

Let's assume that the number 2026 is at the center of the hexagon. The neighbors would be placed at the following positions relative to the center:

1. Directly above
2. Above and to the left
3. Above and to the right
4. Below and to the left
5. Below and to the right
6. Directly below

However, without the actual layout of the numbers on the grid, we cannot determine the exact values of the neighbors. If you can provide the layout or the positions of the numbers around 2026, I can calculate the sum of the neighbors for you.
