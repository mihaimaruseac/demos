I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then determine its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- The spiral continues counterclockwise: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...

The spiral forms hexagonal rings around the center. Let me analyze the pattern:
- Ring 0: just the number 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 6n numbers

The last number in ring n is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≈ 25.9

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1876 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Ring 26 starts at: 1952
Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in this ring.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total.

Now I need to determine the position. Each ring forms a hexagon with 26 numbers on each side (excluding corners). The ring starts at the bottom-right position and goes counterclockwise.

The 75th position in ring 26:
- Each side has 26 numbers
- First side (bottom-right to right corner): positions 1-26
- Second side (right corner to top-right): positions 27-52
- Third side (top-right to top-left): positions 53-78

So position 75 is on the third side, specifically the 75-52 = 23rd position on that side.

The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal spiral are:
1. The previous number in the spiral (2025)
2. The next number in the spiral (2027)
3. The number in the same position in the inner ring (ring 25)
4. The number in the same position in the outer ring (ring 27)
5. Two numbers in the same ring (adjacent positions on the hexagon)

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Previous in spiral: 2025
- Next in spiral: 2027
- Inner ring (ring 25): The corresponding position in ring 25 would be around position 72-73 in that ring, which is number 1951 + 72 = 2023
- Outer ring (ring 27): The corresponding position would be around position 78 in ring 27, starting at 2108, so approximately 2108 + 77 = 2185
- Same ring neighbors: 2024 and 2028 (approximately)

Wait, let me reconsider. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has exactly 6 neighbors. For 2026:
- 2025 (previous in spiral)
- 2027 (next in spiral)
- Inner ring neighbor: 2024
- Outer ring neighbor: 2185
- Two more neighbors in adjacent rings: 2186 and 2023

Actually, let me be more precise. The six neighbors in a hexagonal grid are determined by the exact position. Without loss of generality, the neighbors of 2026 would be:
- 2025 (counter-clockwise in same ring)
- 2027 (clockwise in same ring)
- 1869 (inner ring, same angular position)
- 1870 (inner ring, adjacent position)
- 2185 (outer ring, same angular position)
- 2186 (outer ring, adjacent position)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1869 + 1870 + 2185 + 2186 = 12162
