I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 1 + 6 = 7 numbers total
- Ring 2: 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 numbers total
- Ring 3: 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 37 numbers total

For ring k: Total = 1 + 3k(k+1)

I need 1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
3k(k+1) ≥ 2025
k(k+1) ≥ 675

Testing values:
- k = 25: 25 × 26 = 650 (too small)
- k = 26: 26 × 27 = 702 (this works!)

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total, numbered from 1952 to 2107.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring forms a hexagon. The numbers are placed consecutively along the perimeter. In ring 26, number 2026 is at position 75 out of 156.

The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal spiral are:
1. The previous and next numbers in the same ring (2025 and 2027)
2. Two numbers from the inner ring (ring 25)
3. Two numbers from the outer ring (ring 27)

For the inner ring (ring 25) neighbors:
Ring 25 has 150 numbers (1802-1951). The position correspondence needs to account for the hexagonal structure. Position 75 in ring 26 corresponds to approximately position 75 × (150/156) ≈ 72.1 in ring 25.

The two inner neighbors would be around positions 72 and 73 in ring 25, which are numbers 1802 + 71 = 1873 and 1802 + 72 = 1874.

For the outer ring (ring 27) neighbors:
Ring 27 has 162 numbers (2108-2269). Position 75 in ring 26 corresponds to approximately position 75 × (162/156) ≈ 77.9 in ring 27.

The two outer neighbors would be around positions 78 and 79 in ring 27, which are numbers 2108 + 77 = 2185 and 2108 + 78 = 2186.

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring: 1873, 1874  
- Outer ring: 2185, 2186

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2185 + 2186 = 12,170
