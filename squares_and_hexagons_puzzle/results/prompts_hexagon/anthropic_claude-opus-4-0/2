I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then find its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
3k(k+1) ≥ 2025
k(k+1) ≥ 675

Solving: k² + k - 675 ≥ 0
k ≈ (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 ≈ (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.49

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring starts at the bottom position and goes counterclockwise. The 75th position out of 156 means we've gone 75/156 ≈ 0.48 of the way around the ring.

Since 156 = 6 × 26, each side of the hexagon in ring 26 has 26 numbers. Position 75 means:
- First side (bottom): positions 1-26
- Second side (bottom-left): positions 27-52  
- Third side (top-left): positions 53-78

So position 75 is on the third side (top-left), specifically the 75-52 = 23rd position on that side.

The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal spiral are:
1. Previous number in the spiral: 2025
2. Next number in the spiral: 2027
3. Number in the same position in ring 25
4. Number in the same position in ring 27
5. Two more neighbors from adjacent positions in adjacent rings

For position 75 in ring 26:
- Numbers 2025 and 2027 (adjacent in spiral)
- Position 75 in ring 25: Since ring 25 has 150 numbers and ring 26 position 75 corresponds to about 75/156 ≈ 0.48 through the ring, in ring 25 this is position 0.48 × 150 ≈ 72. This is number 1951 + 72 = 2023
- Position 75 in ring 27: Similarly, this corresponds to position 0.48 × 162 ≈ 78 in ring 27. This is number 2107 + 78 = 2185

For the last two neighbors, they are at adjacent angular positions but in adjacent rings. These are approximately:
- Position 73 in ring 25: 1951 + 73 = 2024  
- Position 79 in ring 27: 2107 + 79 = 2186

However, let me reconsider the exact neighbor pattern in a hexagonal grid. If 2026 is on a side of the hexagon, its six neighbors are:
- Previous and next in the spiral (2025, 2027)
- Two from the inner ring 25
- Two from the outer ring 27

Given that 2026 is well within a side (not at a corner), the neighbors from adjacent rings follow a regular pattern. 

The sum of the six neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2185 + 2186 = 12470
