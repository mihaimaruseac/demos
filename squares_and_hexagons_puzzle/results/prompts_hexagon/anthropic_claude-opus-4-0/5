I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then determine its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2,3,4,5,6,7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 (12 numbers)
- Ring n: 6n numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

To find which ring 2026 is in:
1 + 3n(n+1) < 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 < 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 < 0

Using the quadratic formula:
n ≈ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 ≈ (-3 + √24309)/6 ≈ (-3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total. The hexagonal spiral fills each ring by moving along the 6 sides. In ring n, each side has n numbers.

In ring 26, each side has 26 numbers. The 75th position means we've completed 2 full sides (52 numbers) and are 23 numbers into the third side.

Now I need to find the neighbors. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. For a number in ring n:
- 2 neighbors are in the same ring (adjacent positions along the spiral)
- 2 neighbors are in ring n-1 
- 2 neighbors are in ring n+1

The neighbors of position 75 in ring 26 are:
- In ring 26: positions 74 and 76
- In ring 25: two specific positions
- In ring 27: two specific positions

Position 74 in ring 26: 1951 + 74 = 2025
Position 76 in ring 26: 1951 + 76 = 2027

For the ring 25 neighbors: Ring 25 has 150 numbers. The corresponding positions connect to position 75 of ring 26. Due to the hexagonal structure, these are approximately at positions 71 and 72 in ring 25.
Position 71 in ring 25: 1801 + 71 = 1872
Position 72 in ring 25: 1801 + 72 = 1873

For the ring 27 neighbors: Ring 27 starts at 2108. The positions that connect are approximately at positions 77 and 78 in ring 27.
Position 77 in ring 27: 2107 + 77 = 2184
Position 78 in ring 27: 2107 + 78 = 2185

Therefore, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1872, 1873, 2184, 2185

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185 = 12166
