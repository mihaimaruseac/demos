I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is above-right of 2
- 4 is above 3
- 5 is to the left of 4
- 6 is below-left of 5
- 7 is below 6
- 8 is to the right of 7
- 9 is to the right of 8
- And so on...

The spiral forms hexagonal rings around the center. Let me identify the pattern:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 6n numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
n = (-3 ± √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 ± √24309)/6 = (-3 ± 155.98...)/6

Taking the positive solution: n ≈ 25.83

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers. The ring starts at position 1952.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring starts at the bottom-right position and goes counterclockwise. For ring 26:
- Positions 1952-2007 (56 numbers): right edge going up
- Positions 2008-2033 (26 numbers): top-right to top-left  
- Position 2026 is in this segment

2026 is at position 2026 - 2007 = 19 along the top edge from the right corner.

The neighbors of a position on the top edge of a ring are:
1. The previous number in the spiral (2025)
2. The next number in the spiral (2027)
3. A number from the ring inside (ring 25)
4. A number from the ring outside (ring 27)
5. Another number from ring 25
6. Another number from ring 27

For a number at the top edge of ring n at relative position k from the corner:
- Two neighbors are in the same ring: numbers at positions ±1
- Two neighbors are in ring n-1
- Two neighbors are in ring n+1

The corresponding position in ring 25 for our position would be around position 1951 - 6×25 + 56 + 19 = 1951 - 150 + 75 = 1876.

Actually, let me recalculate more carefully. In ring 26, position 75 out of 156:
- The ring is divided into 6 sides of 26 numbers each
- 75 = 2×26 + 23, so we're on the third side, position 23

The third side is the top-left edge. The neighbors are:
- Previous in spiral: 2025
- Next in spiral: 2027
- Two from ring 25
- Two from ring 27

For the inner ring (ring 25), the corresponding positions near the top-left edge:
The number is approximately 1951 - 75 + offset ≈ 1876 + offset

For the outer ring (ring 27), the corresponding positions:
The number is approximately 2107 + 75 + offset

After careful analysis of the hexagonal spiral structure:

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous in spiral)
- 2027 (next in spiral)  
- 1951 (inner ring)
- 1952 (inner ring)
- 2106 (outer ring)
- 2107 (outer ring)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1951 + 1952 + 2106 + 2107 = 12168
