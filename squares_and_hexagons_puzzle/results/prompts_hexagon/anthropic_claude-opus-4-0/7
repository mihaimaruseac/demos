I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

To find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
- Ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

Now I need to understand the position. In a hexagonal spiral:
- Each ring starts at the "east" position and goes counterclockwise
- Ring 26 starts with number 1952

The 75th position in ring 26 corresponds to number 2026.

In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number in ring k:
- 2 neighbors are in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- 2 neighbors are in ring k-1 
- 2 neighbors are in ring k+1

For 2026 (the 75th number in ring 26):
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027
- Inner ring (ring 25) neighbors: I need to find which positions in ring 25 are adjacent
- Outer ring (ring 27) neighbors: I need to find which positions in ring 27 are adjacent

Let me work out the geometry. Ring 26 has 156 numbers, so each "side" of the hexagon has 26 numbers. The 75th position is approximately 75/156 ≈ 0.48 of the way around the ring.

Since each side has 26 numbers:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

Position 75 is on side 3, specifically the 23rd position on that side (75 - 52 = 23).

For the inner ring (ring 25) neighbors:
Ring 25 has 150 numbers. The corresponding positions would be around 75 × (150/156) ≈ 72.1

For the outer ring (ring 27) neighbors:
Ring 27 has 162 numbers. The corresponding positions would be around 75 × (162/156) ≈ 77.9

Due to the hexagonal structure, the actual neighbors are:
- In ring 25: positions 72 and 73 → numbers 1951 + 72 = 2023 and 1951 + 73 = 2024
- In ring 26: positions 74 and 76 → numbers 2025 and 2027
- In ring 27: positions 78 and 79 → numbers 2107 + 78 = 2185 and 2107 + 79 = 2186

Wait, let me reconsider. Ring 27 starts at 2107, not ends at 2107.
Ring 26 ends at 2107, so ring 27 starts at 2108.

So the outer neighbors are: 2108 + 77 = 2185 and 2108 + 78 = 2186

The six neighbors of 2026 are: 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2185, 2186

Sum = 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2185 + 2186 = 12,470
