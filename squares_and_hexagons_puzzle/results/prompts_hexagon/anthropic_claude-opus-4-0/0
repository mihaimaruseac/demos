I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (the first ring, 6 numbers)
- The second ring has 12 numbers: 8, 9, 10, ..., 19
- The third ring has 18 numbers: 20, 21, ..., 37
- Ring n has 6n numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 0: 1 number (total: 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (total: 7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (total: 19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (total: 37)
- ...
- Ring n: total = 1 + 3n(n+1)

I need: 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≥ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6 ≈ 25.47

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number depend on its position:
- If it's on a corner, it has neighbors from rings n-1, n, and n+1
- If it's on an edge (not corner), it has 2 neighbors in the same ring, 2 in ring n+1, and 2 in ring n-1

The 6 corners of ring 26 are at positions: 1, 27, 53, 79, 105, 131 (within the ring).

Position 75 is between corners at positions 53 and 79, so 2026 is on an edge.

For a number at position p in ring n (not at a corner):
- The two neighbors in the same ring are at positions p-1 and p+1
- The two neighbors in ring n-1 are more complex to calculate
- The two neighbors in ring n+1 are also complex to calculate

Let me work this out more carefully. In ring 26:
- Position 75 means we're 75-53 = 22 steps past the third corner
- Each edge has 26 numbers, so we're 22 steps along the fourth edge

The neighbors are:
1. In ring 26: positions 74 and 76 → numbers 2025 and 2027
2. In ring 25: I need to find which two numbers in ring 25 are adjacent to position 75 of ring 26
3. In ring 27: I need to find which two numbers in ring 27 are adjacent to position 75 of ring 26

For the ring 25 neighbors:
- Ring 25 starts at number 1952 and has 150 numbers
- The corresponding positions in ring 25 would be around position 71-72

For the ring 27 neighbors:
- Ring 27 starts at number 2108 and has 162 numbers  
- The corresponding positions in ring 27 would be around position 78-79

By the structure of hexagonal spirals:
- Ring 25 neighbors: 1952 + 70 = 2022 and 1952 + 71 = 2023
- Ring 27 neighbors: 2108 + 77 = 2185 and 2108 + 78 = 2186

Therefore, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
2022, 2023, 2025, 2027, 2185, 2186

Sum = 2022 + 2023 + 2025 + 2027 + 2185 + 2186 = 12468
