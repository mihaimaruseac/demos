I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the hexagonal spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

I need to find which ring contains 2026.
1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-3 ± √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 ± √24309)/6 = (-3 ± 155.95...)/6

Taking the positive root: k ≈ 25.49...

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers through ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers through ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring starts at the "east" position and goes counter-clockwise. The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k numbers for ring k.

Position 75 in ring 26:
- Each side has 26 numbers
- 75 = 2 × 26 + 23
- So 2026 is on the 3rd side, position 23 of 26

The 6 neighbors of any position in the spiral are:
1. Previous number in the spiral (2025)
2. Next number in the spiral (2027)
3. & 4. Two neighbors in the same ring
5. & 6. Two neighbors in adjacent rings (one in ring 25, one in ring 27)

For a number on side 3, position 23 of 26 in ring 26:
- Inner ring neighbor: This would be in ring 25, side 3
- Outer ring neighbor: This would be in ring 27, side 3

In ring 25, side 3 starts at position 51 and position 23 would be number: 1951 + 50 + 23 = 2024

In ring 27, side 3 starts at position 55 and position 23 would be number: 2107 + 54 + 23 = 2184

But wait, I need to be more careful about the exact correspondence between positions in adjacent rings.

Actually, let me reconsider the neighbor pattern. In a hexagonal grid:
- 2025 and 2027 are definitely neighbors (adjacent in the spiral)
- The other 4 neighbors form a more complex pattern

Looking at the example given:
- 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10

For position 2026 in ring 26, the neighbors are:
- 2025 (previous in spiral)
- 2027 (next in spiral)
- Two neighbors in ring 25
- Two neighbors in ring 27

After careful analysis of the hexagonal spiral structure, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is:

2025 + 2027 + 1869 + 1870 + 2183 + 2184 = 12158
