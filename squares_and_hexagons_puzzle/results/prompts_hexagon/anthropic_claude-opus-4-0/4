I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each ring k has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(k) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

I need to find which ring contains 2026.

Setting 1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026:
3k(k+1) ≥ 2025
k(k+1) ≥ 675

Testing values:
- k = 25: 25 × 26 = 650 < 675
- k = 26: 26 × 27 = 702 > 675

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers up to ring 25: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Numbers up to ring 26: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers, going from 1952 to 2107.

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers in each ring are placed consecutively around the hexagon. Each side of ring k has k numbers.

Position 75 in ring 26:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So 2026 is at position 75, which is on side 3, specifically the 23rd position on that side (75 - 52 = 23).

The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal spiral are:
1. The previous and next numbers in the same ring (2025 and 2027)
2. Two numbers from the inner ring (ring 25)
3. Two numbers from the outer ring (ring 27)

For the inner ring neighbors:
Ring 25 has 150 numbers (1802-1951).
The corresponding position in ring 25 would be around position 72-73.
Numbers around position 72-73 in ring 25: these would be 1802 + 72 = 1874 and 1875.

For the outer ring neighbors:
Ring 27 starts at 2108.
The corresponding positions would be around 77-78 in ring 27.
Numbers around position 77-78 in ring 27: these would be 2108 + 77 = 2185 and 2186.

However, I need to be more precise about the exact neighbor configuration in a hexagonal grid.

In a hexagonal spiral, for a number not at a corner:
- 2 neighbors are in the same ring (previous and next)
- 2 neighbors are in the inner ring
- 2 neighbors are in the outer ring

For 2026:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring (25): 1873, 1874
- Outer ring (27): 2184, 2185

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168
