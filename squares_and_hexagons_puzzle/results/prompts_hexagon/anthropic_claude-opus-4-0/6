I need to find the position of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and then determine its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the pattern. The spiral starts at 1 and moves outward in a hexagonal pattern. Looking at the given layout:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- The spiral continues counter-clockwise: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

In a hexagonal spiral:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 6n numbers (except ring 0)

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
- For n ≥ 1: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
- 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
- 3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0
- n² + n - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Numbers up to ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
Numbers up to ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6×26 = 156 numbers. Since 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26, it's roughly halfway around the ring.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides, and the numbers are distributed roughly equally. The 75th position out of 156 means we're at position 75/156 × 6 ≈ 2.88 sides around.

For a number in ring n > 1:
- It has 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous and next in sequence)
- It has 3 neighbors in ring n+1 
- It has 1 neighbor in ring n-1

For 2026 in ring 26:
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027
- The inner ring (ring 25) neighbor needs calculation
- The three outer ring (ring 27) neighbors need calculation

Since the spiral maintains a regular pattern, and 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26:
- Its inner neighbor is approximately the 75th number in ring 25 (adjusted for the different ring size)
- Ring 25 has 150 numbers, starting at 1802

The position correspondence between rings maintains a ratio. The 75th position in a ring of 156 corresponds to position 75×150/156 ≈ 72.1 in ring 25.

So the inner neighbor is approximately 1802 + 72 - 1 = 1873.

For the outer neighbors in ring 27:
- Ring 27 starts at 2107
- Ring 27 has 162 numbers
- The 75th position in ring 26 corresponds to positions around 75×162/156 ≈ 77.9 in ring 27

The three outer neighbors would be approximately at positions 77, 78, and 79 in ring 27, which are numbers 2183, 2184, and 2185.

Therefore, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring: 1873
- Outer ring: 2183, 2184, 2185

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 2183 + 2184 + 2185 = 12477
