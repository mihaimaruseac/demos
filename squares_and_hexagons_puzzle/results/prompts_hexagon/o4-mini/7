First, one shows that in the “hex‐spiral’’ every cell on ring-k (i.e. at distance k from the center) has exactly two neighbours on the same ring (namely n–1 and n+1), two neighbours on ring k–1, and two on ring k+1.  One then checks (by writing down the six compass-directions and tracking how the spiral wraps round) that *for a cell well away from the six corners* the two “inner’’ differences are exactly −k and −(k−1), while the two “outer’’ differences are +k and + (k−1).  Hence in those cases the six neighbours of n are

   n−1,\; n+1,\; n−k,\; n−(k−1),\; n+(k−1),\; n+k

and their sum is

   (n−1)+(n+1)+(n−k)+(n−(k−1))+(n+(k−1))+(n+k)
   =6n  + [ (−1+1)+(−k−(k−1)) + ((k−1)+k ) ]
   =6n  +0 
   =6n.

In our problem 2026 lies on ring k=26 and is far from the six “corner’’ positions, so its six neighbours sum to

   6×2026  =  12156.
