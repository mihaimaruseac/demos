First one shows a picture of the first few “rings” of the hex‐spiral.  Labeling the centre 1, the six neighbours 2 through 7, the next ring 8 through 19, etc., one finds that 2026 sits on ring 26 of the spiral.  A little bookkeeping (either by an explicit coordinate‐to‐index formula or by keeping track of the six “steps” one takes in each of the six directions on each successive ring) shows that the six neighbours of 2026 are

   2025, 2027   (the two adjacent numbers on the same ring),
   1873, 1874   (the two neighbours on the inner ring),
   2183, 2184   (the two neighbours on the outer ring).

Hence the desired sum is

   2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2183 + 2184  =  12166.
