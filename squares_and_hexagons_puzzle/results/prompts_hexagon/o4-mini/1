First, one shows that “2026” lies in the 26th hex‐ring (the centre “1” is ring 0), and that within that ring its position index is  
   i = 2026 − M(25) − 1 = 2026 − 1951 − 1 = 74,  
where M(k)=1+3k(k+1) is the maximum number in ring k.  Thus k=26 and i=74 (0≤i<6·26=156).

We then use the standard “corner+side‐offset” model of the hex‐spiral.  In axial coordinates the six corners of ring k are at

   C₀=(k,0), C₁=(k,−k), C₂=(0,−k), C₃=(−k,0), C₄=(−k,k), C₅=(0,k),

and each side s=0,…,5 is the segment from C_s to C_{s+1} (with C₆≡C₀), parameterized by a side‐direction vector.  One finds that ring 26 index i=74 sits on side s=⌊74/26⌋=2 with offset t=74−2·26=22, so its coordinate is

   (x,y) = C₂ + 22·(−1,1) = (0,−26)+(−22,22) = (−22,−4).

Its six neighbours lie one step away in the six hex‐directions.  Checking their ring–indices shows exactly two lie in ring 25, two in ring 26 itself (namely 2025 and 2027) and two in ring 27.  In fact one computes

   inner neighbours  = ring 25, indices 71 & 72 ⇒ numbers 1873 & 1874,
   same–ring neighbours = 2025 & 2027,
   outer neighbours  = ring 27, indices 76 & 77 ⇒ numbers 2184 & 2185.

Hence the sum of all six neighbours of 2026 is

   1873+1874 + 2025+2027 + 2184+2185 = 12168.
