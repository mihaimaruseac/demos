First one shows that 2026 sits on the 26th “hex‐ring’’ (which runs from 1952 up to 2107).  Writing its offset around that ring as j=2026−1952=74 (so 0≤j<6·26), one finds its two neighbours on the same ring are at j±1, its two neighbours inward lie on ring 25 at indices ⌈74/26⌉·25+(74 mod 26)−1 and +0, and its two neighbours outward lie on ring 27 at indices ⌈74/26⌉·27+(74 mod 26) and +1.  Converting back to actual values gives the six neighbours

 2025, 2027  (same ring)  
 1873, 1874  (inner ring)  
 2184, 2185  (outer ring)

and their sum is  

 2025+2027+1873+1874+2184+2185 = 12168.
