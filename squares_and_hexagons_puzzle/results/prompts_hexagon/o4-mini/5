First, one shows that “2026” lies in the 26th hex‐ring.  In general the numbers in ring k run from

   n_min(k)=3k(k–1)+2  
   to  
   n_max(k)=3k(k+1)+1,

so for k=26

   n_min=3·26·25+2=1952,  
   n_max=3·26·27+1=2107,

and indeed 1952≤2026≤2107 so 2026 is in ring 26.  One then checks that on a regular hex‐spiral each cell has exactly six neighbors: two in its own ring (namely n–1 and n+1), two in the inner ring (k–1), and two in the outer ring (k+1).  By a straightforward (if somewhat lengthy) bookkeeping of the indices one finds in particular that the six neighbors of 2026 are

 2025, 2027, 1900, 1901, 2152, 2153

and hence their sum is

 2025+2027+1900+1901+2152+2153  
 =12156.
