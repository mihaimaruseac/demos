Label the “spiral‐coordinates’’ so that 1 sits at (0,0), its six first neighbours are at   
(0,1),(−1,0),(−1,−1),(0,−1),(1,−1),(1,0)   
and the spiral is generated by walking one step in each of those six directions on layer 1, then two steps in each on layer 2, three in each on layer 3, etc.  One checks that  
2026 sits out on layer 26, at “segment’’ s = 2 (of the six), with “offset’’ t = 22 along that segment.  
Hence its six neighbours turn out to be  
  2025, 2027       (the two adjacent points on the same 26th ring)  
  1873, 1874       (the two neighbours one step inwards on the 25th ring)  
  2184, 2185       (the two neighbours one step outwards on the 27th ring)  

and their sum is  
2025+2027 + 1873+1874 + 2184+2185 = 12168.
