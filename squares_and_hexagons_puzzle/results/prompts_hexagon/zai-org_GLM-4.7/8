The natural numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid in a clockwise spiral starting from the center. Using axial coordinates, the number 2026 is located at coordinates \((3,-26)\) with ring \(k=26\). The six neighbors and their numbers are:

- East \((4,-26)\): 2025  
- Southeast \((3,-25)\): 1873  
- Southwest \((2,-25)\): 1874  
- West \((2,-26)\): 2027  
- Northwest \((3,-27)\): 2185  
- Northeast \((4,-27)\): 2184  

Their sum is  
\[
2025 + 1873 + 1874 + 2027 + 2185 + 2184 = 12168.
\]

Thus the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{12168}\).
