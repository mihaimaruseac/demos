The natural numbers are placed on a hexagonal spiral on a hexagonal grid. By analyzing the given sample, the coordinates of each number can be determined. The coordinate system uses axial coordinates \((q, r)\) with the six neighbor directions: \(E=(1,0)\), \(W=(-1,0)\), \(NE=(0,1)\), \(NW=(-1,1)\), \(SE=(1,-1)\), \(SW=(0,-1)\). The center \(1\) is at \((0,0)\).

The spiral visits each ring \(d\ge 1\) (where \(d\) is the hex distance from the center) in counter‑clockwise order, starting at the cell \(S(d) = (d, -d+1)\). The cells in ring \(d\) are enumerated by an index \(k = 0,1,\dots,6d-1\). The mapping from \(k\) to coordinates is obtained by first computing \(\text{idx} = (k+1) \bmod (6d)\) (with \(\text{idx}=0\) corresponding to the corner \((d,-d)\)), then determining the edge \(e = \lfloor \text{idx}/d \rfloor\) and the position \(t = \text{idx} - e d\) on that edge. The coordinates are given by:

- Edge \(0\) (from \((d,-d)\) to \((d,0)\)): \((d,\; -d+t)\)
- Edge \(1\) (from \((d,0)\) to \((0,d)\)): \((d-t,\; t)\)
- Edge \(2\) (from \((0,d)\) to \((-d,d)\)): \((-t,\; d)\)
- Edge \(3\) (from \((-d,d)\) to \((-d,0)\)): \((-d,\; d-t)\)
- Edge \(4\) (from \((-d,0)\) to \((0,-d)\)): \((-d+t,\; -t)\)
- Edge \(5\) (from \((0,-d)\) to \((d,-d)\)): \((t,\; -d)\)

The number assigned to a cell in ring \(d\) with index \(k\) is
\[
n = N_{\text{start}}(d) + k,\qquad N_{\text{start}}(d) = 3d(d-1)+2.
\]

For \(2026\), the ring is \(d = 26\) and the index is \(k = 74\). Its coordinates are \((-23,26)\). The six neighbors and their numbers are:

- \(E\): \((-22,26)\) → \(2025\)
- \(W\): \((-24,26)\) → \(2027\)
- \(NE\): \((-23,27)\) → \(2184\)
- \(NW\): \((-24,27)\) → \(2185\)
- \(SW\): \((-23,25)\) → \(1874\)
- \(SE\): \((-22,25)\) → \(1873\)

The sum of these six numbers is
\[
2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
\]

\boxed{12168}
