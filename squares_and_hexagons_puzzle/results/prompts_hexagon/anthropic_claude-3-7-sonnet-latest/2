I need to find the numbers adjacent to 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and sum them.

In this hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. The spiral starts with 1 at the center, then spirals outward following a specific pattern.

Let me analyze how numbers are placed on this spiral:
- 1 is at the center
- 2-7 form the first ring (6 numbers)
- 8-19 form the second ring (12 numbers)
- Each subsequent ring has 6 more numbers than the previous ring

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine:
1. Which ring 2026 is in
2. Its position within that ring
3. The numbers adjacent to it

Let me calculate which ring contains 2026:
Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
...

The formula for the last number in ring n is: 1 + 3n(n+1)

Solving for 2026:
1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula:
n ≈ 26.0

So 2026 is in ring 26.

The first number in ring 26 is: 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951
The last number in ring 26 is: 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107

Within each ring, numbers increase consecutively, and 2026 is the (2026-1951+1) = 76th number in ring 26.

The neighbors of 2026 include:
1. The number before it in the same ring: 2025
2. The number after it in the same ring: 2027
3. Two numbers from the inner ring (ring 25)
4. Two numbers from the outer ring (ring 27)

Based on the spiral structure and 2026's position, its six neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 1913, 1914, 2107, 2108

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 2027 + 1913 + 1914 + 2107 + 2108 = 12094
