# Finding the Sum of Neighbors of 2026 on a Hexagonal Spiral

I need to determine the 6 neighbors of 2026 in a hexagonal spiral and find their sum.

First, I'll understand the pattern of the hexagonal spiral. From the example:
- 1 is at the center
- The numbers spiral outward: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
- Each number has 6 neighbors on the hexagonal grid

To solve this problem, I need to:
1. Find the position (layer and sector) of 2026 in the spiral
2. Determine its 6 neighbors
3. Sum those neighbors

## Analyzing the Hexagonal Spiral Pattern

In a hexagonal spiral:
- Layer 0: Contains just 1
- Layer 1: Contains numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 2: Contains numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Layer n: Contains 6n numbers

The first number in layer n is: 1 + 3n(n-1) + 1 = 3n² - 3n + 1

## Finding the Layer of 2026

I need to find n where:
3n² - 3n + 1 ≤ 2026 < 3(n+1)² - 3(n+1) + 1

Solving: 3n² - 3n + 1 ≤ 2026
3n² - 3n - 2025 ≤ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≈ 26.04
So 2026 is in layer 26.

## Finding the Neighbors

In layer 26, the first number is 3(26)² - 3(26) + 1 = 2029 - 78 + 1 = 1952.
The last number in layer 26 is 1952 + 6(26) - 1 = 1952 + 156 - 1 = 2107.

However, 2026 doesn't fall in this range. Let me recalculate:

For layer 25: First number = 3(25)² - 3(25) + 1 = 1875 - 75 + 1 = 1801
Last number = 1801 + 6(25) - 1 = 1801 + 150 - 1 = 1950

For layer 26: First number = 3(26)² - 3(26) + 1 = 2029 - 78 + 1 = 1952
Last number = 1952 + 6(26) - 1 = 1952 + 156 - 1 = 2107

So 2026 is in layer 26, and is the (2026-1952+1) = 75th number in this layer.

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Two neighbors from the same layer: 2025 and 2027
- One neighbor from layer 27: 2026 + (layer size) = 2026 + 156 = 2182
- Three neighbors from layer 25: These would be around position 75 in layer 25

Looking at exact positions, the neighbors are:
1. 2025 (same layer, previous number)
2. 2027 (same layer, next number)
3. 2182 (outer layer)
4. 1950 (inner layer)
5. 1951 (inner layer)
6. 2183 (outer layer)

The sum of all 6 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 2182 + 1950 + 1951 + 2183 = 12,318
