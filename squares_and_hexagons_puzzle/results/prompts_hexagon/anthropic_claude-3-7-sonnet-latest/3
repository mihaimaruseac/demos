# Finding the Sum of Neighbors of 2026 on a Hexagonal Spiral Grid

I need to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid where numbers are arranged in a specific spiral pattern.

First, I'll analyze the pattern from the example:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form the first ring
- 8, 9, 10, ..., 19 form the second ring
- And so on...

## Pattern Analysis
Each hexagonal ring k contains 6k cells. So:
- Ring 0 (center): 1 cell (number 1)
- Ring 1: 6 cells (numbers 2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 cells (numbers 8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 cells (numbers 20-37)
- And so on...

## Finding the Ring of 2026
To determine which ring contains 2026, I need to solve:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + 6(3) + ... + 6(n-1) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n)
1 + 6(1+2+3+...+(n-1)) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 6(1+2+3+...+n)
1 + 6(n-1)n/2 < 2026 ≤ 1 + 6n(n+1)/2
1 + 3(n-1)n < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3n(n+1)

Solving this inequality: n = 26
Ring 26 contains 2026, with the ring starting at 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1951 and ending at 1 + 3(26)(27) = 2107

## Position within Ring 26
2026 is at position (2026 - 1951) = 75 within ring 26.

## Identifying Neighbors
In a hexagonal grid, a number has:
- Two neighbors in its own ring (except at corners)
- One neighbor in the previous ring
- One neighbor in the next ring
- Two neighbors at the ring junctions

The 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
1. 2025 (previous number in same ring)
2. 2027 (next number in same ring)
3. 1886 (corresponding position in previous ring)
4. 2172 (corresponding position in next ring)
5. 1885 (junction with previous ring)
6. 2171 (junction with next ring)

## Sum of Neighbors
1885 + 1886 + 2025 + 2027 + 2171 + 2172 = 12,166

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 12,166.
