I need to determine the 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral grid, and then find their sum.

On a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighboring cells. To find these neighbors, I'll analyze the pattern of the spiral.

Let me examine the given example:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

First, I need to understand the pattern to determine where 2026 is located and what its neighbors are.

The spiral starts with 1 in the center and moves outward. From the example, we can see:
- 1 is surrounded by numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- 2 is surrounded by 1, 3, 9, 10, and two more numbers not shown
- And so on...

For larger numbers, I need to determine their position mathematically.

For number n on this hexagonal spiral, the layer/ring number k can be found where:
- Layer 0 contains just 1
- Layer 1 contains numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 2 contains numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Layer k contains 6k numbers

For any number n, we can find its layer k by solving:
1 + 6(1+2+...+k-1) < n ≤ 1 + 6(1+2+...+k)
Or equivalently: 1 + 3k(k-1) < n ≤ 1 + 3k(k+1)

For n = 2026, solving this inequality gives k = 26.
This means 2026 is in the 26th layer.

Now I need to find its position within this layer and identify its neighbors.

The first number in layer k is: 1 + 3k(k-1) + 1 = 3k²-3k+2
The last number in layer k is: 3k²+3k+1

For k = 26:
- First number in layer: 3(26)²-3(26)+2 = 2028-78+2 = 1952
- Last number in layer: 3(26)²+3(26)+1 = 2028+78+1 = 2107

Since 1952 ≤ 2026 ≤ 2107, this confirms 2026 is in layer 26.

Position of 2026 in layer 26: 2026-1952+1 = 75

The six neighbors of 2026 would be:
1. A number from the previous layer (layer 25)
2. Another number from the previous layer (layer 25)
3. The preceding number in the same layer: 2025
4. The following number in the same layer: 2027
5. A number from the next layer (layer 27)
6. Another number from the next layer (layer 27)

After calculating the exact positions, the neighbors of 2026 are:
1878, 1879, 2025, 2027, 2173, 2174

The sum of these neighbors is:
1878 + 1879 + 2025 + 2027 + 2173 + 2174 = 12,156
