# Finding the Sum of Neighbors of 2026 on a Hexagonal Spiral Grid

I need to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in a hexagonal grid where numbers spiral outward from 1.

## Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral Pattern

Let me analyze how numbers are arranged in this spiral:
- 1 is at the center
- Numbers spiral outward: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
- The pattern forms hexagonal "layers" or "rings" around the center

## Determining the Layer of 2026

To find the neighbors of 2026, I first need to determine which hexagonal layer it belongs to.

Each complete hexagonal layer contains 6n numbers, where n is the layer number:
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- And so on...

The last number in layer n is: 1 + 3n(n+1)

Through calculation, I find that 2026 is in layer 26, and specifically at position 6 (the last position) in that layer.

## Finding the Neighbors

For a number at the end of a layer, the 6 neighbors are:
1. The previous number in the same layer: 2025
2. The next number (first in next layer): 2027
3. The number at the end of the previous layer: 1977
4. Two consecutive numbers from the next layer: 2028 and 2029
5. One number from the same position in the previous layer: 1926

## Calculating the Sum

The sum of neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 2027 + 1977 + 2028 + 2029 + 1926 = 12,012

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 on this hexagonal spiral grid is 12,012.
