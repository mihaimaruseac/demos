# Finding the Sum of Neighbors of 2026 on a Hexagonal Spiral

I need to find the 6 neighbors of 2026 on this hexagonal spiral and sum them.

First, I need to understand the pattern of the spiral. Looking at the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

I can see that from 1, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Down-right to 7
- Down-left to 6
- Left to 5
- Up-left to 4
- Up-right to 3
- And continues outward following this hexagonal pattern

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to identify its position in the spiral and then determine the 6 surrounding numbers.

The hexagonal spiral follows a pattern where each "layer" contains more numbers than the previous. Let me analyze this structure:
- Layer 0: Just 1 (center)
- Layer 1: Numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 2: Numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Layer 3: Numbers 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Layer n: Contains 6n numbers

To find which layer contains 2026, I need to solve:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) ≥ 2026

This simplifies to:
1 + 6(n(n+1)/2) ≥ 2026
1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026

Solving: n ≈ 25.96, so 2026 is in layer 26.

The first number in layer 26 is 1 + 6(1+2+...+25) = 1 + 6(25×26/2) = 1 + 6(325) = 1 + 1950 = 1951.
The last number in layer 26 is 1950 + 1951 - 1 = 3900.

So 2026 is positioned 2026 - 1951 = 75 steps into layer 26.

Each side of the hexagon in layer 26 has 26 numbers. Since 75 = 2×26 + 23, 2026 is on the 3rd side, 23 positions in.

The neighbors of 2026 would be:
- 2025 (previous in the spiral)
- 2027 (next in the spiral)
- The number in the previous layer (layer 25)
- The number in the next layer (layer 27)
- And two more adjacent numbers

Calculating precisely, the 6 neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 1700, 1701, 2377, 2376

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 2027 + 1700 + 1701 + 2377 + 2376 = 12,206
