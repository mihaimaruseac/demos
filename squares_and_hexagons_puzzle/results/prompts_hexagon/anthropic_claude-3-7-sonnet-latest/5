I need to determine the 6 neighbors of 2026 on a hexagonal grid spiral and find their sum.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has 6 neighbors. Let me analyze the pattern of this spiral:

Starting from 1 in the center:
- The first ring contains numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- The second ring contains numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- The third ring contains numbers 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Each subsequent ring k contains 6k numbers

To find where 2026 is located and determine its neighbors, I'll:
1) Determine which ring 2026 is in
2) Find its position within that ring
3) Identify all 6 adjacent numbers

Step 1: Finding the ring number
Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
...
Ring k: 6k numbers

The sum of numbers in rings 1 through k is: 6(1+2+...+k) = 6k(k+1)/2 = 3k(k+1)

I need to find k such that: 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026 > 3(k-1)k

Solving 3k(k+1) = 2026:
3k² + 3k = 2026
k² + k = 2026/3
k² + k - 2026/3 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
k = (-1 + √(1 + 4×2026/3))/2
k = (-1 + √(8105/3))/2
k = (-1 + √2701.67)/2
k ≈ (-1 + 51.98)/2
k ≈ 25.49

So 2026 is in ring 26, and the last number in ring 25 is 3×25×26 = 1950.

Step 2: Finding 2026's position in ring 26
2026 is the (2026-1950) = 76th number in ring 26.
Each ring has 6 sides with the kth ring having k numbers on each side.
Ring 26 has 26 numbers on each side (total 156 numbers).

Step 3: Determining the neighbors
On a hexagonal spiral, the 6 neighbors of a number include:
- The previous and next numbers in the same ring
- Two numbers from the inner ring
- Two numbers from the outer ring

For 2026, which is the 76th number in ring 26:
- Same ring neighbors: 2025 and 2027
- Inner ring neighbors (ring 25): These would be around positions corresponding to 76th position in ring 26
- Outer ring neighbors (ring 27): These would be around positions corresponding to 76th position in ring 26

After analyzing the pattern geometry, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 and 2027 (same ring)
- 1949 and 1950 (inner ring)
- 2106 and 2107 (outer ring)

The sum of all 6 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 1949 + 1950 + 2106 + 2107 = 12,164
