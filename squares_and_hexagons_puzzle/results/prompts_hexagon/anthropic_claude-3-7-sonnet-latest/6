I need to find the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the hexagonal spiral and calculate their sum.

First, I'll understand the pattern of the spiral. From the example given:
- 1 is at the center
- Numbers spiral outward: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
- Each number has 6 neighbors in a hexagonal grid

The spiral appears to go: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 and so on.

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine its position in the spiral and then identify its adjacent numbers.

In a hexagonal spiral, numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal "rings" around the center:
- Ring 0: only number 1
- Ring 1: numbers 2-7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 20-37 (18 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 6n numbers, from (3n²-3n+2) to (3n²+3n+1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026 by solving the inequality:
3n²-3n+2 ≤ 2026 ≤ 3n²+3n+1

Solving 3n²-3n+2 = 2026:
3n²-3n-2024 = 0
n ≈ 26.06

Solving 3n²+3n+1 = 2026:
3n²+3n-2025 = 0
n ≈ 25.94

Since n must be a whole number and 2026 falls between these values, 2026 is in ring 26.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 "sides", and knowing the position along a side helps identify neighbors. The neighbors of 2026 would include:
- The number before it in the spiral (2025)
- The number after it in the spiral (2027)
- Numbers from the ring inside (ring 25)
- Numbers from the ring outside (ring 27)

Based on the hexagonal spiral pattern, the six neighbors of 2026 would be:
2025, 2027, 1874, 1875, 2184, 2183

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1875 + 2184 + 2183 = 12,168
