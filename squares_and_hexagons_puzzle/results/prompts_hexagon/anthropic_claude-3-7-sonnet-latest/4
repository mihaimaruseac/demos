I need to determine the 6 neighboring cells of the number 2026 on the hexagonal spiral grid, and then find their sum.

First, I'll understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the example:
- 1 is at the center
- Numbers increase as we spiral outward: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
- Each number has 6 neighbors on the hexagonal grid

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine:
1. What "layer" or "ring" of the spiral contains 2026
2. Where in that ring 2026 is positioned
3. Then identify its 6 neighbors

Let me analyze how numbers are distributed in the hexagonal spiral:
- Layer 0: only contains 1 (center)
- Layer 1: contains 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 2: contains 8-19 (12 numbers)
- Layer 3: contains 20-37 (18 numbers)

I notice that layer n contains 6n numbers.

To find which layer contains 2026:
The last number in layer n is 1 + 6(1+2+...+n) = 1 + 6(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Let me solve for n where:
1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Solving this quadratic inequality:
n ≥ (-3 + √(12101))/6 ≈ 26.04

So 2026 is in layer 27 (since we need the smallest integer n that satisfies the inequality).

The first number in layer 27 is 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107
The last number in layer 27 is 1 + 3(27)(28) = 1 + 2268 = 2269

So 2026 is in layer 26, with 2026 - (1 + 3(25)(26)) = 2026 - 1951 = 75 positions into this layer.

Now I can determine the neighbors of 2026:
- One neighbor is from the same layer but adjacent position: 2025 and 2027
- One neighbor is from the previous layer (layer 25): around position 75 in that layer
- One neighbor is from the next layer (layer 27): around position 75 in that layer
- The other three neighbors can be found by considering the hexagonal geometry

Based on the pattern of the hexagonal spiral, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 1951, 1952, 2101, 2102

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 2027 + 1951 + 1952 + 2101 + 2102 = 12,158
