A concise way to arrive at the answer is to track which “ring” in the hex‐spiral 2026 lies on and then use the fact that each hex‐cell in ring r has exactly:

• two neighbors in the same ring r (the immediately preceding and following numbers),  
• two neighbors in the inner ring r − 1 (at nearly the “same” angular position),  
• two neighbors in the outer ring r + 1 (again at nearly the same angular position).

Once one knows how the rings are laid out and how the numbering proceeds around each ring, one can systematically identify those six neighbors.  Below is an outline of the reasoning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1)  Identifying which ring 2026 is on
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In a standard hex spiral, ring 0 is just the center cell n = 1.  Ring 1 has the next 6 numbers (2 through 7), ring 2 has the next 12 numbers (8 through 19), ring 3 has the next 18 numbers (20 through 37), and in general ring r has 6r numbers.  The largest number in ring r is

  M(r) = 1 + 6 + 12 + … + 6r  =  1 + 3r(r + 1).

Hence  
  M(r) = 3r(r + 1) + 1.

We want r so that M(r − 1) < 2026 ≤ M(r).  
One checks that  
  M(25) = 3·25·26 + 1 = 1951,  
  M(26) = 3·26·27 + 1 = 2107.  
Since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107, the number 2026 lies in ring 26.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2)  The numbering around ring 26
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ring 26 contains the numbers 1952 through 2107 (that is 6 × 26 = 156 numbers).  They are laid out in “six sides” of length 26 each.  Label them in ascending order:

• Side 1: 1952, 1953, …, 1977  (26 numbers)  
• Side 2: 1978, 1979, …, 2003  (26 numbers)  
• Side 3: 2004, 2005, …, 2029  (26 numbers)  
• Side 4: 2030, …, 2055  
• Side 5: 2056, …, 2081  
• Side 6: 2082, …, 2107  

Counting how far 2026 sits into ring 26 shows that it is the 23rd number on Side 3 (since Side 1 and Side 2 together account for 52 numbers, then 2026 is number 75 in the ring, i.e. 23rd along Side 3).

Inside a regular hex grid, each cell on ring r has two neighbors on the same ring (the previous and next along that ring), two neighbors on ring r − 1, and two on ring r + 1.  Concretely:

• In ring 26 itself, 2026 is adjacent to 2025 and 2027.  
• On the inside (ring 25), the cell “under” the 23rd position on side 3 of ring 26 aligns with (roughly) the 22nd and 23rd positions on side 3 of ring 25.  A short check shows those are 1873 and 1874.  
• On the outside (ring 27), the corresponding neighbors turn out to be the 23rd and 24th slots on the matching side 3 of ring 27, namely 2182 and 2183.

Hence the six neighbors of 2026 are

  2025, 2027   (same ring)  
  1873, 1874   (inner ring)  
  2182, 2183   (outer ring).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3)  Summing those neighbors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Their sum is

  (2025 + 2027) + (1873 + 1874) + (2182 + 2183)  
  = 4052 + 3747 + 4365  
  = 12164.

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 in the hex spiral is 12164.
