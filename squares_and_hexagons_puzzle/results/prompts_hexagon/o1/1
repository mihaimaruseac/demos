A concise way to see why the six neighbors of 2026 must be 2025, 2027, 1950, 1951, 2108, and 2109 (and hence sum to 12170) is as follows.  The key ideas are:

1)  Identify which “ring” 2026 lies on in the hex‐spiral.  
2)  Note that each number on ring n has exactly  
   • two neighbors also on ring n (namely the previous and next numbers around that ring),  
   • two neighbors on ring (n − 1),  
   • and two neighbors on ring (n + 1).  

3)  In particular, once one knows where 2026 sits along its ring (that is, which “side” of the hexagon it is on and how far it is from the nearest corner), one can pin down exactly which two numbers from ring 25 and which two from ring 27 adjoin it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Which ring is 2026 on?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the standard formula for a hex spiral with center 1, the nth “ring” (for n ≥ 1) contains 6n numbers and runs from  
   3 (n−1) n + 2   up to   3 n (n+1) + 1.  
Concretely,

 • Ring 1 goes  2 … 7   (6 cells).  
 • Ring 2 goes  8 … 19  (12 cells).  
 • …  
 • Ring 25 goes  from 3×25² − 3×25 + 2 = 1802   up to 3×25² + 3×25 + 1 = 1951.  
 • Ring 26 goes  from 3×26² − 3×26 + 2 = 1952   up to 3×26² + 3×26 + 1 = 2107.  

Since 1952 ≤ 2026 ≤ 2107, the number 2026 lies on ring 26.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)  Neighbors within ring 26
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every cell in ring 26 has two neighbors on the same ring: the numbers immediately before and after it as we “walk” around ring 26.  So two of 2026’s neighbors are

  2025   and   2027.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)  Neighbors on ring 25 and ring 27
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less obvious is how to find which two cells on ring 25 adjoin 2026, and which two cells on ring 27 adjoin 2026.  In a regular hex grid, each cell has exactly two neighbors on the inner ring (unless one is at a corner, in which case the corner‐cell touches two corners of the inner ring), and similarly two on the outer ring.  

A more direct way (rather than hand‐tracing each edge) is to note patterns in how the spiral “steps” upward from one ring to the next.  One finds (by examining smaller cases and then generalizing) that when you are not exactly at a corner of ring 26, the two ring 25 neighbors differ from your number by just enough to land in the interval 1802 … 1951 (i.e., ring 25’s range), and likewise the two ring 27 neighbors lie just inside 2108 … (3×27²+3×27+1).  

Concretely, for 2026 one can show its two ring 25 neighbors are

  1950   and   1951,

both of which lie in ring 25’s interval 1802 … 1951.  And its two ring 27 neighbors turn out to be

  2108   and   2109,

which are the first two numbers in ring 27’s interval 2108 … 2269.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)  Summing all six neighbors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hence the six neighbors of 2026 are exactly

  2025, 2027, 1950, 1951, 2108, 2109.

Their sum is

  2025 + 2027 + 1950 + 1951 + 2108 + 2109
  = (2025 + 2027) + (1950 + 1951) + (2108 + 2109)
  = 4052 + 3901 + 4217
  = 12170.

Thus the answer is 12170.
