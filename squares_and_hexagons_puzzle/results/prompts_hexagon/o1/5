A concise way to see why the answer is 12 168 is as follows.  In a regular “hex‐spiral” layout, every number n in ring k (for k≥1) has:

• two neighbors in the same ring k (the “previous” and “next” along that hexagonal loop),  
• two neighbors in the inner ring k−1 (unless n is exactly a corner, in which case it has only one), and  
• two neighbors in the outer ring k+1 (again, two unless it sits on a corner).  

Once one knows which ring 2026 lies in and how far it is from the nearest corners, one can track down exactly which numbers lie “inward” and “outward.”  The final tally is:

1) Its two neighbors in the same ring (ring 26):  
   – 2025 and 2027.  

2) Its two inward neighbors in ring 25:  
   – 1874 and 1873.  

3) Its two outward neighbors in ring 27:  
   – 2185 and 2184.  

Adding these six neighbors gives  
   2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2185 + 2184 = 12 168.  

Hence, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12 168.
