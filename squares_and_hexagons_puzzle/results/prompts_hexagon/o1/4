A concise way to see why the answer is 12 168 is to place each natural number in “axial” coordinates for a hex–grid and then track how the spiral is generated ring by ring.  The key steps are:

1) Determine which “ring” 2026 lies on.  
   • The center (ring 0) is the single cell 1.  
   • Ring 1 has numbers 2 through 7, ring 2 has 8 through 19, and in general ring n goes from  
     3 (n − 1) n + 2  up to  3 n (n + 1) + 1.  
   • One finds that 2026 lies on ring 26, whose numbers run from 1952 up to 2107.

2) Assign coordinates to each cell.  
   A convenient system is to let (0, 0) be the cell “1” in the center, and write each hex cell in so‑called axial coordinates (x, y).  The condition for lying on ring n is  
     max( |x|, |y|, |x + y| )  =  n.  

   One can show that ring n may be traversed by starting at (0, −n) and walking 6 “straight” segments (each of length n) around the hexagon.  In other words, one enumerates i from 0 up to 6n − 1, and moves in directions  
     (1, 0) → (0, 1) → (−1, 1) → (−1, 0) → (0, −1) → (1, −1)  
   each for n steps.

3) Locate the coordinates of 2026 on ring 26.  
   • Ring 26 starts at label 1952 (i = 0) in coordinates (0, −26).  
   • It ends at label 2107 (i = 155) after 156 steps.  
   • Since 2026 is the (2026 − 1952) = 74th cell in that ring, we set i = 74.  
   • One finds that for i = 0..25 we move in direction (1, 0), for i = 26..51 we move in (0, 1), for i = 52..77 we move in (−1, 1), etc.  
   • Because 74 lies in the third segment (i = 52..77) which is direction (−1, 1), one deduces the coordinates of 2026 are (4, 22).

4) Compute the neighbors’ coordinates.  
   In a hex grid, the six neighbors of (x, y) in axial coordinates are  
     (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x−1, y+1),  
     (x−1, y), (x, y−1), (x+1, y−1).  

   For (4, 22), these six neighbors are  
     (5, 22), (4, 23), (3, 23), (3, 22), (4, 21), (5, 21).  

5) Determine which rings those neighbors lie on and what their labels are.  
   • Check max(|x|, |y|, |x + y|) to find the ring.  
   • Then use the same “walk around the ring” method to see which step i corresponds to each coordinate.  
   One finds:  
   – (5, 22)  and  (4, 23)   lie on ring 27,  with labels 2184 and 2185.  
   – (3, 23)  and  (5, 21)   lie on ring 26,  with labels 2027 and 2025.  
   – (3, 22)  and  (4, 21)   lie on ring 25,  with labels 1874 and 1873.  

6) Sum those six neighbors:
      1873  +  1874  +  2025  +  2027  +  2184  +  2185  
    = 12 168.

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 in the hex–spiral is 12 168.
