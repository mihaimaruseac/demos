A concise way to see why the answer is 12 166 is as follows.  In a standard “hex‐spiral” labeling, each natural number n (beyond 1) lies on some ring k around the center 1, where ring k consists of the numbers

  3k(k−1) + 2,  3k(k−1) + 3,  …,  3k(k+1) + 1

and contains exactly 6k consecutive integers.  One can parametrize each number on ring k by a “side” s (from 0 to 5) and a “step” t along that side (from 0 up to k).  

Step 1: Identify the ring and side/step of 2026.  
• First check which ring 2026 belongs to.  The largest number on ring k is 3k(k+1)+1.  
  Solve 3k(k+1)+1 ≥ 2026.  
  One finds k = 26 is the smallest that satisfies this, so 2026 lies on ring 26.

• The southwestern corner of ring 26 is at  
  corner₀ = 3·26·(26−1) + 2 = 3·26·25 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952.  
  Each ring has six “corners,” spaced by +26 each time.  The corner we call corner₂ is  
  corner₂ = corner₀ + 2×26 = 1952 + 52 = 2004.  
  Along side 2, the numbers go from 2004 (step 0) up to 2030 (step 26).  
  Hence 2026 is step t = 2026 − 2004 = 22 along side 2 of ring 26.

Step 2: Use the standard hex‐grid neighbor rule in (ring, side, step) form.  
If 0 < t < k, a cell on ring k, side s, step t has these six neighbors:

1) (k, s, t−1),     2) (k, s, t+1)            [the two neighbors on the same ring],  
3) (k−1, s, t−1),   4) (k−1, s, t)            [the two “inner” neighbors],  
5) (k+1, s, t−1),   6) (k+1, s, t)            [the two “outer” neighbors],

with the understanding that if t−1 < 0 or t+1 > k one must wrap to an adjacent side.  
Since 2026 has 0 < t=22 < 26, we apply that formula directly:

• Neighbors on the same ring 26:  
  (26, 2, 21) ⇒ 2004 + 21 = 2025,  
  (26, 2, 23) ⇒ 2004 + 23 = 2027.

• Inner neighbors (ring 25):  
  First find ring 25’s corner₂:  
    corner₀(25) = 3·25·24 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802,  
    corner₂(25) = 1802 + 2×25 = 1802 + 50 = 1852.  
  Then  
    (25, 2, 21) ⇒ 1852 + 21 = 1873,  
    (25, 2, 22) ⇒ 1852 + 22 = 1874.

• Outer neighbors (ring 27):  
  Similarly, ring 27’s corner₂ is  
    corner₀(27) = 3·27·26 + 2 = 2106 + 2 = 2108,  
    corner₂(27) = 2108 + 2×27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162.  
  Hence  
    (27, 2, 21) ⇒ 2162 + 21 = 2183,  
    (27, 2, 22) ⇒ 2162 + 22 = 2184.

Step 3: Sum these six neighbors.  
  2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2183 + 2184 = 12 166.

Therefore, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 on the hex spiral is 12,166.
