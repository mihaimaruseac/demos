## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid. To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to identify its position in this spiral.

## Step 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
Since the spiral is not explicitly defined, we'll assume it starts with 1 and increases in a clockwise direction, with each row containing one more number than the last. The pattern given shows that the numbers increase by 1 as we move right or down in the grid.

## Step 3: Determine the row and column of 2026
Given the pattern, the first row has 3 numbers, the second row has 5 numbers, and so on. The third row has 7 numbers. We need to find out which row and column 2026 falls into. However, without a clear pattern for the row number, we'll have to consider the given numbers and deduce the pattern.

## Step 4: Analyze the given numbers to deduce the pattern
Looking at the given numbers, we can observe that the first number of each row increases by 1 (14, 15, 16), and the number of columns in each row also increases by 2 (3, 5, 7). This pattern suggests that the nth row will have n+2 numbers.

## Step 5: Determine the row and column of 2026
Given that 2026 is a 4-digit number, and considering the pattern of increasing numbers, we can deduce that 2026 is likely in the 8th row, as the 7th row would contain numbers around 16 to 20, and 2026 is greater than 20.

## Step 6: Calculate the exact position of 2026 in the spiral
Since the pattern increases by 1 as we move right or down, and considering the number of columns in each row increases by 2, we can deduce that 2026 is in the 8th row, 3rd column (as the first row has 3 numbers, the second row has 5, and the third row has 7, so the 8th row will have 11 numbers, with the first 3 being 2023, 2024, and 2025).

## Step 7: Identify the 6 neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 would be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally above-left, above-right, below-left, and below-right.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
However, we can simplify this step by recognizing that the sum of the neighbors of any number in the spiral will be the sum of the numbers in the same row or column plus the numbers in the diagonally adjacent rows or columns.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the row or column of 2026
Since 2026 is in the 8th row, we need to find the sum of the numbers in the 8th row. However, we realize that we don't have enough information about the exact numbers around 2026, so we'll need to adjust our approach.

## Step 10: Re-evaluate the approach
Given the lack of information about the exact numbers around 2026, we need to reconsider our approach. We should focus on the pattern of the numbers and the properties of the spiral to find the sum of the neighbors.

## Step 11: Use the properties of the spiral to find the sum of the neighbors
Since the spiral is a circular arrangement, the sum of the neighbors of any number is equal to the sum of the numbers in the same row or column plus the numbers in the diagonally adjacent rows or columns.

## Step 12: Apply the properties of the spiral to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026
However, we realize that we don't have enough information to calculate the sum of the neighbors directly. We need to find a different approach.

The spiral has a symmetrical property, where the sum of the numbers in the same row or column is equal to the sum of the numbers in the diagonally adjacent rows or columns.

## Step 14: Use the symmetry to find the sum of the neighbors
Since 2026 is in the 8th row, we can find the sum of the numbers in the same row or column by counting the numbers in the row or column and multiplying it by the value of the first number in the row or column.
