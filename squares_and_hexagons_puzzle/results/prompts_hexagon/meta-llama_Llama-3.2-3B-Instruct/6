## Step 1:  Identify the pattern and structure of the spiral grid.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid. Each row and column has a specific pattern of numbers.

## Step 2:  Determine the position of the number 2026 in the grid.
Since the pattern is a spiral and the numbers increase as we move outward, we can determine the row and column of 2026 by examining the pattern.

## Step 3:  Recognize that the spiral starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction.
The numbers in the first row are 3, 4, 10, and so on. The second row has 1, 2, 9, and so on. The third row has 7, 8, 16, and so on.

## Step 4:  Identify the row and column of 2026.
By analyzing the pattern, we can see that the number 2026 is in the 6th row (counting from the center), and its column can be determined by the pattern of the numbers.

## Step 5:  Determine the neighbors of 2026.
Since 2026 is in the 6th row, its neighbors are the numbers in the 5th and 7th rows.

## Step 6:  Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
To find the sum, we need to find the numbers in the 5th and 7th rows that are directly above and below 2026.

## Step 7:  Identify the numbers in the 5th and 7th rows.
The 5th row is 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and the 7th row is 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.

## Step 8:  Calculate the sum of the neighbors.
The sum of the neighbors is 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36.

## Step 9:  Perform the addition.
16 + 17 = 33, 33 + 18 = 51, 51 + 19 = 70, 70 + 20 = 90, 90 + 32 = 122, 122 + 33 = 155, 155 + 34 = 189, 189 + 35 = 224, 224 + 36 = 260.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$
