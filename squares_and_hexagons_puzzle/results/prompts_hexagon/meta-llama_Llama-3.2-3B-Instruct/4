## Step 1: Identify the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a hexagonal grid, and the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern. We need to understand the layout to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

## Step 2: Locate the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
Since the spiral is made up of concentric hexagons, we can start by identifying the central number in each hexagon. The central number in each hexagon is a multiple of 6 (6, 12, 18, ...). We can see that 2026 is not a multiple of 6, but we can find its position by looking at the multiples of 6.

## Step 3: Find the central number in the hexagon containing 2026
By dividing 2026 by 6, we can find the central number in the hexagon. 2026 ÷ 6 = 338.33, which means the central number is 338.

## Step 4: Identify the hexagon containing 2026
Since the central number is 338, we can find the hexagon containing 2026 by looking at the multiples of 6. The hexagon containing 2026 is the one with the central number 338.

## Step 5: Find the neighbors of 2026
To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to look at the numbers in the adjacent hexagons. Since 2026 is in the hexagon with the central number 338, its neighbors are in the hexagons with the central numbers 332, 340, 336, 342, and 338.

## Step 6: Find the numbers in the adjacent hexagons
By looking at the spiral pattern, we can find the numbers in the adjacent hexagons. The numbers in the hexagons with the central numbers 332, 340, 336, 342, and 338 are 15, 16, 11, 17, and 12, respectively.

## Step 7: Find the sum of the neighbors of 2026
Now that we have the numbers in the adjacent hexagons, we can find the sum of the neighbors of 2026. The sum of the neighbors is 15 + 16 + 11 + 17 + 12 + 2026.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
We can now calculate the sum of the neighbors by adding the numbers together. The sum of the neighbors is 15 + 16 + 11 + 17 + 12 + 2026 = 2027.

## Step 9: Subtract 2026 from the sum of the neighbors
Since the sum of the neighbors includes 2026, we need to subtract 2026 from the sum to get the correct answer.

## Step 10: Calculate the final answer
Subtracting 2026 from the sum of the neighbors, we get 2027 - 2026 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$
