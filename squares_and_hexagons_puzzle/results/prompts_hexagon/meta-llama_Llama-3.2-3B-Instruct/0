## Step 1:  Understanding the layout
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid. The first row has 1 number, the second row has 2 numbers, and so on, forming a hexagonal pattern.

## Step 2:  Identifying the pattern
Looking at the pattern, the numbers increase by 1 as we move right or down. Each number is surrounded by 6 neighbors, which are the numbers above, below, to the left, to the right, and the two diagonals.

## Step 3:  Locating the position of 2026
Since the numbers increase by 1 as we move right or down, we can find the position of 2026 by finding the row and column where it is located.

## Step 4:  Calculating the row and column
We notice that the numbers increase by 1 as we move down the rows. So, the first row has 1, the second row has 2, and so on. Since 2026 is the 36th number in the sequence, it must be in the 6th row (since 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and 15 + 6 = 21, but we are looking for the 36th number, which would be the 6th row).

## Step 5:  Determining the column
Since each number is surrounded by 6 neighbors, we can find the column by finding the remainder when 2026 is divided by 6.

## Step 6:  Calculating the column
2026 ÷ 6 = 338 remainder 2, which means that 2026 is in the 2nd column.

## Step 7:  Locating the neighbors
Since 2026 is in the 6th row and 2nd column, its neighbors are the numbers in the 5th row, 6th column, 4th row, 5th column, 7th row, and 3rd column.

## Step 8:  Finding the values of the neighbors
To find the values of the neighbors, we need to find the numbers in the 5th row, 6th column, 4th row, 5th column, 7th row, and 3rd column.

## Step 9:  Calculating the values of the neighbors
Using the pattern of the spiral, we can find the values of the neighbors: 2026 is in the 6th row, so the numbers above and below it are 2025 and 2027. The numbers to the left and right of it are 2028 and 2024.

## Step 10:  Finding the values of the diagonal neighbors
The diagonal neighbors are 2027 and 2029.

## Step 11:  Calculating the sum of the neighbors
Now we can calculate the sum of the neighbors: 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2024 + 2029 + 2029.

## Step 12:  Evaluating the sum of the neighbors
Performing the arithmetic, we get: 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2024 + 2029 + 2029 = 12170.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12170}$
