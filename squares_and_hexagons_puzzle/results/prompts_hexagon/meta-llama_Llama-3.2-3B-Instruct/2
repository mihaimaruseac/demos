## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers on the hexagonal grid
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid, with each number surrounded by six neighbors.

## Step 2: Identify the position of the number 2026 on the grid
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the grid.

## Step 3: Determine the row and column of the number 2026
We can see that the number 2026 is in the 4th row and 4th column, as the pattern starts from the center and moves outward.

## Step 4: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026
The number 2026 has six neighbors: the numbers above, below, to the left, to the right, and the two diagonals.

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026
Since the number 2026 is in the 4th row and 4th column, we can see that its neighbors are 2028, 2024, 2028, 2026, 2024, and 2028.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors is 2028 + 2024 + 2028 + 2026 + 2024 + 2028.

## Step 7: Simplify the calculation
We can simplify the calculation by adding the numbers: 2028 + 2024 + 2028 + 2026 + 2024 + 2028 = 12180.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026
However, we need to consider that the number 2028 appears three times, so we need to subtract 2 * 2028 from the sum.

## Step 9: Simplify the calculation
The sum of the neighbors is 12180 - 2 * 2028 = 12180 - 4056.

## Step 10: Calculate the final sum
The final sum is 12180 - 4056 = 8084.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8084}$
