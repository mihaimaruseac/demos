## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers on the hexagonal grid.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid, with each row containing one more number than the previous row.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 on the grid.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we can start by identifying the row and column of the number 2026. The first row starts with 14, the second row with 15, and so on. Given the pattern, we can deduce that the number 2026 is in the 7th row.

## Step 3: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026.
To find the neighbors of the number 2026, we need to look at the numbers above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally adjacent to it. However, since 2026 is not in the first or last row, and it's not in the first or last column, we can deduce the neighbors by looking at the pattern.

## Step 4: Calculate the neighbors of the number 2026.
Given the spiral pattern, the neighbors of 2026 would be the numbers in the same row and the numbers in the adjacent rows and columns. Since 2026 is in the 7th row, the numbers above and below it would be in the 6th and 8th row, respectively. The numbers to the left and right would be in the 6th and 8th column, respectively.

## Step 5: Find the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026.
Since the number 2026 is in the 7th row, the numbers in the same row as 2026 are 14, 4, 3, 10, 15, and 5. The numbers above and below 2026 are 16 and 1, respectively, but these are not its neighbors. The numbers to the left and right are 11 and 17, respectively, but again, these are not its neighbors. The neighbors of 2026 are actually the numbers 11, 17, 16, 1, 14, and 15. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that we need to look at the pattern again to correctly identify the neighbors of 2026.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the neighbors of the number 2026 based on the correct pattern.
Given the spiral pattern, the neighbors of 2026 are actually the numbers in the adjacent rows and columns. Since 2026 is in the 7th row, the numbers above and below it would be in the 6th and 8th row, respectively. However, to correctly identify the neighbors, we should look at the pattern again and realize that the neighbors of 2026 are actually the numbers 11, 17, 16, 1, 14, and 15 are not its neighbors, but rather the numbers in the same row as 2026 and the numbers in the adjacent rows and columns.
