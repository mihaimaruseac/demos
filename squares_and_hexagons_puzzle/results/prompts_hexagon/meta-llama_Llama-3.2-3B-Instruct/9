## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers on the hexagonal grid
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a hexagonal grid, starting from the center and moving outward. The first row has 6 numbers, the second row has 6 numbers, and so on. Each number is surrounded by 6 neighbors.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 on the grid
Since the numbers increase by 1 as we move outward from the center, we can find the position of 2026 by counting the numbers outward from the center. The center is 1, the first row is 2, the second row is 3, and so on. 2026 is the 36th number in the sequence.

## Step 3: Identify the position of the number 2026 on the grid
We need to find the row and column where 2026 is located. Since the numbers increase by 1 as we move outward from the center, we can calculate the row and column. The first row has 6 numbers, the second row has 6 numbers, and so on. Since 2026 is the 36th number, we can divide 36 by 6 to get the row and column. 36 divided by 6 is 6, so 2026 is in the 7th row.

## Step 4: Find the 6 neighbors of the number 2026
Since 2026 is in the 7th row, we need to find the 6 neighbors. The neighbors are the numbers above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally above-left, below-right, above-right, and below-left.

## Step 5: Determine the row and column of the neighbors
Since 2026 is in the 7th row, the neighbors will be in the 6th and 8th rows. The neighbors above and below 2026 will be in the 6th row. The neighbors to the left and right will be in the 6th and 8th rows. The neighbors diagonally above-left and below-right will be in the 6th and 8th rows.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Since the numbers are in a spiral pattern, we can calculate the sum of the neighbors by finding the average of the numbers in the same row and column. The average of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026 is the sum of the numbers in the row divided by 6.

## Step 7: Find the numbers in the same row and column as 2026
The numbers in the same row and column as 2026 are 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Since the average of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026 is the sum of the numbers divided by 6, we can calculate the sum of the neighbors by multiplying the average by 6.

## Step 9: Calculate the average of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026
The average of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026 is (2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) / 6.

## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors is (2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) / 6 * 6.

## Step 11: Simplify the expression
The sum of the neighbors simplifies to (2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006).

## Step 12: Calculate the sum
The sum of the numbers is 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 = 12021.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12021}$
