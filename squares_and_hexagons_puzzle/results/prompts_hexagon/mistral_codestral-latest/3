Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to understand how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid and then determine the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Grid Layout

First, let's visualize the given hexagonal grid layout with the numbers:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, we can observe that the numbers are arranged in a hexagonal (honeycomb) pattern. Each number has six neighbors, one in each of the six possible directions in a hexagonal grid.

### Identifying the Pattern

To find a general pattern or formula that places any natural number in its correct position on this hexagonal grid, let's try to understand how the numbers are arranged.

Looking at the center of the given snippet, we see the number `1` at the center. The numbers seem to spiral outward in concentric hexagonal layers.

Let's attempt to reconstruct the layers:

1. **Layer 0 (Center):** Just the number `1`.
2. **Layer 1:** Surrounding `1`, we have `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7` in a hexagonal ring.
   - Starting from the right of `1`, the numbers go clockwise: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`.
3. **Layer 2:** The next layer would have numbers `8` to `19` in a larger hexagonal ring.
   - Continuing the spiral, the numbers increase as we move outward.

From the given snippet, it seems that the numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral manner, with each new layer adding a hexagonal ring around the previous one.

### Determining the Layer for a Given Number

To find the position of a number `n`, we need to determine which layer it belongs to. The layers can be thought of as concentric hexagons where:

- Layer `k` has `6k` numbers (since each side of the hexagon in layer `k` has `k` numbers, and there are 6 sides).

The total number of numbers up to layer `k` is the sum of the numbers in all previous layers plus the numbers in layer `k`:

Total numbers up to layer `k` = `1 + 6*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) + 6k` = `1 + 6*(k-1)*k/2 + 6k` = `1 + 3k(k-1) + 6k` = `3k² - 3k + 1 + 6k` = `3k² + 3k + 1`.

Wait, let's verify this formula with the given numbers:

- Layer 0: `1` number (`1`) → `3*0 + 0 + 1 = 1` ✔
- Layer 1: `6` numbers (`2` to `7`) → `3*1 + 3 + 1 = 7` ✔ (but we have `2` to `7` which is 6 numbers, total up to layer 1 is `1 + 6 = 7` ✔)
- Layer 2: `12` numbers (`8` to `19`) → `3*4 + 6 + 1 = 19` ✔ (but `3*4 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 6 + 1 = 19` ✔)

Hmm, the formula seems to be giving the total numbers up to the end of layer `k`, which is `3k² + 3k + 1`.

But let's see if this makes sense for `k=1`:

For `k=1`: `3*1 + 3 + 1 = 7`, which is correct (numbers `1` to `7`).

For `k=2`: `3*4 + 6 + 1 = 19`, which matches (`1` to `19`).

So, the formula seems correct.

Now, to find the layer `k` for a given number `n`, we can solve for `k` in `3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ n`.

But since the layers are discrete, we can find `k` such that `3(k-1)² + 3(k-1) + 1 < n ≤ 3k² + 3k + 1`.

Alternatively, we can find `k` by solving `3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ n` and taking the smallest integer `k` satisfying this.

For `n=2026`, let's solve `3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026` → `3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0`.

Using the quadratic formula: `k = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 4*3*2025)] / 6` = `[-3 ± sqrt(9 + 24300)] / 6` = `[-3 ± sqrt(24309)] / 6`.

Calculate `sqrt(24309)`:

`155² = 24025`, `156² = 24336`, so `sqrt(24309)` is slightly less than `156`.

`155.9² = 24308.81`, `155.91² ≈ 24309.7`, so `sqrt(24309) ≈ 155.9`.

Thus, `k ≈ [-3 + 155.9]/6 ≈ 152.9/6 ≈ 25.48`.

So, the smallest integer `k` satisfying this is `k=26`.

Let's verify:

For `k=25`: `3*25² + 3*25 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951`.

For `k=26`: `3*26² + 3*26 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107`.

Since `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107`, `2026` is in layer `26`.

### Position Within the Layer

Now, within layer `k=26`, the numbers range from `1952` to `2107` (since up to `k=25` is `1951`).

So, `2026` is the `(2026 - 1951)`th number in layer `26`, which is the `75`th number in layer `26`.

Each side of the hexagon in layer `k` has `k` numbers, so layer `26` has `6*26 = 156` numbers.

The numbers in layer `k` are arranged in six sides, each with `k` numbers. The sides can be labeled as follows (starting from the right of the previous layer):

- Side 0: right (`k` numbers)
- Side 1: top-right (`k` numbers)
- Side 2: top-left (`k` numbers)
- Side 3: left (`k` numbers)
- Side 4: bottom-left (`k` numbers)
- Side 5: bottom-right (`k` numbers)

The first number in layer `k` is `3(k-1)² + 3(k-1) + 2` (since the first number in layer `k` is the one after the last number in layer `k-1`).

For `k=26`: first number is `3*25² + 3*25 + 2 = 1951 + 75 + 2 = 2028`.

Wait, but earlier we had up to `k=25` as `1951`, so the first number in `k=26` should be `1952`.

Hmm, seems there's a discrepancy here. Let me re-examine the formula for the first number in layer `k`.

The last number in layer `k-1` is `3(k-1)² + 3(k-1) + 1`.

The first number in layer `k` is `3(k-1)² + 3(k-1) + 2`.

For `k=1`: last in `k=0` is `1`, first in `k=1` is `2` ✔.

For `k=2`: last in `k=1` is `7`, first in `k=2` is `8` ✔.

So, for `k=26`: first number is `3*25² + 3*25 + 2 = 1951 + 75 + 2 = 2028`.

But `2026` is before `2028`, so it's not in layer `26`. This contradicts our earlier conclusion that `2026` is in layer `26`.

Wait, let's re-examine the layer boundaries:

For `k=25`: up to `1951`.

For `k=26`: `2028` to `2107`.

`2026` is between `1951` and `2028`, so it's not in layer `26`. This suggests an error in our earlier assumption.

Let me re-calculate the layer for `2026`.

We have `3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026`.

For `k=25`: `1951` (too small).

For `k=26`: `2107` (too large).

So `2026` is not in any complete layer. This suggests that our initial assumption about the layer structure might be incorrect.

Perhaps the layers are not complete hexagons up to `k`, but the numbers are assigned in a continuous spiral where each new layer adds a partial hexagon until it completes.

Alternatively, maybe the layers are defined differently. Let me look at the given snippet again:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Here, `1` is at the center, surrounded by `2` to `7` in a hexagon, then `8` to `19` in the next hexagon, etc.

But `2026` is not in the layers we've defined, which suggests that the layers extend much further out.

Perhaps the formula for the layer is incorrect. Let me think differently.

### Alternative Approach: Finding the Layer for `n`

The number of numbers in the first `m` complete layers is `1 + 6*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (m-1)) = 1 + 6*m*(m-1)/2 = 1 + 3m(m-1)`.

We can find `m` such that `1 + 3m(m-1) < n ≤ 1 + 3(m+1)m`.

For `n=2026`:

Find `m` where `1 + 3m(m-1) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3(m+1)m`.

Let's solve `3m² - 3m + 1 ≥ 2026` → `3m² - 3m - 2025 ≥ 0`.

Using quadratic formula: `m = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 24300)] / 6` = `[3 ± sqrt(24309)] / 6`.

`sqrt(24309) ≈ 155.9`, so `m ≈ (3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 158.9/6 ≈ 26.48`.

So `m=26`.

Check:

For `m=26`: `1 + 3*26*25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.

For `m=27`: `1 + 3*27*26 = 1 + 2028 = 2029`.

So `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2029`, meaning `2026` is in the `m=27` layer, with `2026 - 1951 = 75` numbers into the layer.

Each layer `m` has `6m` numbers, so layer `27` has `162` numbers (`2028` to `2189`).

`2026` is the `75`th number in layer `27`.

### Determining the Position on the Hexagonal Grid

Now, within layer `m`, the numbers are arranged in six sides, each with `m` numbers.

The sides are labeled as follows (starting from the right of the previous layer):

- Side 0: right (`m` numbers)
- Side 1: top-right (`m` numbers)
- Side 2: top-left (`m` numbers)
- Side 3: left (`m` numbers)
- Side 4: bottom-left (`m` numbers)
- Side 5: bottom-right (`m` numbers)

The `75`th number in layer `27` is on side `floor(75 / 27) = 2` (since `27*2=54`, `75-54=21`), so it's the `21`st number on side `2` (top-left).

But let's confirm:

Numbers on side `0`: positions `1` to `27` (right)
Side `1`: `28` to `54` (top-right)
Side `2`: `55` to `81` (top-left)
Side `3`: `82` to `108` (left)
Side `4`: `109` to `135` (bottom-left)
Side `5`: `136` to `162` (bottom-right)

`75` is on side `2`, position `75 - 54 = 21`.

### Finding the Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors, one in each of the six directions. The neighbors can be determined based on the position within the layer.

Given that `2026` is the `21`st number on the top-left side of layer `27`, its neighbors are:

1. The previous number on the same side: `2025` (if it exists; since `2026` is the `21`st, the `20`th is `2025`).
2. The next number on the same side: `2027`.
3. The number connecting to the next side (top-left to top-right): This would be the first number on the next side, which is `28` (first on side `1`).
4. The number connecting to the previous side (top-left to left): This would be the last number on the previous side, which is `81` (last on side `2`).
5. The number inside the layer (toward the center): This would be the number in the inner layer that corresponds to this position. For a number on side `2` at position `p`, the inner number is on side `2` at position `p` in layer `m-1`. But since `m=27`, layer `26` has `156` numbers, and the inner number would be at position `21` on side `2` in layer `26`, which is `1951 + 54 + 21 = 2026` (since side `2` in layer `26` is `55` to `80`, `21`st is `75`). Wait, this seems circular. Maybe the inner neighbor is the number directly inside, which is the number in layer `m-1` at the same relative position. For a number on side `2` at position `p` in layer `m`, the inner neighbor is at position `p` on side `2` in layer `m-1`.

   For layer `26`, side `2` is `55` to `80` (since `m=26`, side `2` is `27*2 + 1` to `27*3` = `55` to `81`, but `27*3=81`, so `55` to `80` is `26` numbers, but `m=26` should have `26` numbers per side, so `55` to `80` is `26` numbers). The `21`st number in layer `26` side `2` is `55 + 20 = 75`.

   So inner neighbor is `75`.
6. The number outside the layer (away from the center): Similarly, the outer neighbor would be the number in layer `m+1` at the same relative position. For layer `28`, side `2` is `28*2 + 1` to `28*3` = `57` to `84`. The `21`st is `57 + 20 = 77`.

But let's verify the numbering:

Layer `26`:
- Side `0`: `1` to `26` (right)
- Side `1`: `27` to `52` (top-right)
- Side `2`: `53` to `78` (top-left)
- Side `3`: `79` to `104` (left)
- Side `4`: `105` to `130` (bottom-left)
- Side `5`: `131` to `156` (bottom-right)

Layer `27`:
- Side `0`: `157` to `183` (right)
- Side `1`: `184` to `210` (top-right)
- Side `2`: `211` to `237` (top-left)
- Side `3`: `238` to `264` (left)
- Side `4`: `265` to `291` (bottom-left)
- Side `5`: `292` to `318` (bottom-right)

Wait, earlier I had layer `26` up to `1951`, but now it seems layer `26` has `156` numbers (`1952` to `2107`), which contradicts.

This inconsistency suggests that the initial formula for the total numbers up to layer `k` might be incorrect.

Let me re-examine the layer numbering.

Given the snippet, it seems that the layers are complete hexagons where each layer `k` has `6k` numbers, and the total up to layer `k` is `1 + 6*(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 1 + 3k(k-1)`.

For `k=1`: `1 + 3*1*0 = 1` (correct, only `1`).
`k=2`: `1 + 3*2*1 = 7` (numbers `1` to `7`).
`k=3`: `1 + 3*3*2 = 19` (numbers `1` to `19`).

Given that, for `n=2026`, we find `k` such that `1 + 3k(k-1) < 2026 ≤ 1 + 3(k+1)k`.

Solving `3k² - 3k + 1 ≥ 2026` → `3k² - 3k - 2025 ≥ 0`.

`k ≈ [3 + sqrt(9 + 24300)] / 6 ≈ [3 + 155.9]/6 ≈ 26.48`, so `k=26`.

Check:

`k=25`: `1 + 3*25*24 = 1 + 1800 = 1801`.
`k=26`: `1 + 3*26*25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951`.
`k=27`: `1 + 3*27*26 = 1 + 2028 = 2029`.

So `1951 < 2026 ≤ 2029`, meaning `2026` is in layer `27`, with `2026 - 1951 = 75` numbers into the layer.

Layer `27` has `6*27 = 162` numbers (`1952` to `2113`).

`2026` is the `75`th number in layer `27`.

Now, within layer `27`, the numbers are arranged in six sides, each with `27` numbers.

The sides are:

- Side `0`: right (`1952` to `1978`)
- Side `1`: top-right (`1979` to `2005`)
- Side `2`: top-left (`2006` to `2032`)
- Side `3`: left (`2033` to `2059`)
- Side `4`: bottom-left (`2060` to `2086`)
- Side `5`: bottom-right (`2087` to `2113`)

`2026` is on side `2` (top-left), position `2026 - 2005 = 21`.

So, the neighbors are:

1. Previous on same side: `2025`
2. Next on same side: `2027`
3. Next side (top-left to top-right): first on side `1` is `1979`
4. Previous side (top-left to left): last on side `3` is `2059`
5. Inner neighbor: in layer `26`, side `2` is `53` to `78` (since layer `26` has `156` numbers, side `2` is `53` to `78`). The `21`st is `53 + 20 = 73`.
6. Outer neighbor: in layer `28`, side `2` is `28*2 + 1` to `28*3` = `57` to `84`. The `21`st is `57 + 20 = 77`.

But the outer layer starts at `2114`, so the numbering seems off. Maybe the layers are not complete hexagons.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the coordinates of `2026` in the hexagonal grid and then find its neighbors based on those coordinates.

### Hexagonal Grid Coordinates

In a hexagonal grid, each cell can be identified by three axial coordinates `(q, r, s)` where `q + r + s = 0`.

The neighbors of a cell `(q, r, s)` are:

1. `(q+1, r, s-1)`
2. `(q, r+1, s-1)`
3. `(q-1, r+1, s)`
4. `(q-1, r, s+1)`
5. `(q, r-1, s+1)`
6. `(q+1, r-1, s)`

Given the spiral arrangement, the number `n` can be mapped to these coordinates based on its layer and position within the layer.

However, deriving the exact coordinates for `2026` is non-trivial without a clear formula.

Given the complexity, and since the problem provides a small snippet of the grid, it's likely that the neighbors can be determined by observing the pattern in the given snippet and extending it outward.

From the given snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The number `1` is at the center, surrounded by `2` to `7` in a hexagon, then `8` to `19` in the next hexagon, etc.

The neighbors of `1` are `2` to `7`.

The neighbors of `2` would be `1`, `3`, `8`, `15`, `14`, `9`.

Similarly, the neighbors of `3` are `2`, `4`, `9`, `16`, `15`, `10`.

This suggests that the neighbors are the numbers immediately adjacent in the spiral.

Given that, for `2026`, its neighbors would be:

- The number before it in the spiral: `2025`
- The number after it in the spiral: `2027`
- The number that connects to the next side in the spiral: This would be the first number in the next side of the hexagon.
- The number that connects to the previous side in the spiral: This would be the last number in the previous side of the hexagon.
- The number inside the spiral (closer to the center): This would be the number in the inner layer at the same relative position.
- The number outside the spiral (farther from the center): This would be the number in the outer layer at the same relative position.

Given the complexity, and without a clear formula to map `2026` to its exact position, it's challenging to determine the exact neighbors.

However, based on the pattern observed in the small snippet, the neighbors of `2026` would be:

1. `2025`
2. `2027`
3. The first number on the next side in the spiral: This would be the number that starts the next side of the hexagon in the spiral.
4. The last number on the previous side in the spiral: This would be the number that ends the previous side of the hexagon in the spiral.
5. The number in the inner layer at the same relative position.
6. The number in the outer layer at the same relative position.

Given that, and assuming that the spiral continues outward with each layer adding a complete hexagon, the sum of the neighbors would be:

`2025 + 2027 + (first number on next side) + (last number on previous side) + (inner number) + (outer number)`.

Without a clear way to compute these without the exact spiral mapping, it's impossible to give a precise sum.

However, based on the initial layers and the pattern, the sum of the neighbors of `2026` can be estimated or calculated by finding the exact positions in the spiral, which is complex without additional information.

Given the complexity, and since the problem seems to expect a numerical answer, it's likely that the sum can be computed by carefully determining the positions in the spiral, which would involve:

1. Determining the layer `k` for `2026`.
2. Determining the position within that layer.
3. Calculating the numbers adjacent in the spiral and the inner/outer corresponding numbers.

Given that, and assuming that the spiral follows a consistent pattern where each layer adds a complete hexagon, the sum of the neighbors of `2026` would be:

`2025 + 2027 + (first number on next side) + (last number on previous side) + (inner number) + (outer number)`.

Calculating these precisely would require a more detailed spiral mapping, which is beyond the scope of this initial approach.

### Final Answer

After carefully analyzing the hexagonal spiral and determining the position of the number `2026`, the sum of all six neighbors is:
