Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to understand how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid and then figure out how to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Grid Layout

First, let's visualize the given hexagonal grid with the numbers arranged in a spiral. Here's the provided snippet:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, we can try to deduce the pattern of how numbers are placed on the hexagonal grid. Hexagonal grids can be a bit tricky because each cell has six neighbors, unlike square grids which have four or eight.

### Identifying the Pattern

Let's try to map out the positions of the given numbers to see if we can find a pattern or a rule that determines where each number is placed.

1. **Center of the Spiral**: The number `1` seems to be at the center of the spiral. This is a common starting point for such spirals.

2. **Immediate Neighbors of 1**:
   - Around `1`, we have `2`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and another number (let's see where it is).
   - From the given snippet:
     - `2` is to the right of `1`.
     - `5` is above `1`.
     - `6` is below `1`.
     - `7` is to the bottom-right of `1`.
     - `8` is to the bottom-left of `1`.
     - The sixth neighbor isn't immediately visible, but likely to the top-left of `1`.

3. **Next Layer Outward**:
   - Moving outward from `1`, the next numbers would be placed in a hexagonal ring around `1`.
   - The numbers seem to increase as we move outward in a spiral manner.

### Determining the Spiral's Growth

Hexagonal spirals can grow in layers where each layer forms a hexagon around the previous one. Let's try to see how the numbers are assigned:

- **Layer 0**: Just the center number `1`.
- **Layer 1**: The six numbers around `1`: `2`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and two others (let's say `a` and `b`).
  - From the snippet, `2` is to the right, `5` is above, `6` is below, `7` is bottom-right, `8` is bottom-left.
  - The other two would be top-right and top-left, but they're not given. Maybe `a` is `9` (to the right of `2`), and `b` is `10` (below `10`).

Wait, looking at the snippet:
- `10` is to the right of `3`, which is to the right of `4`, which is to the right of `14`.
- `9` is to the right of `2`.
- `15` is above `14`.
- `16` is below `15`.

This seems messy. Maybe a better approach is to find a general formula or pattern that assigns numbers to positions in the hexagonal grid.

### Hexagonal Grid Coordinates

In a hexagonal grid, positions can be represented using three axes (like in a cube coordinate system), often denoted as `q`, `r`, and `s`, where `q + r + s = 0`. Each hexagon can be identified by these coordinates, and moving in any of the six directions changes one of these coordinates by ±1.

However, this might be too abstract. Let's think differently: perhaps the numbers are assigned based on the distance from the center in a spiral manner, similar to how numbers are arranged in a square spiral but adapted for hexagons.

### Alternative Approach: Numbering Based on Distance from Center

Let's assume that numbers are assigned based on their distance from the center `1`. The distance can be considered in terms of "rings" or "layers" around the center.

- **Distance 0**: `1` (center)
- **Distance 1**: The six numbers immediately surrounding `1`: `2`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and two others (let's say `a` and `b`).
- **Distance 2**: The next ring of numbers, and so on.

But without a clear pattern from the given snippet, this is hard to pin down.

### Looking for a Mathematical Pattern

Perhaps the numbers are assigned based on the sum of their coordinates in some way. For example, in a hexagonal grid, the sum of the coordinates might relate to the number's value.

Alternatively, the numbers might be assigned in a way similar to the "hexagonal numbers" or "centered hexagonal numbers," but those sequences don't seem to match the given snippet.

Given the complexity, maybe the grid is constructed by starting at the center and spiraling outward, assigning numbers sequentially, and the neighbors are the six adjacent cells in the hex grid.

### Assigning Numbers to Positions

Let's attempt to assign numbers to positions based on the given snippet. We'll assume that the grid is infinite and the spiral starts at `1` with its six neighbors assigned in order, then continues outward.

From the snippet:
- `1` is at some position.
- Its neighbors are `2` (right), `5` (up), `6` (down), `7` (down-right), `8` (down-left), and one more (let's say `a` to the left or up-left).

But the snippet shows `10` to the right of `3`, which is to the right of `4`, which is to the right of `14`. This suggests that `14` is to the left of `4`, and `4` is to the left of `3`, and `3` is to the left of `10`.

This seems inconsistent with `2` being to the right of `1`. Maybe the spiral goes right, then up, then left, etc.

Given the confusion, perhaps it's better to find a general formula that assigns numbers to positions based on their coordinates.

### Using Hexagonal Grid Coordinates

Let's define the hexagonal grid using axial coordinates `(q, r)`, where `s = -q - r`. The six directions can be represented as:

1. (+1, 0) - right
2. (0, +1) - up-right
3. (-1, +1) - up-left
4. (-1, 0) - left
5. (0, -1) - down-left
6. (+1, -1) - down-right

The distance from the center `(0, 0)` is given by `(|q| + |r| + |s|) / 2 = (|q| + |r| + |-q - r|) / 2`.

But this seems complex. Maybe there's a simpler numbering scheme.

### Alternative Idea: Spiral Order in Hexagonal Grid

In a hexagonal grid, the spiral order can be defined by moving in a certain direction and turning appropriately. For example, start at the center, move right, then turn 60 degrees left, move, turn 60 degrees right, move, etc., assigning numbers sequentially.

This is similar to how a square spiral works but with hexagonal steps.

Given that, the number `2026` is at some position in this spiral. To find its neighbors, we'd need to determine its coordinates in the spiral.

### Calculating the Position of 2026

First, let's see how many numbers are in each "ring" or "layer" around the center.

- Layer 0: 1 number (`1`)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (`2` to `7`)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (`8` to `19`)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (`20` to `37`)
- ...
- Layer n: 6n numbers

The total numbers up to layer n is the sum of the first n odd multiples of 3 (since each layer adds 6 numbers, starting from 6):

Total up to layer n = 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

We need to find the smallest n such that 1 + 3n(n+1) >= 2026.

Let's solve 3n(n+1) + 1 >= 2026 => 3n² + 3n + 1 >= 2026 => 3n² + 3n - 2025 >= 0

Divide by 3: n² + n - 675 >= 0

Solve n² + n - 675 = 0:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97

n ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485

So n = 25 or 26.

Calculate for n=25:

Total = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

n=26:

Total = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So 2026 is in layer 26 (since 1951 < 2026 <= 2107).

Numbers in layer 26: 2107 - 1951 = 156.

Position in layer 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in layer 26.

### Determining the Coordinates in the Spiral

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers in each layer are assigned in a specific order around the hexagon. The first number in layer n is at a certain position relative to the center, and the subsequent numbers are assigned by moving in a spiral manner.

However, without a clear definition of the spiral's direction and turning rules, it's challenging to determine the exact coordinates of the 75th number in layer 26.

### Alternative Approach: Using Hexagonal Numbers

Perhaps the numbers are assigned based on the "hexagonal numbers" or "centered hexagonal numbers," but these sequences don't seem to match the given snippet.

Given the complexity, maybe the grid is constructed by starting at the center and spiraling outward, assigning numbers sequentially, and the neighbors are the six adjacent cells in the hex grid.

### Finding Neighbors of 2026

Assuming that the spiral is constructed by moving in a certain direction and turning appropriately, the neighbors of a number would be the six adjacent cells in the hex grid.

Given that, to find the sum of the six neighbors of 2026, we'd need to:

1. Determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.
2. Find the six adjacent positions in the hex grid.
3. Determine the numbers at those positions.

But without a clear spiral construction rule, this is difficult.

### Re-evaluating the Approach

Given the complexity, perhaps the grid is constructed by assigning numbers based on the sum of their coordinates in some way, similar to how numbers are assigned in a hexagonal grid where each step changes one coordinate by ±1.

Alternatively, the numbers might be assigned based on the order in which the hexagons are visited in a spiral, and the neighbors are the six adjacent hexagons.

Given that, and since the exact spiral construction isn't specified, it's challenging to determine the neighbors of 2026.

### Possible Solution Path

Given the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps the intended solution is to recognize that in such a spiral, the sum of the six neighbors of a number can be determined by a formula based on the number's position.

However, without more information, it's impossible to accurately determine the sum of the six neighbors of 2026.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the given hexagonal grid and attempting to identify the pattern of number placement, it's evident that the spiral's construction isn't clearly defined in the provided snippet. Without a clear rule for how numbers are assigned to positions in the spiral, determining the exact neighbors of the number 2026 and their sum is not feasible with the current information.

Therefore, the problem requires additional information or a more explicit definition of the spiral's numbering pattern to solve accurately.
