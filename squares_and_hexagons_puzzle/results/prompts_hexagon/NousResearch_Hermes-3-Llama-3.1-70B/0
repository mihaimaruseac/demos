To solve this, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are placed in the hexagonal grid. Let's analyze the given grid:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the center of the spiral is the number 1, and the numbers increase as we move outwards in a clockwise spiral. The neighbors of any number in this grid are the numbers that are directly adjacent to it in the hexagonal pattern. 

Now, let's find the number 2026. Since the spiral increases by 1 for each step outwards, we can calculate the "ring" in which the number 2026 is located. The first ring (around the number 1) contains 6 numbers (2-7). The second ring contains 12 numbers (8-19), and so on. Each subsequent ring contains 6 more numbers than the previous one.

Let's calculate the number of integers in each ring until we reach the ring containing 2026:

1. Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
2. Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
3. Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
4. Ring 4: 24 numbers (38-61)
5. Ring 5: 30 numbers (62-91)
...

We can see that the number of integers in each ring follows an arithmetic progression starting with 6 and having a common difference of 6. The nth term of this progression (which gives the number of integers in the nth ring) can be calculated as:

Number of integers in nth ring = 6 + (n - 1) * 6

Let's find the ring that contains the number 2026:

For the nth ring, the first number in the ring is the sum of all integers in the previous rings plus 1. So, we can calculate the first number in each ring and find the ring in which 2026 lies:

1. Ring 1: First number = 1 + 0 = 1
2. Ring 2: First number = 1 + 6 = 7
3. Ring 3: First number = 7 + 12 = 19
4. Ring 4: First number = 19 + 18 = 37
5. Ring 5: First number = 37 + 24 = 61
...

We continue this process until the first number of a ring is greater than 2026. Let's calculate it:

1. Ring 1: First number = 1
2. Ring 2: First number = 7
3. Ring 3: First number = 19
4. Ring 4: First number = 37
5. Ring 5: First number = 61
6. Ring 6: First number = 91
7. Ring 7: First number = 127
8. Ring 8: First number = 169
9. Ring 9: First number = 217
10. Ring 10: First number = 271
11. Ring 11: First number = 331
12. Ring 12: First number = 397
13. Ring 13: First number = 469
14. Ring 14: First number = 547
15. Ring 15: First number = 631
16. Ring 16: First number = 721
17. Ring 17: First number = 817
18. Ring 18: First number = 919
19. Ring 19: First number = 1027

We can see that 2026 is in the 19th ring, as it is between 1027 (the first number of the 19th ring) and 1133 (the first number of the 20th ring).

Now, to find the neighbors of 2026, we need to consider the position of 2026 in the ring. Since 2026 is the 999th number in the 19th ring (2026 - 1027 + 1 = 999), it is located on the edge of the hexagonal grid, and its neighbors will be the numbers that come before and after it in the sequence, as well as the numbers that are diagonally adjacent to it in the spiral.

However, calculating the exact neighbors without a visual representation of the spiral up to 2026 is quite complex and would require a more detailed understanding of the spiral's geometry. This is not a straightforward calculation, and it would be more efficient to use a program or a visual tool to determine the exact positions of the numbers around 2026.

If you have a specific method or additional information that could help us determine the neighbors of 2026, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
