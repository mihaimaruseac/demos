To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral on the hexagonal grid. Let's analyze the given spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can see that the numbers are increasing in a spiral pattern. The center of the spiral is 1, and the numbers increase as we move outwards in a clockwise direction.

Now, let's find the position of the number 2026. Since the spiral is on a hexagonal grid, each layer forms a larger hexagon. The number of cells in each layer can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2, where n is the layer number.

Let's find the layer that contains the number 2026:

Layer 1: 1 cell (number 1)
Layer 2: 6 cells (numbers 2 to 7)
Layer 3: 12 cells (numbers 8 to 19)
Layer 4: 18 cells (numbers 20 to 37)
...

We can see that each layer adds 6 cells to the previous layer. So, we can find the layer that contains 2026 by subtracting the number of cells in each layer until we reach 2026:

2026 - 1 (Layer 1) = 2025
2025 - 6 (Layer 2) = 2019
2019 - 12 (Layer 3) = 2007
2007 - 18 (Layer 4) = 1989
1989 - 24 (Layer 5) = 1965
1965 - 30 (Layer 6) = 1935
1935 - 36 (Layer 7) = 1899
1899 - 42 (Layer 8) = 1857
1857 - 48 (Layer 9) = 1809
1809 - 54 (Layer 10) = 1755
1755 - 60 (Layer 11) = 1695
1695 - 66 (Layer 12) = 1629
1629 - 72 (Layer 13) = 1557
1557 - 78 (Layer 14) = 1479
1479 - 84 (Layer 15) = 1395
1395 - 90 (Layer 16) = 1305
1305 - 96 (Layer 17) = 1209
1209 - 102 (Layer 18) = 1107
1107 - 108 (Layer 19) = 999
999 - 114 (Layer 20) = 885
885 - 120 (Layer 21) = 765
765 - 126 (Layer 22) = 639
639 - 132 (Layer 23) = 507
507 - 138 (Layer 24) = 369
369 - 144 (Layer 25) = 225
225 - 150 (Layer 26) = 75
75 - 156 (Layer 27) = -81

Since we've reached a negative number, it means that 2026 is in Layer 27 of the spiral.

Now, we need to find the exact position of 2026 within Layer 27. We can calculate the starting number of Layer 27:

Starting number of Layer 27 = 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 156
= 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 26)
= 1 + 6(26*27)/2
= 1 + 6(351)
= 1 + 2106
= 2107

So, the number 2026 is the 20th number in Layer 27 (since 2026 - 2107 = 19, and we start counting from 0).

Now, let's find the 6 neighbors of 2026:

1. The number before 2026 in Layer 27: 2025
2. The number after 2026 in Layer 27: 2027
3. The number directly above 2026 (in Layer 26): 1975 (since 2026 - 51 = 1975)
4. The number to the upper left of 2026 (in Layer 26): 1974
5. The number to the upper right of 2026 (in Layer 26): 1976
6. The number directly below 2026 (in Layer 28): 2077 (since 2026 + 51 = 2077)

The sum of these 6 neighbors is:

2025 + 2027 + 1975 + 1974 + 1976 + 2077 = 10954

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 10954.
