To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are placed on the hexagonal grid. Let's break it down step by step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern of the spiral. The spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outwards in a hexagonal pattern. The numbers increase consecutively as we move outwards.

2) Now, let's try to find the position of 2026 in the spiral. We can do this by finding how many numbers are in each "layer" of the spiral.

   - The first layer (just the center) has 1 number.
   - The second layer (the first hexagonal ring) has 6 numbers.
   - The third layer (the second hexagonal ring) has 12 numbers.
   - In general, the nth layer has 6(n-1) numbers.

3) We can find the layer of 2026 by summing the numbers in each layer until we exceed 2026:

   1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 30 + 36 + 42 + 48 = 217

   2026 is in the 9th layer (the 8th hexagonal ring).

4) The sum of the numbers in the nth layer is given by the formula: 

   Sum = 3n(n-1) + 1

   So, the sum of the numbers in the 8th layer is:

   Sum = 3 * 8 * 7 + 1 = 169

5) The numbers in the 8th layer range from 217 to 385. So, 2026 is in the 9th layer, which ranges from 386 to 553.

6) Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 9th layer. We can do this by subtracting 385 from 2026:

   2026 - 385 = 1641

   This means 2026 is the 1641st number in the 9th layer.

7) Since each side of the hexagon in the 9th layer has 18 numbers, we can find the side on which 2026 is located:

   1641 ÷ 18 = 91 remainder 3

   This means 2026 is on the 91st number of the 3rd side.

8) The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it in the spiral. Since it's on the 3rd side, it will have 3 neighbors from the 8th layer (the previous ring) and 3 neighbors from the 10th layer (the next ring).

9) The 3 neighbors from the 8th layer are the last 2 numbers of the 2nd side and the first number of the 3rd side. These numbers are:

   382, 383, 384

10) The 3 neighbors from the 10th layer are the numbers corresponding to 2026 on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sides of the 10th layer. These numbers are:

    2026 + 18 = 2044 (1st side)
    2026 + 36 = 2062 (2nd side)
    2026 + 54 = 2080 (3rd side)

11) Therefore, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:

    382, 383, 384, 2044, 2062, 2080

12) The sum of these numbers is:

    382 + 383 + 384 + 2044 + 2062 + 2080 = 6235

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 6235.
