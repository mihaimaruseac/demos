To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral on the hexagonal grid. Let's analyze the given spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can see that the center of the spiral is 1, and the numbers increase as we move outwards. The spiral goes in a clockwise direction, starting from the top and moving to the right.

Now, let's find the position of the number 2026 on the spiral. Since the spiral increases by 1 for each step, we can calculate the number of steps from the center (1) to 2026:

Number of steps = 2026 - 1 = 2025

Each complete loop around the spiral (hexagon) consists of 6 steps (one for each side of the hexagon). To find out how many complete loops we have made, we divide the number of steps by 6:

Number of complete loops = 2025 ÷ 6 = 337 with a remainder of 3

This means that after 337 complete loops, we are 3 steps away from the center of the next loop. The number 2026 is located 3 steps to the right of the center of the 338th loop.

Now, let's find the 6 neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is 3 steps to the right of the center of the 338th loop, its neighbors will be:

1. The number 3 steps to the left of 2026 (same loop)
2. The number directly above 2026 (previous loop)
3. The number 3 steps to the right of 2026 and then up (previous loop)
4. The number 3 steps to the right of 2026 and then down (next loop)
5. The number directly below 2026 (next loop)
6. The number 3 steps to the left of 2026 and then down (next loop)

To find these numbers, we need to calculate the difference in steps between each neighbor and the number 2026:

1. 3 steps to the left: 2026 - 3 = 2023
2. Directly above: 2026 - 6 (one loop back) = 2020
3. 3 steps to the right and then up: 2026 + 3 - 6 = 2023
4. 3 steps to the right and then down: 2026 + 3 + 6 = 2035
5. Directly below: 2026 + 6 = 2032
6. 3 steps to the left and then down: 2026 - 3 + 6 = 2029

Now, let's sum up these neighbors:

2023 + 2020 + 2023 + 2035 + 2032 + 2029 = 12162

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12,162.
