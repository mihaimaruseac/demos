To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral on the hexagonal grid. The spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outward in a hexagonal pattern. Each number is surrounded by six neighbors, except for the numbers on the edges of the spiral.

The number 2026 is not on the edge, so it will have six neighbors. To find the neighbors, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral. The difference between consecutive numbers in the same row increases by 6 for each row as we move away from the center.

For example, the differences between consecutive numbers in the first few rows are:
- Row 1 (center): N/A
- Row 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (differences are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
- Row 3: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (differences are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
- Row 4: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 (differences are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

As we move to the next row, the differences increase by 6. So, for the next row, the differences would be 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, and so on.

To find the row in which 2026 is located, we can calculate the sum of the first n rows and find the value of n for which this sum is just less than 2026. The sum of the first n rows can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

For each row, the first term is the number at the start of the row, and the last term is the number at the end of the row. The difference between consecutive numbers in the same row is constant and equal to the row number minus 1.

Let's find the row for 2026:

Row 1: 1
Row 2: 1 + 6 = 7
Row 3: 7 + 6*6 = 43
Row 4: 43 + 6*12 = 115
Row 5: 115 + 6*18 = 247
Row 6: 247 + 6*24 = 451
Row 7: 451 + 6*30 = 721
Row 8: 721 + 6*36 = 1069
Row 9: 1069 + 6*42 = 1515
Row 10: 1515 + 6*48 = 2051

2026 is in row 10 because 2051 is the first sum that exceeds 2026.

Now, let's find the position of 2026 within row 10. We know that the first number in row 10 is 1516 (since 1515 is the last number in row 9), and the differences between consecutive numbers in row 10 are 7. We can find the position by subtracting 1515 from 2026 and then dividing by 7:

2026 - 1515 = 511
511 / 7 = 73

So, 2026 is the 73rd number in row 10.

The neighbors of 2026 will be:
- The number that is 7 before it in the same row (2026 - 7 = 2019)
- The number that is 7 after it in the same row (2026 + 7 = 2033)
- The number that is 48 before it (one row up and 7 less, 2026 - 48 = 1978)
- The number that is 48 after it (one row down and 7 more, 2026 + 48 = 2074)
- The number that is 42 before it (one row up and 7 more, 2026 - 42 = 1984)
- The number that is 42 after it (one row down and 7 less, 2026 + 42 = 2068)

Now, we can sum these neighbors:

2019 + 2033 + 1978 + 2074 + 1984 + 2068 = 12056

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is 12056.
