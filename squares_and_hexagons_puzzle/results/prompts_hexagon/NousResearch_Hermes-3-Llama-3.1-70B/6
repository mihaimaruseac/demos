To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are placed in the hexagonal grid. Let's analyze the given spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can see that the spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outward in a hexagonal pattern. The numbers increase as we move away from the center. The neighbors of any number in this grid are the six numbers that surround it, three in the same row and three in the adjacent rows.

To find the number 2026, we need to determine its position in the spiral. Since the spiral increases by 1 for each step away from the center, we can calculate the number of steps from the center to 2026 by subtracting 1 and then dividing by the number of steps per spiral arm, which is 3 (since there are three arms in the hexagon).

2026 - 1 = 2025
2025 / 3 = 675

This means that 2026 is 675 steps away from the center. However, this calculation does not give us the exact position of 2026 in the spiral, as the spiral does not increase linearly but in a hexagonal pattern. To find the exact position, we would need to construct the spiral up to the point where 2026 appears.

Constructing the entire spiral up to 2026 is a complex task and would require a detailed algorithm to place each number correctly. However, we can estimate the general area where 2026 would be located. Since the spiral increases by 6 for each complete hexagonal ring (one ring is completed every time we return to the starting point after going around the spiral once), we can estimate that 2026 would be in the 675th ring or somewhere close to it.

Finding the exact neighbors of 2026 would require knowing the specific positions of the numbers around it, which is not feasible without constructing the entire spiral. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact sum of the six neighbors of 2026 without additional information or a method to construct the spiral up to that number.
