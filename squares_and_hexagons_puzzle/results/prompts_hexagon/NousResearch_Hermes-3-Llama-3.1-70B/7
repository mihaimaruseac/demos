To solve this, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are increasing. Let's analyze the given spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can see that the spiral starts at 1 and increases as it moves outwards in a clockwise direction. The difference between the numbers in the spiral is not constant, but it follows a pattern related to the hexagonal grid.

Now, let's find the position of the number 2026. Since the spiral increases as it moves outwards, we need to determine which "layer" of the spiral 2026 is on. We can do this by finding the sum of the first few layers and seeing where 2026 falls.

The first layer (the center) is just the number 1.
The second layer is the next 6 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), summing up to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
The third layer is the next 12 numbers, and so on.

The nth layer will have 6n numbers, and the sum of the numbers in the nth layer can be found by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. However, we don't need the exact sum; we just need to find the range where 2026 falls.

Let's find the starting number of each layer:
1st layer: 1
2nd layer: 1 + 6 = 7
3rd layer: 7 + 6*6 = 43
4th layer: 43 + 6*12 = 91
5th layer: 91 + 6*18 = 163
6th layer: 163 + 6*24 = 259
7th layer: 259 + 6*30 = 379
8th layer: 379 + 6*36 = 523
9th layer: 523 + 6*42 = 691
10th layer: 691 + 6*48 = 883
11th layer: 883 + 6*54 = 1099
12th layer: 1099 + 6*60 = 1339
13th layer: 1339 + 6*66 = 1603
14th layer: 1603 + 6*72 = 1881
15th layer: 1881 + 6*78 = 2173
16th layer: 2173 + 6*84 = 2489
17th layer: 2489 + 6*90 = 2829
18th layer: 2829 + 6*96 = 3185
19th layer: 3185 + 6*102 = 3565
20th layer: 3565 + 6*108 = 3969
21st layer: 3969 + 6*114 = 4397
22nd layer: 4397 + 6*120 = 4849
23rd layer: 4849 + 6*126 = 5325
24th layer: 5325 + 6*132 = 5825
25th layer: 5825 + 6*138 = 6359
26th layer: 6359 + 6*144 = 6917
27th layer: 6917 + 6*150 = 7501
28th layer: 7501 + 6*156 = 8119
29th layer: 8119 + 6*162 = 8761
30th layer: 8761 + 6*168 = 9427
31st layer: 9427 + 6*174 = 10117
32nd layer: 10117 + 6*180 = 10831
33rd layer: 10831 + 6*186 = 11569
34th layer: 11569 + 6*192 = 12331
35th layer: 12331 + 6*198 = 13117
36th layer: 13117 + 6*204 = 13927
37th layer: 13927 + 6*210 = 14761
38th layer: 14761 + 6*216 = 15619
39th layer: 15619 + 6*222 = 16499
40th layer: 16499 + 6*228 = 17401
41st layer: 17401 + 6*234 = 18325
42nd layer: 18325 + 6*240 = 19271
43rd layer: 19271 + 6*246 = 20239
44th layer: 20239 + 6*252 = 21229

2026 falls between the 43rd layer (19271) and the 44th layer (20239). So, 2026 is in the 44th layer.

Now, to find the 6 neighbors of 2026, we need to consider the spiral pattern. The neighbors will be the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in the spiral, which could include numbers from the same layer, the previous layer, and the next layer.

However, without knowing the exact pattern of how the numbers increase within each layer and how they connect to the previous and next layers, we cannot determine the exact neighbors of 2026. The pattern provided in the initial spiral is not sufficient to extrapolate the positions of numbers in the 44th layer and their neighbors.

Therefore, with the given information, it's not possible to determine the exact 6 neighbors of 2026 or their sum.
