To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are arranged. Let's analyze the given spiral:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

We can see that the spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outward in a hexagonal pattern. The numbers increase as we move away from the center. 

To find the number 2026, we need to determine which layer of the spiral it is in. We can do this by calculating the sum of the numbers in each layer until we reach or exceed 2026.

Layer 1 (center): 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (sum = 54)
Layer 3: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 (sum = 324)
Layer 4: 29, 30, ..., 54 (sum = 702)
Layer 5: 55, 56, ..., 88 (sum = 1296)
Layer 6: 89, 90, ..., 120 (sum = 2088)
Layer 7: 121, 122, ..., 150 (sum = 2985)

We can see that 2026 falls within the seventh layer of the spiral. Now, we need to find the exact position of 2026 within this layer.

The sum of the numbers up to layer 6 is 2088. So, to find the position of 2026, we subtract 2088 from 2026:

2026 - 2088 = -62

This means that 2026 is the 62nd number in the seventh layer, counting from the beginning of the layer.

Now, we need to find the neighbors of 2026. In a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors: two in the same layer, two in the inner layer, and two in the outer layer.

Since 2026 is in the seventh layer, its two neighbors in the same layer are the 61st and 63rd numbers of the seventh layer. The two neighbors in the inner layer (sixth layer) are the 62nd and 63rd numbers of the sixth layer. The two neighbors in the outer layer (eighth layer) are the 60th and 61st numbers of the eighth layer.

Let's find these numbers:

61st number in the seventh layer: 2026 - 1 = 2025
63rd number in the seventh layer: 2026 + 1 = 2027
62nd number in the sixth layer: 2088 + 62 = 2150
63rd number in the sixth layer: 2088 + 63 = 2151
60th number in the eighth layer: 2985 - 60 = 2925
61st number in the eighth layer: 2985 - 59 = 2926

Now, we can sum these neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 2150 + 2151 + 2925 + 2926 = 15204

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is 15,204.
