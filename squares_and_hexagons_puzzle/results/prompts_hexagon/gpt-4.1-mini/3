We have a hexagonal spiral with natural numbers arranged in a hexagonal grid pattern. The example given:

```
... 14 4  3  10 ...
.. 15 5  1  2  9 ...
... 16 6  7  8 ...
```

We are asked: **What is the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the hexagonal spiral layout

In a hexagonal spiral numbering scheme:

- Number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers are laid out in "rings" around 1.
- Each ring \(n\) has \(6n\) numbers and forms a hexagon.
- The total numbers up to ring \(n\) is \(1 + 6(1 + 2 + \cdots + n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)\).

The rings are numbered:
- Ring 0: just number 1
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 20 to 37 (18 numbers)
- etc.

---

### Step 2: Find which ring 2026 is in

The total numbers up to ring \(n\) is:

\[
T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

We want to find \(n\) such that

\[
T(n-1) < 2026 \leq T(n)
\]

Test:

- For \(n=25\):

\[
T(25) = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026
\]

- For \(n=26\):

\[
T(26) = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \geq 2026
\]

So 2026 lies in **ring 26**.

---

### Step 3: Position of 2026 in ring 26

- The first number in ring 26 is:

\[
F_{26} = T(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952
\]

- 2026 is the \((2026 - 1952 + 1) = 75\)-th number of ring 26.

---

### Step 4: Geometry setup and hex coordinates

It's useful to represent the hex grid using **axial coordinates \((q, r)\)**.

- Center (1) is at \((0,0)\).
- Ring \(n\) is all hex cells at hex distance \(n\) from (0,0).

The ring numbering starts at the "top" hex in ring \(n\) and proceeds clockwise or counterclockwise around the hexagon.

---

### Step 5: Determine coordinates of \(2026\)

- The hex ring \(n=26\) has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) cells.
- The cells are numbered 1 to 156 around the ring, starting from the "top" hex.

**Ring 26 numbering:**

- Number 1952 corresponds to cell 1 on ring 26.
- Number 2026 corresponds to cell 75 on ring 26.

---

### Step 6: Position cell 1 on ring \(n\)

Coordinates of cell 1 on ring \(n\) is \((q, r) = (0, -n)\).

For \(n=26\), cell 1 is at:

\[
(0, -26)
\]

---

### Step 7: Directions around the hexagon

We move around the ring in 6 segments, each of length \(n\).

The 6 directions (hex step vectors) in axial coordinates are (starting from "top" and going clockwise):

1. \( (1, -1) \)
2. \( (1, 0) \)
3. \( (0, 1) \)
4. \( (-1, 1) \)
5. \( (-1, 0) \)
6. \( (0, -1) \)

The ring starts at \((0,-n)\) and moves:

- \(n\) steps in direction 1
- \(n\) steps in direction 2
- \(n\) steps in direction 3
- \(n\) steps in direction 4
- \(n\) steps in direction 5
- \(n\) steps in direction 6

---

### Step 8: Find which segment cell 75 lies on

Segment size = 26.

Cell 75 means:

- Step index \(s = 75 - 1 = 74\) (zero-based index on the ring)

Segment number:

\[
\text{segment} = \left\lfloor \frac{74}{26} \right\rfloor = 2
\]

Position inside segment:

\[
\text{offset} = 74 \mod 26 = 22
\]

---

Segments:

- 0 -> direction 1 = (1, -1)
- 1 -> direction 2 = (1, 0)
- 2 -> direction 3 = (0, 1) ← our segment
- 3 -> direction 4 = (-1, 1)
- 4 -> direction 5 = (-1, 0)
- 5 -> direction 6 = (0, -1)

Starting point for segment 2 is:

- Move 26 steps direction 1, then 26 steps direction 2 from \((0, -26)\)

Calculate starting coordinate of segment 2:

- Start:

\[
(0, -26)
\]

- After segment 0 (direction 1):

\[
(0, -26) + 26 \times (1, -1) = (26, -52)
\]

- After segment 1 (direction 2):

\[
(26, -52) + 26 \times (1, 0) = (52, -52)
\]

Starting coordinate for segment 2 is \((52, -52)\).

---

### Step 9: Move 22 steps into segment 2 (direction (0, 1))

Add:

\[
22 \times (0, 1) = (0, 22)
\]

So coordinate of cell 75 is:

\[
(52, -52) + (0, 22) = (52, -30)
\]

---

### Step 10: Find neighbors of \((52, -30)\)

Neighbors in axial coordinates are given by adding one of the six direction vectors:

\[
N = \{
(1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1)
\}
\]

Neighbors of \((52, -30)\) are:

1. \((53, -30)\)
2. \((53, -31)\)
3. \((52, -31)\)
4. \((51, -30)\)
5. \((51, -29)\)
6. \((52, -29)\)

---

### Step 11: Convert neighbor coordinates back to numbers

We need a function to convert from \( (q, r) \) to the number in the spiral.

---

### Step 12: Formula for number from (q, r)

- Ring number \(n = \max(|q|, |r|, | -q - r |)\) (hex distance)
- Number of cells before ring \(n\) is \(1 + 3(n-1)n\)
- Determine position \(p\) of \((q,r)\) on ring \(n\)

---

### Step 13: Calculate ring number for neighbors

Calculate \(s = -q - r\).

Note: Hex distance is \(n = \max(|q|, |r|, |s|)\).

For example:

For the cell \((52, -30)\), 

\[
s = -52 - (-30) = -52 + 30 = -22.
\]

\[
|52|=52, |-30|=30, | -22|=22
\]

\[
n = \max(52, 30, 22) = 52
\]

This conflicts with previous \(n=26\). There must be a mismatch here.

---

### Reconsider step 9-10:

The max coordinate in \(q, r\) was very large. Since \(n=26\), the coordinates must have max absolute value equal to 26.

We must have an error in the directions or coordinate system.

---

### Step 14: Correct axial coordinate system for hex spiral rings

The hex spiral ring is points at distance \(n\), i.e.:

\[
n = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|)
\]

We had starting cell at \((0, -n)\), so for \(n=26\), start is \((0, -26)\).

Now direction vectors around ring should be:

Starting from \((0,-n)\), going clockwise:

1. direction 0: \( (+1, 0) \)
2. direction 1: \( (+1, -1) \)
3. direction 2: \( (0, -1) \)
4. direction 3: \( (-1, 0) \)
5. direction 4: \( (-1, +1) \)
6. direction 5: \( (0, +1) \)

We previously had different directions based on different orientation.

---

### Step 15: Use standard cube coordinate directions

Let's map to cube coordinates \((x, y, z)\) with \(x + y + z = 0\):

Direction vectors are (cube coordinates):

1. \( (1, -1, 0) \)
2. \( (1, 0, -1) \)
3. \( (0, 1, -1) \)
4. \( (-1, 1, 0) \)
5. \( (-1, 0, 1) \)
6. \( (0, -1, 1) \)

Axial coordinates correspond to:

\[
q = x, \quad r = z
\]

So directions in axial coordinates:

1. \( (1, 0) \)
2. \( (1, -1) \)
3. \( (0, -1) \)
4. \( (-1, 0) \)
5. \( (-1, 1) \)
6. \( (0, 1) \)

---

### Step 16: Start point on ring \(n\)

The ring \(n\) starts at the point:

\[
(0, -n)
\]

The ring is traversed by moving \(n\) steps in each of the directions 0 to 5 from the start point in order:

Directions around ring:

- segment 0: direction 0
- segment 1: direction 1
- segment 2: direction 2
- segment 3: direction 3
- segment 4: direction 4
- segment 5: direction 5

---

### Step 17: Calculate position for cell 75 in ring 26

- Cell 75 on ring 26 (indexing 1..156)
- zero-based index:

\[
i = 75 - 1 = 74
\]

- segment:

\[
s = \left\lfloor \frac{74}{26} \right\rfloor = 2
\]

- offset in segment:

\[
d = 74 \mod 26 = 22
\]

---

### Step 18: Calculate start of segment 2

Start at \((0, -26)\).

Directions:

- dir0: (1, 0)
- dir1: (1, -1)
- dir2: (0, -1)
- dir3: (-1, 0)
- dir4: (-1, 1)
- dir5: (0, 1)

We move from:

\[
\text{start of segment } s = \sum_{k=0}^{s-1} n \times \text{dir}_k + (0, -n)
\]

Calculate:

For \(s=2\):

\[
(0, -26) + 26 \times dir0 + 26 \times dir1
\]

Calculate:

- \(26 \times dir0 = (26, 0)\)
- \(26 \times dir1 = (26, -26)\)

Sum:

\[
(0, -26) + (26, 0) + (26, -26) = (52, -52)
\]

---

### Step 19: Move offset \(d=22\) steps along dir2 = (0, -1)

So position:

\[
(52, -52) + 22 \times (0, -1) = (52, -74)
\]

---

### Step 20: Find \(n = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|)\)

Calculate:

\[
s = -q - r = -52 - (-74) = -52 + 74 = 22
\]

\[
\max(|52|, | -74|, |22|) = \max(52,74,22) = 74
\]

This says the hex distance of this coordinate is 74, not 26, which is inconsistent.

---

### Step 21: The problem: direction assignment might be reversed or misunderstood.

---

### Alternative approach:

Many hex spiral assignments store ring \(n\) cells with \(n = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|)\).

Since coordinates grow large here, the initial direction labeling might be wrong.

To fix, let's assign directions around ring \(n\) as:

- start at \((0, n)\), not \((0, -n)\).

Try start cell on ring at \((0, n) = (0, 26)\).

---

### Step 22: Using start cell \((0, n)\), directions from start:

Let's use six directions corresponding to ring traversal (clockwise):

- dir0: (1, -1)
- dir1: (1, 0)
- dir2: (0, 1)
- dir3: (-1, 1)
- dir4: (-1, 0)
- dir5: (0, -1)

---

### Step 23: Calculate position for cell 75 in ring 26

Start:

\[
(0, 26)
\]

Segment 2 means we have moved 26 steps * dir0 + 26 steps * dir1 from start.

- \(26 \times dir0 = 26 \times (1, -1) = (26, -26)\)
- \(26 \times dir1 = 26 \times (1, 0) = (26, 0)\)

Sum:

\[
(0, 26) + (26, -26) + (26, 0) = (52, 0)
\]

Move 22 steps along dir2 = (0, 1):

\[
(52, 0) + 22 (0, 1) = (52, 22)
\]

---

### Step 24: Calculate ring number \(n = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|)\)

\[
s = -52 - 22 = -74
\]

\[
\max(52, 22, 74) = 74
\]

Again 74, inconsistent with expected 26.

---

### Step 25: Let's check the formula for ring number again

Try a different approach.

In hex axial coordinates the rings form a hexagon around center. The points on ring \(n\) are those at hex distance \(n\).

Hex distance from (0,0) to (q,r):

\[
d = \frac{|q| + |r| + | -q-r |}{2}
\]

Calculate for \((52, 22)\):

\[
|52| + |22| + | -74| = 52 + 22 + 74 = 148
\]

Distance \(d = \frac{148}{2} = 74\neq 26\)

---

### Step 26: Conclusion

None of these large coordinates have hex distance 26. Their distance is 74, which matches the coordinate magnitude.

---

### Step 27: Guess the error is in scaling: the directions should be unit steps but accumulated as 1 not \(n\).

Meaning maybe the step length is 1 not \(n\) when moving around the ring.

---

### Step 28: Adjust step length from \(n\) to 1

The ring has \(6n\) steps, so for each segment: \(n\) steps in the direction.

So step by step:

- For segment 0: steps 0 to \(n-1\)
- For segment 1: steps \(n\) to \(2n-1\)
- For segment s: steps \(s \times n\) to \((s+1) \times n -1\)

Our cell index 74 is in segment 74 // 26 = 2, offset 74 % 26=22 as before.

Let's build path starting at \((0, n) = (0, 26)\).

-- These are unit moves:

- From (0, 26), move 2 segments:
   - 26 steps in dir0
   - 22 steps in dir1

---

### Step 29: Calculate final coordinates

Wait, earlier we reversed segment and offset (maybe swapped).

Actually:

- From start point \((0, n)\),
- Subtract \(s\), or,

The ring traversal is:

- Start at \((0, n)\)
- Move \(s\) segments times \(n\) steps each, except last segment where only offset steps.

Directions for segments:

- segment 0: dir0 = (-1, 1)
- segment 1: dir1 = (-1, 0)
- segment 2: dir2 = (0, -1)
- segment 3: dir3 = (1, -1)
- segment 4: dir4 = (1, 0)
- segment 5: dir5 = (0, 1)

The order and directions depend on orientation.

---

### Step 30: Use example from OEIS A003215 (hex spiral):

According to [OEIS A003215](https://oeis.org/A003215), the hex spiral starts at 1 with coords (0,0), and the ring \(n\) starts from top cell at \((0,n)\) and proceeds in directions:

1. down-left \( (-1, 1) \),
2. left \( (-1, 0) \),
3. down \( (0, -1) \),
4. down-right \( (1, -1) \),
5. right \( (1, 0) \),
6. up \( (0, 1) \).

---

### Step 31: Let's use these directions and recalculate coordinates for cell 75:

- Start cell at ring 26:

\[
(0, 26)
\]

- number of cells in ring 26 = \(6 \times 26 = 156\)

- cell 75 corresponds to index \(74\) zero-based.

---

### Step 32: Find segment and offset:

\[
s = \lfloor 74 / 26 \rfloor = 2
\]
\[
d = 74 \mod 26 = 22
\]

---

### Step 33: Move \(s\) full segments (\(s \times n\) steps each) + offset \(d\) steps in segment:

Sum of movement vector:

\[
\text{pos} = (0, 26) + 26 \times \sum_{k=0}^{s-1} dir_k + d \times dir_s
\]

Calculate the cumulative sum for \(k=0\) and \(k=1\):

- dir0 = (-1, 1)
- dir1 = (-1, 0)

Sum dir0 + dir1:

\[
(-1, 1) + (-1, 0) = (-2, 1)
\]

Multiply by 26:

\[
(-2 \times 26, 1 \times 26) = (-52, 26)
\]

Add to start:

\[
(0, 26) + (-52, 26) = (-52, 52)
\]

---

### Step 34: Add offset steps:

Segment 2 direction \(dir_2 = (0, -1)\)

Offset \(d = 22\) steps:

\[
(0, -1) \times 22 = (0, -22)
\]

Add:

\[
(-52, 52) + (0, -22) = (-52, 30)
\]

---

### Step 35: Coordinates for cell 75 = \((-52, 30)\)

---

### Step 36: Check ring number \(n\)

Calculate:

\[
s = -q - r = -(-52) - 30 = 52 - 30 = 22
\]

Calculate hex distance =

\[
d = \frac{|q| + |r| + |s|}{2} = \frac{52 + 30 + 22}{2} = \frac{104}{2} = 52
\]

This is \(n=52\), but our ring is 26.

---

### Step 37: Correct the cube coordinates mapping

Axial coordinates often defined as:

\[
q = x, \quad r = z
\]

with \(y = -x - z\).

Then:

\[
\text{distance} = \max(|x|, |y|, |z|)
\]

For \((q,r) = (-52,30)\):

\[
x = -52, \quad z=30, \quad y = -x - z = 52 - 30 = 22
\]

Distance:

\[
\max(|-52|, |22|, |30|) = 52
\]

So distance \(=52\) not 26.

---

### Step 38: Hypothesis: Either start coordinate or directions are wrong given the problem's numbering.

---

### Step 39: Fix starting radius

The problem says the numbers in ring \(n\) number \(6n\) and last number in ring \(n\) is at most:

\[
T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

So:

For \(n=26\):

\[
T(26) = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2107
\]

We have ring 26 contains numbers 1952 to 2107.

Cell 75 in ring 26 has number:

\[
1952 + 75 - 1 = 2026
\]

Exactly the number in question.

---

### Step 40: Use (cube) coordinates with distance \(n=26\) for cell 75.

Cell 75 index 74 (0-based) along the ring.

Since there are \(6 \times 26 = 156\) cells in ring 26.

Each segment has length 26.

---

### Step 41: Directions for ring traversal commonly defined as:

Starting at top point (0, -n):

- dir0 = (1, 0, -1)
- dir1 = (1, -1, 0)
- dir2 = (0, -1, 1)
- dir3 = (-1, 0, 1)
- dir4 = (-1, 1, 0)
- dir5 = (0, 1, -1)

Pick axial coordinates as \((q, r) = (x, y)\) or \((q, r) = (x, z)\).

Let's consistently use:

\[
q = x, \quad r = y
\]

Cube coords:

- start at \((0, -n, n)\) cell 1 of ring \(n\).

For \(n=26\):

\[
(0, -26, 26)
\]

---

### Step 42: Walk 74 steps around ring

Number of steps into ring:

\[
i = 74
\]

The steps around ring are in 6 segments, each length \(n=26\).

Segment:

\[
s = \lfloor i / n \rfloor = 2
\]

Offset:

\[
d = i \mod n = 22
\]

Directions in cube coordinates:

\[
d_0 = (1, 0, -1), d_1 = (1, -1, 0), d_2 = (0, -1, 1), d_3 = (-1, 0, 1), d_4 = (-1, 1, 0), d_5 = (0, 1, -1)
\]

---

### Step 43: Calculate position:

\[
pos = start + \sum_{k=0}^{s-1} n \times d_k + d \times d_s
\]

Calculate:

\[
start = (0, -26, 26)
\]

Calculate the partial sums:

- For k=0: \(26 \times d_0 = (26, 0, -26)\)
- For k=1: \(26 \times d_1 = (26, -26, 0)\)

Sum for k=0 and k=1:

\[
(26, 0, -26) + (26, -26, 0) = (52, -26, -26)
\]

Add start:

\[
(0, -26, 26) + (52, -26, -26) = (52, -52, 0)
\]

---

### Step 44: Add offset along \(d_2 = (0, -1, 1)\) times \(d=22\):

\[
22 \times (0, -1, 1) = (0, -22, 22)
\]

Add:

\[
(52, -52, 0) + (0, -22, 22) = (52, -74, 22)
\]

---

### Step 45: Calculate distance:

\[
|x| = 52, |y|=74, |z|=22
\]

Distance:

\[
\max(52, 74, 22) = 74
\]

Expected ring number is 26, but we got distance 74.

---

### Step 46: Problem with indexing

The problem is: indexing from 0 at start of ring at \((0, -n, n)\) for ring \(n\), each segment length \(n\).

Cell 1 in ring \(n\) is at \((0, -n, n)\).

Cell 2 in ring \(n\) is at \((1, -n, n-1)\).

So the step direction uses segments:

- dir0 \(=\) (1, 0, -1)
- dir1 = (1, -1, 0), etc.

---

### Step 47: Direct formula for number at coordinate

The position in ring \(n\) with coordinates:

- side length \(n\),
- offset \(o\) along a side from 0 to \(n-1\),
- side \(s\) in [0..5]:

Number:

\[
N = 3n(n-1) + 2 + s \times n + o
\]

---

### Step 48: Inverse: given number \(N\) in ring \(n\), compute \(s\) and \(o\):

\[
h = N - (3n(n-1) + 2)
\]

Then:

\[
s = \lfloor h / n \rfloor
\]
\[
o = h \mod n
\]

---

### Step 49: Apply for \(N=2026\), \(n=26\).

Calculate \(3n(n-1) + 2\):

\[
3 \times 26 \times 25 + 2 = 3 \times 650 + 2 = 1952
\]

Calculate \(h\):

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

Calculate segment and offset:

\[
s = \lfloor 74 / 26 \rfloor = 2, \quad o = 74 \mod 26 = 22
\]

---

### Step 50: Directions in cube coordinates for sides:

- side 0: direction vector \((1, -1, 0)\)
- side 1: \((0, -1, 1)\)
- side 2: \((-1, 0, 1)\)
- side 3: \((-1, 1, 0)\)
- side 4: \((0, 1, -1)\)
- side 5: \((1, 0, -1)\)

Starting point of ring \(n\) (position at cell 1 in ring \(n\)):

\[
start = (0, -n, n) = (0, -26, 26)
\]

---

### Step 51: Calculate coordinate of \(N=2026\):

\[
pos = start + s \times side\_vector \times n + o \times side\_vector
\]

Wait, not multiplying side vector by \(n\) for segment step, but only using:

\[
pos = start + s \times side\_vector \times n + o \times step\_vector
\]

This is inconsistent. Likely the side vector defines the direction around ring and the step vector is the step on the side.

Actually, side 0 is from start, then offset along direction perpendicular to side 0.

---

### Step 52: Final construction:

1. Start point = \(P_0 = (0, -n, n)\)
2. The ring is composed of 6 sides.
3. Each side has \(n\) cells.
4. The six corner points of ring \(n\) are:

- \(C_0 = (0, -n, n)\)
- \(C_1 = (n, -n, 0)\)
- \(C_2 = (n, 0, -n)\)
- \(C_3 = (0, n, -n)\)
- \(C_4 = (-n, n, 0)\)
- \(C_5 = (-n, 0, n)\)

Sides are segments between these corners from \(C_k\) to \(C_{k+1 \pmod 6}\).

---

### Step 53: Calculate the position of cell within ring:

\[
pos = C_s + o \times (C_{s+1} - C_s)/n
\]

For \(s=2\), \(o=22\).

Calculate:

\[
C_2 = (n, 0, -n) = (26, 0, -26)
\]
\[
C_3 = (0, n, -n) = (0, 26, -26)
\]

Vector from \(C_2\) to \(C_3\):

\[
(0 - 26, 26 - 0, -26 + 26) = (-26, 26, 0)
\]

Unit step vector along side 2:

\[
\frac{1}{n} (-26, 26, 0) = (-1, 1, 0)
\]

Multiply by \(o = 22\):

\[
22 \times (-1, 1, 0) = (-22, 22, 0)
\]

Add to \(C_2\):

\[
(26, 0, -26) + (-22, 22, 0) = (4, 22, -26)
\]

---

### Step 54: Validate hex distance:

\[
d = \max(|4|, |22|, |-4 - 22 -(-26)|)
\]

Calculate \(z = -x - y\):

Here:

\[
x = 4, y=22
\]
\[
z = -4 - 22 = -26
\]

Distances:

\[
|4|=4, |22|=22, | -26|=26
\]

Distance \(=26\) = ring number, consistent!

---

### Step 55: Position of cell 2026 is cube coords:

\[
(4, 22, -26)
\]

---

### Step 56: Find the neighbors of this cell

Neighbors are:

\[
(4, 22, -26) +
\]
\[
\{
(1, -1, 0), (1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1), (0, -1, 1)
\}
\]

Calculate neighbors:

1. \((4+1, 22-1, -26+0) = (5, 21, -26)\)
2. \((4+1, 22+0, -26-1) = (5, 22, -27)\)
3. \((4+0, 22+1, -26-1) = (4, 23, -27)\)
4. \((4-1, 22+1, -26+0) = (3, 23, -26)\)
5. \((4-1, 22+0, -26+1) = (3, 22, -25)\)
6. \((4+0, 22-1, -26+1) = (4, 21, -25)\)

---

### Step 57: Convert neighbors back to numbers

For each neighbor:

1. Compute distance \(n\), ring number:
\[
n = \max(|x|, |y|, |z|)
\]
2. If \(n=0\), number is 1.
3. If \(n > 0\):

\[
\text{base} = 3n(n-1) + 2
\]

4. Identify the side \(s\) and offset \(o\) on ring \(n\).

---

### Step 58: Compute distance and ring for each neighbor:

| Neighbor | (x,y,z) | \(|x|\) | \(|y|\) | \(|z|\) | \(n\) |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | (5, 21, -26) | 5 | 21 | 26 | 26 |
| 2 | (5, 22, -27) | 5 | 22 | 27 | 27 |
| 3 | (4, 23, -27) | 4 | 23 | 27 | 27 |
| 4 | (3, 23, -26) | 3 | 23 | 26 | 26 |
| 5 | (3, 22, -25) | 3 | 22 | 25 | 25 |
| 6 | (4, 21, -25) | 4 | 21 | 25 | 25 |

---

### Step 59: Calculate number for neighbors with \(n>0\):

Formula for ring \(n\):

\[
\text{base} = 3n(n-1) + 2
\]

Find side \(s\) and offset \(o\) such that:

\[
N = \text{base} + s \times n + o
\]

---

### Step 60: Calculate neighbors one by one

---

#### Neighbor 1: (5, 21, -26), \(n=26\)

- Find corner points \(C_0\) to \(C_5\) for \(n=26\) (from Step 52).
- Corner points:

\[
C_0 = (0, -26, 26)
\]
\[
C_1 = (26, -26, 0)
\]
\[
C_2 = (26, 0, -26)
\]
\[
C_3 = (0, 26, -26)
\]
\[
C_4 = (-26, 26, 0)
\]
\[
C_5 = (-26, 0, 26)
\]

We check on which side the neighbor lies.

Calculate vectors from corners:

- \(d_{0,1} = C_1 - C_0 = (26 - 0, -26 + 26, 0 - 26) = (26, 0, -26)\)

- \(d_{1,2} = (0, 26, -26)\) etc.

Check which side contains \((5,21,-26)\):

Side 2 is between \(C_2=(26,0,-26)\) and \(C_3=(0,26,-26)\).

Vector between corners:

\[
(0 - 26, 26 - 0, -26 + 26) = (-26, 26, 0)
\]

Vector from \(C_2\) to neighbor:

\[
(5 - 26, 21 - 0, -26 + 26) = (-21, 21, 0)
\]

Coordinates proportional to side vector \((-26, 26, 0)\):

Check offset ratio:

\[
o = \frac{|-21|}{26} = 0.8077
\]

Since o is between 0 and 1, neighbor 1 lies on side 2, offset:

\[
o_{\text{steps}} = 0.8077 \times 26 \approx 21
\]

(since integer coordinates we expect integer offset)

Use o=21.

Calculate number:

\[
N = base + s \times n + o = (3 \times 26 \times 25 + 2) + 2 \times 26 + 21 = 1952 + 52 + 21 = 2025
\]

---

#### Neighbor 2: (5, 22, -27), \(n=27\)

Calculate base:

\[
3 \times 27 \times 26 + 2 = 3 \times 702 + 2 = 2108
\]

Check which side.

Corners for \(n=27\):

\[
C_0 = (0, -27, 27)
\]
\[
C_1 = (27, -27, 0)
\]
\[
C_2 = (27, 0, -27)
\]
\[
C_3 = (0, 27, -27)
\]
\[
C_4 = (-27, 27, 0)
\]
\[
C_5 = (-27, 0, 27)
\]

Check side 2 between \(C_2\) and \(C_3\):

\[
d_{2,3} = C_3 - C_2 = (0 - 27, 27 - 0, -27 + 27) = (-27, 27, 0)
\]

Neighbor offset:

\[
(5 - 27, 22 - 0, -27 + 27) = (-22, 22, 0)
\]

Offset ratio:

\[
\frac{22}{27} \approx 0.8148
\]

Offset steps:

\[
o = \text{round}(0.8148 \times 27) = 22
\]

Neighbor lies on side 2, offset 22.

Calculate neighbor number:

\[
N = 2108 + 2 \times 27 + 22 = 2108 + 54 + 22 = 2184
\]

---

#### Neighbor 3: (4, 23, -27), \(n=27\)

Vector from \(C_2\):

\[
(4-27, 23-0, -27+27) = (-23, 23, 0)
\]

Offset ratio:

\[
23 / 27 = 0.8518
\]

Offset steps:

\[
22.9 \to 23
\]

Neighbor number:

\[
N = 2108 + 2 \times 27 + 23 = 2185
\]

---

#### Neighbor 4: (3, 23, -26), \(n=26\)

Side 3 between \(C_3 = (0, 26, -26)\) and \(C_4 = (-26, 26, 0)\):

Vector:

\[
(-26 - 0, 26 - 26, 0 + 26) = (-26, 0, 26)
\]

Neighbor vector from \(C_3\):

\[
(3 - 0, 23 - 26, -26 + 26) = (3, -3, 0)
\]

Not aligned with side vector (proportional proportions not equal), check side 2 same as before:

Neighbor vector from \(C_2=(26,0,-26)\):

\[
(3 - 26, 23 - 0, -26 + 26) = (-23,23,0)
\]

This belongs to side 2, offset ~23 (see neighbor 3).

Distance: 26 means base = 1952.

Neighbor number:

\[
1952 + 2 \times 26 + 23 = 1952 + 52 + 23 = 2027
\]

---

#### Neighbor 5: (3, 22, -25), \(n=25\)

Base:

\[
3 \times 25 \times 24 + 2 = 3 \times 600 + 2 = 1802
\]

Check side \(s\) and offset \(o\).

Check side 2 between:

\[
C_2 = (25, 0, -25)
\]
and
\[
C_3 = (0, 25, -25)
\]

Vector:

\[
(-25, 25, 0)
\]

Neighbor vector:

\[
(3-25, 22-0, -25+25) = (-22, 22, 0)
\]

Proportion:

\[
22/25 = 0.88
\]

Offset:

\[
0.88 \times 25 = 22
\]

Neighbor number:

\[
1802 + 2 \times 25 + 22 = 1802 + 50 + 22 = 1874
\]

---

#### Neighbor 6: (4, 21, -25), \(n=25\)

Vector from \(C_2\):

\[
(4-25, 21-0, -25+25) = (-21, 21, 0)
\]

Offset:

\[
21/25 = 0.84
\]

Offset steps: 21

Neighbor number:

\[
1802 + 2 \times 25 + 21 = 1802 + 50 + 21 = 1873
\]

---

### Step 61: Final neighbor numbers:

| Neighbor | Number |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 2025 |
| 2 | 2184 |
| 3 | 2185 |
| 4 | 2027 |
| 5 | 1874 |
| 6 | 1873 |

---

### Step 62: Sum neighbors:

\[
2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873
\]

Calculate step by step:

- \(2025 + 2184 = 4209\)
- \(4209 + 2185 = 6394\)
- \(6394 + 2027 = 8421\)
- \(8421 + 1874 = 10295\)
- \(10295 + 1873 = 12168\)

---

### **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

---

# **Summary:**

The sum of all 6 neighbors of number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral is **12168**.
