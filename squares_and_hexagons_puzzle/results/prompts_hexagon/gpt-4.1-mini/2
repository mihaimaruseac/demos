Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

**Problem Summary:**

- Natural numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid in a spiral pattern.
- Example provided:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
 \cdots & 14 & 4 & 3 & 10 & \cdots \\
 \cdots & 15 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 9 & \cdots \\
 \cdots & 16 & 6 & 7 & 8 & \cdots \\
\end{array}
\]

- We want: **sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026.**

---

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Pattern on the Hex Grid

- The number 1 is at the center.
- Around 1, numbers 2 to 7 form the first "ring" or "shell".
- Then numbers 8 to 19 form the second ring, then 20 to ... the third ring, etc.

---

### Step 2: Determine the ring/layer of a number on a hex spiral

Formula for the number of cells in a hex spiral:

- The center ring (ring 0) has 1 cell (number 1).
- Ring 1 has 6 cells (numbers 2 to 7).
- Ring \( n \) has \( 6n \) cells.
- Total cells up to ring \( n \) is:

\[
1 + 6 \times (1 + 2 + \cdots + n) = 1 + 6 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

We want to find the ring number \( r \) such that:

\[
1 + 3r(r+1) \geq 2026 > 1 + 3(r-1)r
\]

Let's solve for \( r \):

\[
3r^2 + 3r + 1 \geq 2026
\]
\[
3r^2 + 3r \geq 2025
\]
\[
r^2 + r \geq 675
\]

Solve quadratic inequality:

\[
r^2 + r - 675 \geq 0
\]

Roots of \( r^2 + r - 675=0 \):

\[
r = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\[
\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97
\]

Positive root:

\[
r \approx \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} = \frac{50.97}{2} = 25.485
\]

So \( r = 26 \) since ring is an integer (ring numbering starts at 0).

Therefore:

- Ring 25 contains numbers up to:

\[
1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

- Ring 26 contains numbers up to:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

So:

- Numbers 1952 to 2107 are in ring 26.
- 2026 is in ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Find the position of 2026 within ring 26

Ring 26 starts with number:

\[
\text{start}_r = 1952
\]

We want the offset of 2026 in ring 26:

\[
\text{offset} = 2026 - 1952 = 74 \quad (\text{0-based})
\]

Ring 26 has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers, number 0 to 155 in this ring.

---

### Step 4: Geometry of hexagonal spiral neighbors

Each hexagonal ring has \(6r\) cells, arranged in 6 segments of length \(r\).

Indexing cells:

- Cell 0: start of ring at some fixed direction (e.g., the cell right of center).
- Cells 0 to 25: segment 0.
- 26 to 51: segment 1.
- 52 to 77: segment 2.
- 78 to 103: segment 3.
- 104 to 129: segment 4.
- 130 to 155: segment 5.

The number 2026 is offset 74 in ring 26.

Which segment?

\[
74 / 26 = 2.846
\]

So segment is 2 (0-based). The index within segment:

\[
74 - 2 \times 26 = 74 - 52 = 22
\]

---

### Step 5: Identify the neighbors of a cell in ring \(r\)

Each cell has (up to) 6 neighbors:

- 2 neighbors in the same ring \(r\): previous and next cell in ring \(r\).
- 1 neighbor in ring \(r-1\).
- 1 neighbor in ring \(r+1\).
- The cell inside ring \(r-1\) is adjacent.
- The cell outside ring \(r+1\) is adjacent.
- Two additional neighbors may be the corresponding neighbors adjacent diagonally.

**Depending on their position in the segment, the neighbors follow a pattern.**

---

### Step 6: Companion cells in rings \(r-1\) and \(r+1\)

- Ring \(r-1\) has \(6(r-1)\) cells.
- Ring \(r+1\) has \(6(r+1)\) cells.

We need the formula for indices of neighbors in these rings.

Reference from known hex ring neighbors (numbered similarly):

- We label the cells in ring \(r\) from 0 to \(6r-1\).
- For a cell \(i\) in ring \(r\), neighbors are:

  - In ring \(r\): \(i-1\) and \(i+1\) (mod \(6r\))
  
  - In ring \(r-1\):
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{i}{r} \right\rfloor \times (r-1) + (i \mod r)
    \]
   
  - and
  
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{i-1}{r} \right\rfloor \times (r-1) + (i-1 \mod r)
    \]
    
  (one or two neighbors depending on \(i \mod r\))

  - In ring \(r+1\):
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{i}{r} \right\rfloor \times (r+1) + (i \mod r)
    \]
    
  - and
  
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{i+1}{r} \right\rfloor \times (r+1) + ((i+1) \mod r)
    \]

---

### Step 7: Calculate the neighbors of 2026

Given:

- \(r = 26\)
- \(i = 74\)
- \(6r = 156\)

---

**Neighbors inside ring 26**:

- \(i-1 = 73\)
- \(i+1 = 75\)

Modulo if necessary (since \(0 \leq i < 156\), no modulo needed here).

---

**Neighbors in ring 25 (r-1 = 25):**

- \(6 \times 25 = 150\) cells in ring 25.

Calculate:

- \(i // r = 74 // 26 = 2\)
- \(i \% r = 74 \% 26 = 22\)

Neighbor 1:

\[
N_1 = 2 \times 25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72
\]

Neighbor 2:

- \(i-1 = 73\)
- \((i-1) // r = 73 // 26 = 2\)
- \((i-1) \% r = 73 \% 26 = 21\)

\[
N_2 = 2 \times 25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71
\]

---

**Neighbors in ring 27 (r+1 = 27):**

- \(6 \times 27 = 162\) cells.

Calculate:

- \(i // r = 2\) (same as above)
- \(i \% r = 22\)

Neighbor 1:

\[
M_1 = 2 \times 27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76
\]

Neighbor 2:

- \(i+1 = 75\)
- \((i+1) // r = 75 // 26 = 2\)
- \((i+1) \% r = 75 \% 26 = 23\)

\[
M_2 = 2 \times 27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77
\]

---

### Step 8: Convert ring index + offset back to absolute number

Recall:

- Start of ring \(r\) is:

\[
\text{start}(r) = 2 \quad \text{if} \quad r=1 \quad \text{(for example?)} 
\]

Check from previous:

\[
\text{start}(r) = 1 + 3(r-1)r + 1 = 2 + 3(r-1)r
\]

Wait, to clarify:

\[
\text{max in ring } r-1 = 1 + 3 \times (r-1) \times r
\]

Ring \(r\) starts at \( \text{max in ring } r-1 + 1 \):

\[
\text{start}(r) = 1 + 3 \times (r-1) \times r + 1 = 2 + 3(r-1)r
\]

Check with \(r=26\):

\[
\text{start}(26) = 2 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 2 + 1950 = 1952
\]

Consistent with previous.

Thus absolute number is:

\[
\text{absolute}(r, i) = \text{start}(r) + i
\]

---

### Step 9: Calculate absolute numbers of neighbors

#### Same ring neighbors:

- \(r=26\)
- \(i=74\) (the original number 2026)
- Neighbors indices: \(73, 75\)
- Start ring 26: 1952

\[
N_{\text{same}} = 1952 + 73 = 2025
\]
\[
N_{\text{same}} = 1952 + 75 = 2027
\]

#### Ring 25 neighbors:

- \(r-1 = 25\)
- Neighbors indices: 71, 72
- Start ring 25:

\[
\text{start}(25) = 2 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 2 + 3 \times 600 = 2 + 1800 = 1802
\]

Neighbors:

\[
N_{25,1} = 1802 + 71 = 1873
\]

\[
N_{25,2} = 1802 + 72 = 1874
\]

#### Ring 27 neighbors:

- \(r+1 = 27\)
- Neighbors indices: 76, 77
- Start ring 27:

\[
\text{start}(27) = 2 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2 + 3 \times 702 = 2 + 2106 = 2108
\]

Neighbors:

\[
N_{27,1} = 2108 + 76 = 2184
\]

\[
N_{27,2} = 2108 + 77 = 2185
\]

---

### Step 10: Sum all 6 neighbors

Neighbors are:

- Ring 26 (same ring): 2025, 2027
- Ring 25: 1873, 1874
- Ring 27: 2184, 2185

Sum:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Calculate step-by-step:

\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052
\]
\[
1873 + 1874 = 3747
\]
\[
2184 + 2185 = 4369
\]

Sum total:

\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799
\]
\[
7799 + 4369 = 12168
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

---

# **Summary:**

- Found ring of 2026: ring 26.
- Found offset in ring.
- Calculated indices of neighbors in rings \(r, r-1, r+1\).
- Converted indices to absolute numbers.
- Added them to get 12168.

---

**So, the sum of all 6 neighbors of number 2026 is 12168.**
