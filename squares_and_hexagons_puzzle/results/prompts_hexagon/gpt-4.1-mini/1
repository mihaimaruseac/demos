We are given a pattern of natural numbers laid out on a hexagonal grid in a spiral:

Example segment:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
..  15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

We want to find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the hexagonal spiral numbering scheme

From the small example, the numbering starts at 1 in the center and spirals outward in rings of hexagons:

- Number 1 is the center.
- The first ring around 1 contains numbers 2 to 7 (6 neighbors).
- The second ring contains numbers 8 to 19 (next 12 numbers).
- The third ring contains numbers 20 to 37 (next 18 numbers).
- ...

The number of cells in the nth ring (n >= 1) is **6 * n**.

---

### Step 2: Identify which ring the number 2026 is in

The total number of elements up to and including the nth ring is:

\[
1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 3 n (n+1)
\]

Because:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

So total cells up to ring n:

\[
1 + 6 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3 n (n+1)
\]

We want to find \(n\) such that:

\[
1 + 3 n (n+1) \geq 2026
\]

and

\[
1 + 3 (n-1) n < 2026
\]

---

Solve \(1 + 3 n (n+1) \geq 2026\):

\[
3 n^2 + 3 n + 1 \geq 2026 \implies 3 n^2 + 3n \geq 2025 \implies n^2 + n \geq 675
\]

Solve quadratic inequality:

\[
n^2 + n -675 \geq 0
\]

The roots of \( n^2 + n -675 = 0 \):

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\[
\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97
\]

Positive root:

\[
n = \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} \approx \frac{50.97}{2} = 25.485
\]

So \(n \geq 26\).

Check rings:

- Up to ring 25:
\[
1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026
\]

- Up to ring 26:
\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \geq 2026
\]

So 2026 lies in ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Position of 2026 within ring 26

- The first number in ring 26 is:

\[
\text{first}_\text{ring26} = 1952 \quad ( = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26)
\]

- The last number in ring 26 is 2107.

So 2026's offset in ring 26 is:

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

Counting from zero (offset 0 corresponds to 1952), the 2026 is the 75th element in the ring (offset 74).

---

### Step 4: Layout of ring 26 on hex grid

A ring has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) cells, arranged as 6 sides with 26 cells each.

Offset 0 = start of ring (side 1, position 0)
Positions on sides:

- Side 1: offsets 0 to 25
- Side 2: offsets 26 to 51
- Side 3: offsets 52 to 77
- Side 4: offsets 78 to 103
- Side 5: offsets 104 to 129
- Side 6: offsets 130 to 155

Our offset 74 lies on **side 3** (offset 52 to 77)

Position along side 3:

\[
74 - 52 = 22
\]

---

### Step 5: The neighbors of a cell in ring n

Each cell has 6 neighbors in a hex grid. For a cell in ring \(n\), neighbors can be in rings \(n-1\), \(n\), or \(n+1\).

From hexagonal spiral theory, neighbors are at:

- The previous and next cell in the same ring \(n\)
- The corresponding two neighbors in the inner ring \(n-1\)
- The corresponding two neighbors in the outer ring \(n+1\)

---

### Step 6: Identifying neighbors for cell at ring 26, offset 74

- Neighbors on the same ring (ring 26):

  - Offset 73 (previous cell)
  - Offset 75 (next cell)

- Inner ring is ring 25:

  - First number in ring 25:

  \[
  1 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 1 + 3 \times 600 = 1801
  \]

  Ring 25 has \(6 \times 25 = 150\) cells.

  We need to find neighbor positions relative to offset 74 in ring 26.

- Outer ring is ring 27:

  - First number in ring 27:

  \[
  1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2107 + 1 = 2108
  \]

  (Wait, we had ring 26 ending at 2107, so ring 27 starts at 2108.)

  Ring 27 has \(6 \times 27 = 162\) cells.

---

### Step 7: Neighbor offset mapping

For an offset \(k\) in ring \(n\) (0 ≤ k < 6n), neighbors indices are:

- Same ring: \((k-1) \mod 6n\), and \((k+1) \mod 6n\)
- Inner ring: two neighbors, the floor and ceiling of \(\frac{k}{n}\) times (n-1):
  
  Let \(side = \lfloor k / n \rfloor\), and \(pos = k \mod n\)

  Then inner ring neighbors' offsets (in ring n-1, with 6(n-1) cells) are:

  \[
  \text{inner1} = side \times (n-1) + pos - 1 \quad (\text{mod } 6(n-1))
  \]
  \[
  \text{inner2} = side \times (n-1) + pos \quad (\text{mod } 6(n-1))
  \]

- Outer ring: two neighbors for each cell similarly:

  \[
  \text{outer1} = side \times (n+1) + pos \quad (\text{mod } 6(n+1))
  \]
  \[
  \text{outer2} = side \times (n+1) + pos + 1 \quad (\text{mod } 6(n+1))
  \]

Double-checking if \(pos - 1\) is valid (negative) we use modulo.

Let's apply this to \(n=26\), \(k=74\).

---

### Step 8: Calculate \(side\) and \(pos\)

\[
side = \lfloor \frac{74}{26} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.846 \rfloor = 2
\]
\[
pos = 74 \mod 26 = 74 - 2 \times 26 = 74 - 52 = 22
\]

---

### Step 9: Calculate neighbors offsets

- **Same ring neighbors:**

\[
k_{prev} = (74 - 1) \mod 156 = 73
\]
\[
k_{next} = (74 + 1) \mod 156 = 75
\]

- **Inner ring neighbors:**

Ring 25 has \(6 \times 25 = 150\) cells.

\[
inner1 = (side \times 25) + (pos - 1) = 2 \times 25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71
\]
\[
inner2 = (side \times 25) + pos = 2 \times 25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72
\]

Check that 0 ≤ inner1, inner2 < 150; yes.

- **Outer ring neighbors:**

Ring 27 has \(6 \times 27 = 162\) cells.

\[
outer1 = (side \times 27) + pos = 2 \times 27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76
\]
\[
outer2 = (side \times 27) + (pos + 1) = 54 + 23 = 77
\]

Check 0 ≤ outer1, outer2 < 162; yes.

---

### Step 10: Convert neighbor offsets back to absolute numbers

- Ring 26 starts at 1952 (offset 0).
- Ring 25 starts at 1801.
- Ring 27 starts at 2108.

Neighbors:

- In ring 26 (same ring):

\[
1952 + 73 = 2025
\]
\[
1952 + 75 = 2027
\]

- In ring 25 (inner ring):

\[
1801 + 71 = 1872
\]
\[
1801 + 72 = 1873
\]

- In ring 27 (outer ring):

\[
2108 + 76 = 2184
\]
\[
2108 + 77 = 2185
\]

---

### Step 11: Sum all 6 neighbors

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Calculate stepwise:

\[
(2025 + 2027) = 4052
\]
\[
(1872 + 1873) = 3745
\]
\[
(2184 + 2185) = 4369
\]

Sum all:

\[
4052 + 3745 + 4369 = 4052 + (3745 + 4369) = 4052 + 8114 = 12166
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12166}
\]

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12166**.
