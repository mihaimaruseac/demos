We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid.

Given the example:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

From this, the number 1 is at the center. The numbers spiral outwards layer-by-layer on a hexagonal grid.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral Layout

The number 1 is at the center. The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The next ring would be numbers 8 and onwards. The spiral proceeds in rings:

- Ring 0: number 1  
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers on the first ring)  
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)  
- Ring 3: numbers 20 to 37 (18 numbers)  
- and so on...

Number of cells in each ring \( k \) (where ring 0 is the center) is:
\[
  6k
\]

Numbering scheme:
- Total numbers up to ring \( k \) (including the center and all rings up to \( k \)) is:
\[
  1 + 6(1 + 2 + \cdots + k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

---

### Step 2: Find the ring in which number 2026 lies

We want \( k \) such that:
\[
1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026
\]
and
\[
1 + 3(k-1)k < 2026
\]

Solve inequality for \( k \):
\[
3k^2 + 3k + 1 \geq 2026
\Rightarrow 3k^2 + 3k \geq 2025
\Rightarrow k^2 + k \geq 675
\]

Solve quadratic:
\[
k^2 + k - 675 = 0
\]
\[
k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97\), thus:
\[
k \approx \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} \approx \frac{50.97}{2} = 25.49
\]

Since ring index must be integer, \(k=25\) is too small (sum up to ring 25 is less than 2026), and 26 is too large.

Check ring 25:
\[
1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026
\]

Check ring 26:
\[
1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \geq 2026
\]

So number 2026 lies in ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Find the position of 2026 in ring 26

The first number in ring 26 is one more than the last number in ring 25:
\[
\text{last number ring 25} = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1951
\]
Thus,
\[
\text{start number ring 26} = 1952
\]

Number 2026's zero-based index in ring 26 is:
\[
2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

---

### Step 4: Hexagonal Spiral Ring Layout Details

Each ring \( k \) has \(6k\) cells.

Ring 26 has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) numbers.

These cells form 6 segments (edges), each with \(k = 26\) cells.

Index 0-25: first segment, 26-51: second segment, etc.

Index 74 lies in which segment?

\[
\text{segment} = \lfloor 74 / 26 \rfloor = \lfloor 2.846 \rfloor = 2
\]
Index in segment:
\[
74 \mod 26 = 74 - 2 \times 26 = 74 - 52 = 22
\]

So number 2026 is the 23rd cell (index 22) in segment 3 (we count segments from 0). 

---

### Step 5: Neighbors of a cell in ring \( k \)

Each cell has 6 neighbors:
- 2 or 3 neighbors lie in the same ring \( k \).
- Some neighbors lie in ring \( k-1 \) (inner ring).
- Some neighbors lie in ring \( k+1 \) (outer ring).

The structure is complicated but is known from hexagonal spiral numbering.

**Key facts:**

In ring \( k \), cell \( n \) (0-based index):

- Has neighbors in ring \( k \):
  - previous and next cell: \( n-1 \) and \( n+1 \), modulo \( 6k \).

- Neighbor in ring \( k-1 \):
  - a cell in ring \( k-1 \) associated with the "inner" neighbor.

- Neighbor(s) in ring \( k+1 \):
  - cells in ring \( k+1 \) "outside" the cell.

We use formulas from hex spiral logic detailed in various works (like the Ulam hex spiral).

---

### Step 6: Calculate numbers of neighbors

Let’s define:

- \(k = 26\),
- \(n = 74\) zero-based index within ring 26,
- \(n_s = 22\) zero-based index within segment 2 of ring 26 (segment indices 0 to 5).

---

### Step 7: Ring boundaries and numbering

- Ring \(k\) starts at number:
\[
S(k) = 2 + 3(k-1)k
\]
(since ring 1 starts at 2)

Check for ring 26:
\[
S(26) = 2 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 2 + 1950 = 1952
\]
matches earlier.

Number of cells in ring \(k\):
\[
6k
\]

---

### Step 8: Identify neighboring numbers

We define:

- Neighbor in same ring \(k\):
  - \(n_{prev} = (n-1) \mod 6k = (74-1) \mod 156 = 73\)
  - \(n_{next} = (n+1) \mod 6k = (74+1) \mod 156 = 75\)
  
Corresponding numbers:
\[
\text{neighbor same ring } = S(k) + n_{prev} = 1952 + 73 = 2025
\]
\[
\text{neighbor same ring } = S(k) + n_{next} = 1952 + 75 = 2027
\]

---

### Step 9: Compute neighbors in rings \(k-1\) and \(k+1\)

- Ring \(k-1 = 25\):
  - starts at:
  \[
  S(25) = 2 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 2 + 1800 = 1802
  \]
  - length: 150 cells
  
- Ring \(k+1 = 27\):
  - starts at:
  \[
  S(27) = 2 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2 + 2106 = 2108
  \]
  - length: 162 cells

---

### Step 10: Relating index \(n\) in ring \(k\) to neighbors in rings \(k-1\) and \(k+1\)

Each ring is divided into 6 segments with \(k\) cells each.

Cell \( n \) belongs to segment \( s = \lfloor n/k \rfloor \),

and position within segment \( p = n \mod k \).

For ring \(k = 26\):
\[
n = 74, s = 2, p = 22
\]

---

### Step 11: Find neighboring positions in ring \(k-1\)

Ring \(k-1 = 25\), length 150, segment size 25.

Segment \(s\) index same as in ring \(k\) because the spiral corresponds segment by segment.

Neighbors in ring \(k-1\):

- On the "inner ring", the neighbors are at positions \(p\) (same index in segment) and \(p-1\) (previous index), with wrap-around.

- For \(p=22\), the neighbors in ring \(k-1\) segment \(s=2\) are positions:
  - \(p = 22\)
  - \(p-1 = 21\)

If \(p=0\), then \(p-1\) is the last in the segment.

Convert these to global indices in ring \(k-1\):
\[
n_{k-1,1} = s \times (k-1) + p = 2 \times 25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72
\]
\[
n_{k-1,2} = s \times (k-1) + (p-1) = 2 \times 25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71
\]

Corresponding numbers:
\[
S(k-1) + n_{k-1,1} = 1802 + 72 = 1874
\]
\[
S(k-1) + n_{k-1,2} = 1802 + 71 = 1873
\]

---

### Step 12: Neighbors in ring \(k+1\)

Ring \(k+1=27\), length 162, segment size 27.

Neighbors occur in ring \(k+1\) at segment \(s\) and \(s+1 \mod 6\) with some positions \(p\) and \(p+1\).

The formula for \(k+1\) neighbors is:

Positions in segment \(s\):
\[
p \quad \text{and} \quad p+1
\]

Positions in segment \(s+1 \mod 6\):
\[
p \quad \text{and possibly } p+1
\]

However, for a cell not on a corner, the 2 neighbors in \(k+1\) ring are:

- Segment \(s\), position \(p\)
- Segment \(s+1\), position \(p\)

Using this logic:

Segment \(s=2\) and \(s+1=3\)

Positions \(p=22\)

Convert to global index in ring \(k+1 = 27\), segment size 27:

For segment 2:
\[
n_{k+1,1} = 2 \times 27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76
\]

For segment 3:
\[
n_{k+1,2} = 3 \times 27 + 22 = 81 + 22 = 103
\]

Corresponding numbers:
\[
S(k+1) + n_{k+1,1} = 2108 + 76 = 2184
\]
\[
S(k+1) + n_{k+1,2} = 2108 + 103 = 2211
\]

---

### Step 13: Summary of neighbors

Neighbors of number 2026 are (6 neighbors total):

- Same ring:  
  - \(2025\) (index 73)  
  - \(2027\) (index 75)  

- Ring \(k-1=25\):  
  - \(1873\) (n=71)  
  - \(1874\) (n=72)  

- Ring \(k+1=27\):  
  - \(2184\) (n=76)  
  - \(2211\) (n=103)  

---

### Step 14: Calculate the sum of neighbors

Sum:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2211
\]
Calculate stepwise:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(2184 + 2211 = 4395\)

Sum:
\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799
\]
\[
7799 + 4395 = 12194
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12194}
\]
