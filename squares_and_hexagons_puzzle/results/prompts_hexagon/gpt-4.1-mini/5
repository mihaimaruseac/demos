We have a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral pattern. The problem gives a small portion of the layout:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
...16  6  7  8 ...
```

We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pattern

From the partial layout, we see 1 at the center (reference point), surrounded by rings of numbers expanding in a hexagonal spiral.

This hexagonal spiral arrangement is a well-studied pattern.

- The center cell is 1.
- The first "ring" around it is numbers 2 through 7.
- The second ring is 8 through 19.
- The third ring 20 through ... and so on.

---

### Step 2: Identify the ring number of 2026

Each "ring" is a hexagonal ring around the center.

- Number of cells in ring \( n \) (with ring 0 = center cell): \( 6n \),
- Total number of cells up to and including ring \( n \):

\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + \dots + n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

Sum of first \( n \) natural numbers: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) so 

\[
1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1).
\]

Thus, the max number in ring \( n \) is

\[
M(n) = 1 + 3 n (n+1).
\]

We want \(n\) such that

\[
M(n-1) < 2026 \le M(n),
\]

where \(M(n-1) = 1 + 3 (n-1) n\).

Try to find \(n\):

\[
1 + 3 n (n+1) \ge 2026,
\]
\[
3 n^2 + 3 n + 1 \ge 2026,
\]
\[
3 n^2 + 3 n \ge 2025,
\]
\[
n^2 + n \ge 675.
\]

Solve quadratic inequality:

\[
n^2 + n - 675 \ge 0,
\]
\[
n = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675} }{2} = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{2701} }{2}.
\]

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96\),

\[
n = \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} \approx \frac{50.96}{2} = 25.48.
\]

So ring \( n=26 \) includes 2026, since \( n=25 \) ring max is less than 2026.

---

### Step 3: Determine the starting and ending numbers in ring 26

- Max number up to ring 25:

\[
M(25) = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951.
\]

- Max number up to ring 26:

\[
M(26) = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107.
\]

So ring 26 contains numbers from 1952 up to 2107.

---

### Step 4: Structure of a ring

Each ring \( n \) has \( 6n \) cells, arranged in 6 segments of length \( n \) each.

- Ring 26 has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers.
- Starting number for ring 26: \( S = 1952 \),
- Ending number for ring 26: 2107.

---

### Step 5: Locating the number 2026 in the ring 26

Index of 2026 in ring 26:

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74,
\]

zero-based index: 74 (counting from 0 to 155).

This means the 75th cell in ring 26.

---

### Step 6: Identify neighbors

Each cell in ring \( n \) has 6 neighbors:

- Some neighbors are in the same ring,
- Some neighbors are in the inner ring,
- Some neighbors are in the outer ring.

Neighbors of a cell on ring \( n \) number \( k \) (0-based in ring \( n \)):

- Two neighbors in ring \( n \) (previous and next cell on ring \( n \))
- Two neighbors in ring \( n-1 \) (in the inner ring)
- Two neighbors in ring \( n+1 \) (in the outer ring)

---

### Step 7: Define notation for neighbors

- The rings start from \( n=0 \) with a single cell (number 1),
- For ring \( n \):

  - Total cells: \( c_n = 6n \),
  - Indices: \( k = 0, \dots, c_n - 1 \),
  - Number in ring \( n, k \) is:

\[
N(n, k) = M(n-1) + 1 + k = (1 + 3 (n-1) n) + 1 + k = 2 + 3 (n-1) n + k,
\]
for \(n \ge 1\).

Check for \( n=1 \):

\[
M(0) = 1,
\]
\[
N(1, 0) = 2 + 3 (0)(1) + 0 = 2,
\]
which matches 2, the first cell on ring 1.

---

### Step 8: Neighbors on ring \( n \)

- Same ring neighbors:

\[
k_{prev} = (k - 1) \mod c_n,
\]
\[
k_{next} = (k + 1) \mod c_n.
\]

---

### Step 9: Neighbors in inner ring (\( n-1 \))

- Ring \( n-1 \) has \( c_{n-1} = 6(n-1) \) cells.

Each cell \( k \) on ring \( n \) touches two cells on ring \( n-1 \).

Because the cells are arranged evenly, neighbors are:

\[
i = \lfloor k \times \frac{c_{n-1}}{c_n} \rfloor,
\]
or precisely (since cells are arranged equally) neighbors on \( n-1 \) at indices:

\[
i_1 = \lfloor \frac{k}{n} \rfloor \cdot (n-1) + (k \mod (n-1)) \quad \text{or similar}.
\]

But better to consider the geometry.

But an easier approach is to use a known formula for hex rings:

Neighbor indices in inner ring for cell \( k \) on ring \( n \) (with 0-based indexing):

- Two neighbors on inner ring with indices:

\[
i_1 = \lfloor \frac{k}{n} \rfloor \times (n-1) + (k \mod n),
\]
and

\[
i_2 = i_1 - 1 \mod c_{n-1}.
\]

Similarly for outer ring neighbors.

This is known from hexagonal spiral neighbor calculations, taking into account the hex spiral arrangement:

- Ring \( n \) divided into 6 segments, each with \( n \) cells,
- Ring \( n-1 \) divided into 6 segments, each with \( n-1 \) cells.

For cell \( k \):

- Segment number

\[
s = \lfloor \frac{k}{n} \rfloor,
\]
- Offset inside segment

\[
o = k \mod n.
\]

Neighbors on inner ring \( n-1 \) (length \( 6(n-1) \)):

- One neighbor index:

\[
j_1 = 6 (s) \cdot (n-1) + \min(o, n-2),
\]

- The other neighbor index is \( j_1 - 1 \mod c_{n-1} \).

Similarly for outer ring \( n+1 \) neighbors.

---

### Step 10: Compute neighbors for 2026 (on ring 26)

Parameters:

- \( n = 26 \),
- \( c_n = 156 \),
- \( k = 74 \).

Calculate segment and offset:

\[
s = \lfloor \frac{74}{26} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.84 \rfloor = 2,
\]
\[
o = 74 \mod 26 = 74 - 2 \times 26 = 74 - 52 = 22.
\]

---

### Step 11: Neighbors on ring 26

- Previous:

\[
k_{prev} = (74 - 1) \mod 156 = 73,
\]

- Next:

\[
k_{next} = (74 + 1) \mod 156 = 75.
\]

These are neighbors in ring 26.

---

### Step 12: Neighbors on the inner ring (ring 25)

- \( n-1 = 25 \),
- \( c_{n-1} = 6 \times 25 = 150 \),
- Segment length in inner ring = 25.

Calculate \(j_1\), the first inner neighbor:

\[
j_1 = 25 \times s + \min(o, 24),
\]
\[
j_1 = 25 \times 2 + \min(22, 24) = 50 + 22 = 72.
\]

The second inner neighbor is:

\[
j_2 = (j_1 - 1) \mod 150 = (72 - 1) = 71.
\]

So inner neighbors are at indices 72 and 71 in ring 25.

---

### Step 13: Neighbors on the outer ring (ring 27)

- \( n+1 = 27 \),
- \( c_{n+1} = 6 \times 27 = 162 \),
- Segment length = 27.

For outer ring neighbors:

Neighbor indices:

- First outer neighbor:

\[
m_1 = 27 \times s + o = 27 \times 2 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76,
\]

- Second outer neighbor:

\[
m_2 = (m_1 + 1) \mod 162 = 77.
\]

---

### Step 14: Calculate neighbor numbers for ring 25 and 27

Recall:

\[
N(n, k) = 2 + 3(n-1) n + k,
\]

For ring 25:

\[
N(25, k) = 2 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 + k = 2 + 1800 + k = 1802 + k.
\]

For ring 25 neighbors:

- \( N(25, 72) = 1802 + 72 = 1874 \),
- \( N(25, 71) = 1802 + 71 = 1873 \).

---

For ring 27:

\[
N(27, k) = 2 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 + k = 2 + 3 \times 702 + k = 2 + 2106 + k = 2108 + k.
\]

For ring 27 neighbors:

- \( N(27, 76) = 2108 + 76 = 2184 \),
- \( N(27, 77) = 2108 + 77 = 2185 \).

---

### Step 15: Neighbors on the same ring (26):

\[
N(26, 73) = 2 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 + 73 = 2 + 1950 + 73 = 2025,
\]
\[
N(26, 75) = 2 + 1950 + 75 = 2027.
\]

---

### Step 16: List of neighbors:

\[
\{2025, 2027, 1874, 1873, 2184, 2185\}.
\]

Sum:

\[
= 2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185.
\]

Add in pairs:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\),
- \(1874 + 1873 = 3747\),
- \(2184 + 2185 = 4369\).

Sum all:

\[
4052 + 3747 + 4369 = (4052 + 3747) + 4369 = 7799 + 4369 = 12168.
\]

---

### **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12168**.
