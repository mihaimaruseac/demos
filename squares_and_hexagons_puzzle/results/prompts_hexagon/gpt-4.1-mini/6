We are given a hexagonal spiral numbering of natural numbers where the numbers are placed on a hexagonal grid in a spiral pattern starting from 1 at the center.

The partial spiral given:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
...16  6  7  8 ...
```

We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on this hexagonal spiral.

---

### Step 1: Understand the hexagonal spiral structure and coordinate system

The hexagonal spiral places numbers starting with 1 at the center, then proceeds in rings around the center:

- Ring 0: 1 (the center)
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 20 to 37 (18 numbers)
- Ring \( n \): numbers from \( 3n(n-1)+2 \) to \( 3n(n+1)+1 \)
  - Number of elements in ring \( n \) is \( 6n \)
  - Total numbers up to ring \( n \) is \( 1 + 6(1 + 2 + \dots + n) = 1 + 3n(n+1) \)
  
---

### Step 2: Determine which ring number 2026 lies in

The total count of numbers from rings 0 through \( n \) is

\[
T(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

We want to find \( n \) such that

\[
T(n-1) < 2026 \le T(n)
\]

Evaluate \( T(n) \) for some values:

- \( T(25) = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \)
- \( T(26) = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \)

Since \( 1951 < 2026 \le 2107 \), 2026 lies on ring 26.

---

### Step 3: Find the position of 2026 in ring 26

The first number of ring 26 is

\[
F_{26} = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1951
\]

The last number of ring 26 is

\[
T(26) = 2107
\]

Positions in ring 26 go from 1 to \(6 \times 26 = 156\). The position of 2026 in ring 26 is:

\[
p = 2026 - 1951 + 1 = 76
\]

---

### Step 4: Find the neighbors of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral

On each ring \( n \), the 6 neighbors of a number \( x \) consist of:

- 2 neighbors in the same ring \( n \) (the preceding and succeeding numbers modulo ring length)
- 2 neighbors in the inner ring \( n - 1 \) (closest to \( x \))
- 2 neighbors in the outer ring \( n + 1 \)

---

### Step 5: Detail the hexagonal coordinate system and indexing neighbors

Vertices on ring \( n \), indexed from 1 to \( 6n \).

- Each ring has \( 6n \) elements.
- The six vertices dividing the ring into six segments of length \( n \) are at positions:
  
  \[
  k n, \quad k = 1, 2, \dots, 6
  \]

---

### Step 6: Important indexing formulas for neighbors of element \( p \) on ring \( n \)

- Same ring neighbors:

\[
p_{prev} = (p - 2) \mod 6n + 1
\]
\[
p_{next} = p \mod 6n + 1
\]

- Inner ring neighbors:

For ring \( n-1 \), size \( 6(n-1) \), neighbors are approximately at positions

\[
\lceil \frac{p}{n} (n-1) \rceil \text{ and } \lceil \frac{p}{n} (n-1) \rceil + 1
\]

- Outer ring neighbors:

For ring \( n+1 \), size \( 6(n+1) \), neighbors are approximately at positions

\[
\lfloor \frac{p}{n} (n+1) \rfloor \text{ and } \lfloor \frac{p}{n} (n+1) \rfloor + 1
\]

---

### Step 7: Compute the neighbors indices for \( p=76 \), \( n=26 \)

- Ring 26 has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) elements

--- Same ring neighbors ---

\[
p_{prev} = (76 - 2) \mod 156 + 1 = 74 + 1 = 75
\]
\[
p_{next} = 76 \mod 156 + 1 = 76 + 1 = 77
\]

Neighbors in ring 26: 75 and 77

---

### Step 8: Inner ring neighbors for \( n-1 = 25 \)

Ring 25 has \( 6 \times 25 = 150 \) elements.

Compute:

\[
q = \left\lceil \frac{p}{n} (n-1) \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{76}{26} \times 25 \right\rceil
\]

Calculate the fraction:

\[
\frac{76}{26} \times 25 = \frac{76 \times 25}{26} = \frac{1900}{26} \approx 73.08
\]

So inner neighbors are at positions 73 and 74 on ring 25.

---

### Step 9: Outer ring neighbors for \( n+1 = 27 \)

Ring 27 has \( 6 \times 27 = 162 \) elements.

Compute:

\[
r = \left\lfloor \frac{p}{n} (n+1) \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{76}{26} \times 27 \right\rfloor
\]

Calculate:

\[
\frac{76}{26} \times 27 = \frac{76 \times 27}{26} = \frac{2052}{26} = 78.92
\]

So outer neighbors are at positions 78 and 79 on ring 27.

---

### Step 10: Find the actual numbers of those neighbors

General formula for first number of ring \( m \):

\[
F_m = 1 + 3 (m-1) m
\]

We can use this to find exact numbers at given positions:

\[
\text{Number at ring } m, \text{ position } s = F_m + s - 1
\]

For each ring:

- Ring 25: \( F_{25} = 1 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801 \)
- Ring 26: \( F_{26} = 1951 \) (already calculated)
- Ring 27: \( F_{27} = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \)

Compute neighbors:

- Same ring neighbors (ring 26, positions 75, 77):

\[
N_{75} = 1951 + 75 - 1 = 1951 + 74 = 2025
\]

\[
N_{77} = 1951 + 77 - 1 = 1951 + 76 = 2027
\]

- Inner ring neighbors (ring 25, positions 73, 74):

\[
N_{73} = 1801 + 73 - 1 = 1801 + 72 = 1873
\]

\[
N_{74} = 1801 + 74 - 1 = 1801 + 73 = 1874
\]

- Outer ring neighbors (ring 27, positions 78, 79):

\[
N_{78} = 2107 + 78 - 1 = 2107 + 77 = 2184
\]

\[
N_{79} = 2107 + 79 - 1 = 2107 + 78 = 2185
\]

---

### Step 11: Sum all 6 neighbors

Sum:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Group and sum:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(2184 + 2185 = 4369\)

Total sum:

\[
4052 + 3747 + 4369 = (4052 + 3747) + 4369 = 7799 + 4369 = 12168
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12168**.
