We have a hexagonal grid with natural numbers spiraling outward:

Given partial layout near 1:

```
... 14  4   3  10 ...
..  15  5   1   2  9 ...
... 16  6   7   8 ...
```

We need to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Hexagonal Spiral Numbering

The numbering starts at the center with 1, surrounded by layers of hexagonal rings:

- Ring 0: 1 (center)
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20 to 37 (18 numbers)
- Ring \(k\): \(6k\) numbers on ring \(k\)
  
Number of numbers from center up to and including ring \(k\):

\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + \cdots + k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

since \(1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).

---

### Step 2: Find the ring in which 2026 lies

Find \(k\) such that

\[
1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026 > 1 + 3(k-1)k
\]

Simplify:

\[
3k(k+1) \geq 2025
\]
\[
k(k+1) \geq \frac{2025}{3} = 675
\]

Check some values:

- \(k=25\): \(25 \times 26 = 650 < 675\)
- \(k=26\): \(26 \times 27 = 702 \geq 675\)

So ring \(k=26\) contains 2026.

---

### Step 3: Find the start and position of number 2026 in ring 26

- Max number in ring 25 is 

\[
1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

- Ring 26 covers numbers:

\[
1952, 1953, \ldots, 1951 + 6 \times 26 = 1951 + 156 = 2107
\]

Number 2026 is in ring 26 at position:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75^{th}
\]

number in ring 26.

---

### Step 4: Hexagonal ring structure and positions

Each ring has 6 sides, each with \(k\) elements per side.

For ring \(k=26\), number of elements = \(6 \times 26 = 156\).

Positions 1 to 156 number the elements around the ring.

Positions 1 to 26: side 1

Positions 27 to 52: side 2

Positions 53 to 78: side 3

Positions 79 to 104: side 4

Positions 105 to 130: side 5

Positions 131 to 156: side 6

2026 is position 75 in ring 26, which is on side 3:

- side 3 starts at 53 ends at 78

Position on side 3:

\[
75 - 53 + 1 = 23
\]

---

### Step 5: Coordinates system for hex grid

We'll use an **axial coordinate system** for the hex grid, where 

- the center (number 1) is at \((0,0)\),
- rings increase by moving in the 6 directions.

The 6 directions (in axial coordinates \((q,r)\)):

1. East: \((+1, 0)\)
2. NorthEast: \((0, +1)\)
3. NorthWest: \((-1, +1)\)
4. West: \((-1, 0)\)
5. SouthWest: \((0, -1)\)
6. SouthEast: \((+1, -1)\)

---

### Step 6: Starting point on ring \(k\)

The smallest number on ring \(k\) is at coordinates:

\[
\text{start}_k = (k, 0)
\]

Number 2 (start of ring 1) is at \((1,0)\), number 8 (start of ring 2) at \((2,0)\), etc.

The points along the ring are traced by walking around the 6 edges, \(k\) steps each in the 6 directions in order:

1. Move in direction 4: west \((-1,0)\) \(k\) times
2. Move in direction 5: southwest \((0,-1)\) \(k\) times
3. Move in direction 6: southeast \((+1,-1)\) \(k\) times
4. Move in direction 1: east \((+1,0)\) \(k\) times
5. Move in direction 2: northeast \((0,+1)\) \(k\) times
6. Move in direction 3: northwest \((-1,+1)\) \(k\) times

(Or equivalently start at \((k,0)\) and move around the hexagon counterclockwise as above.)

---

### Step 7: Find coordinates of number 2026

Start position for ring 26:

\[
(26, 0)
\]

Positions 1 to 26: moving west \((-1,0)\)

Positions 27 to 52: moving southwest \((0,-1)\)

Positions 53 to 78: moving southeast \((+1,-1)\)

Positions 79 to 104: moving east \((+1,0)\)

Positions 105 to 130: moving northeast \((0,+1)\)

Positions 131 to 156: moving northwest \((-1,+1)\)

Position 75 lies in the third segment (53 to 78), so:

- offset in third edge segment:

\[
75 - 53 = 22 \quad (\text{0-based offset})
\]

Coordinates:

\[
(26,0) + \underbrace{26 \times (-1,0)}_{\text{edge 1}} + \underbrace{26 \times (0,-1)}_{\text{edge 2}} + (22 + 1) \times (1,-1)
\]

Wait, careful: The first 26 steps walk from start position:

- Start: \((26,0)\)

- After 26 steps west:

\[
(26, 0) + 26 \times (-1, 0) = (0, 0)
\]

- Then 26 steps southwest:

\[
(0, 0) + 26 \times (0, -1) = (0, -26)
\]

- Now, position 53 corresponds to \((0, -26) + 1 \times (1, -1) = (1, -27)\) (since the first position after southwest edge starts at 53, that is first step on the southeast edge).

Position 75 is 22 steps after 53 (0-based offset 22).

So full coordinate is:

\[
(0, -26) + (22 + 1) \times (1, -1) = (0, -26) + 23 \times (1, -1) = (23, -26 - 23) = (23, -49)
\]

---

### Step 8: Summary of position of 2026

\[
\boxed{
\text{number } 2026 \text{ coordinates} = (23, -49)
}
\]

---

### Step 9: Neighbors of a hex at \((q,r)\)

Neighbors in axial coordinates:

\[
( q+1, r ), ( q, r+1 ), ( q-1, r+1 ), ( q-1, r ), ( q, r-1 ), ( q+1, r-1 )
\]

---

### Step 10: Need a function to convert coordinates \((q,r)\) back to the number

To compute neighbors, convert coordinates \(\to\) number.

---

### Step 11: Radial distance (= ring number) of point \((q,r)\)

Distance from \((0,0)\) in hex axial:

\[
\text{ring } k = \max(|q|, |r|, | -q - r|)
\]

Calculate for \(2026\):

\[
q=23, r=-49, s = -q - r = -23 + 49 = 26
\]

\[
k = \max(23, 49, 26) = 49
\]

Wait, this contradicts our ring 26. This is because the ring is the maximal absolute coordinate among \(|q|, |r|, |s|\), check carefully.

Earlier, we found \(k=26\) for the ring. But now the coordinate \((23, -49)\) shows \(k=49\)

This suggests an error in direction vectors or the interpretation of start positions and directions.

---

### Step 12: Reconsider direction vectors and movements

Let me clarify axial directions:

From the usual standard axial coordinates:

Neighbors from \((q, r)\):

- \( (q+1, r) \) East
- \( (q+1, r-1) \) Southeast
- \( (q, r-1) \) Southwest
- \( (q-1, r) \) West
- \( (q-1, r+1) \) Northwest
- \( (q, r+1) \) Northeast

So the six neighbors are:

\[
E = (1, 0), SE = (1, -1), SW = (0, -1), W = (-1, 0), NW = (-1, 1), NE = (0, 1)
\]

---

### Step 13: Path around ring \(k\)

Starting point ring k is at \((q, r) = (k, 0)\).

Then walk in directions in order:

1. **NW:** \((-1, +1)\) multiplied by k steps  
2. **W:** \((-1, 0)\) k steps  
3. **SW:** \((0, -1)\) k steps  
4. **SE:** \((1, -1)\) k steps  
5. **E:** \((1, 0)\) k steps  
6. **NE:** \((0, 1)\) k steps

Meaning the ring is traced counterclockwise starting from \((k, 0)\) by moving:

- NW k steps
- W k steps
- SW k steps
- SE k steps
- E k steps
- NE k steps

---

### Step 14: Positions along ring 26

Ring has \(6 \times 26 = 156\) vertices.

Positions:

- 1 to 26: NW (-1,1)
- 27 to 52: W (-1,0)
- 53 to 78: SW (0,-1)
- 79 to 104: SE (1,-1)
- 105 to 130: E (1,0)
- 131 to 156: NE (0,1)

Position 75 lies in segment 53 to 78 (SW)

Position in segment:

\[
75 - 53 = 22 \quad\text{(0-based offset)}
\]

Coordinates:

\[
(26, 0) + 26 \times (-1,1) + 26 \times (-1,0) + 22 \times (0,-1) + (for offset, 0-based counting so add 1 or not?)

\]

Check carefully:

Actually, positions 53 to 78 correspond to the SW moves along the ring:

- At position 53 (start of SW edge):

\[
(26, 0) + 26 \times (-1,1) + 26 \times (-1,0) + 0 \times (0,-1)
\]

Calculate:

- \(26 \times (-1,1) = (-26, 26)\)
- \(26 \times (-1,0) = (-26, 0)\)

Sum:

\[
(26, 0) + (-26, 26) + (-26, 0) = (26 - 26 - 26, 0 + 26 + 0) = (-26, 26)
\]

Wait, reconsider this:

We seem to be double subtracting: “26 \times (-1,1)” then “26 \times (-1,0)”?

But the walk around ring is sequential:

- Start at \((26, 0)\),

- From positions 1 to 26: move NW \((-1,1)\), 0 to 25 steps

- Positions 27 to 52: W (-1,0), 0 to 25 steps

- Positions 53 to 78: SW (0,-1), 0 to 25 steps

So for position 75 within SW segment:

Number of steps in first two segments:

- NW steps: 26

- W steps: 26

The final position is:

\[
(26, 0) + 26 \times (-1, 1) + 26 \times (-1, 0) + (75 - 53) \times (0, -1)
\]

Calculate:

- \(26 \times (-1, 1) = (-26, 26)\)
- \(26 \times (-1, 0) = (-26, 0)\)
- \(75 - 53 = 22\), so \(22 \times (0, -1) = (0, -22)\)

Sum all:

\[
(26, 0) + (-26, 26) + (-26, 0) + (0, -22) = (26 - 26 - 26 + 0, 0 + 26 + 0 - 22) = (-26, 4)
\]

---

### Step 15: Coordinates of number 2026 are \(\boxed{(-26, 4)}\).

---

### Step 16: Confirm ring distance

Calculate ring number \(k\):

\[
k = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|) = \max(26, 4, |-(-26) - 4|) = \max(26, 4, |26 - 4|) = \max(26,4,22) = 26
\]

Correct!

---

### Step 17: Step to find neighbor coordinates

Neighbors are at:

\[
(-26 + 1, 4),\\
(-26 + 1, 4 - 1),\\
(-26, 4 - 1),\\
(-26 - 1, 4),\\
(-26 - 1, 4 + 1),\\
(-26, 4 + 1)
\]

Or explicitly:

1. \(E = (-25, 4)\)

2. \(SE = (-25, 3)\)

3. \(SW = (-26, 3)\)

4. \(W = (-27, 4)\)

5. \(NW = (-27, 5)\)

6. \(NE = (-26, 5)\)

---

### Step 18: Function to convert \((q, r)\) to number

To convert \((q,r)\) to the number:

1. Compute ring \(k = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q - r|)\)

2. Find the **minimum number** in ring \(k\):

\[
M_k = 1 + 3k(k-1)
\]

Because:

- Ring 0 max: 1
- Ring 1 max: \(1 + 3\cdot1\cdot(1+1) = 1 + 6 = 7\)
  
Wait, we need to check the general formula for max element number of ring \(k\):

Earlier, we wrote:

\[
1 + 3 k (k+1)
\]

which is the maximum number in ring \(k\)

The minimum number in ring \(k\) is:

\[
1 + 3 k (k-1) + 1 = 3k(k-1) + 2
\]

This is because:

- The last number in ring \(k-1\) is \(1 + 3(k-1)k\)
- So first number in ring \(k\) is last number in ring \(k-1\) + 1

---

Check this for example \(k=1\)

- Max number ring 0 = 1

- Max number ring 1 = \(1 + 3 \times 1 \times 2 = 7\)

- So min number ring 1 = \(1 + 3 \times 1 \times 0 + 1 = 2\)

Confirmed

---

### Step 19: To find the offset of \((q,r)\) in ring \(k\)

We want to know how far from the minimal ring number this point is.

---

### Step 20: Determine the side and position on side for \((q,r)\)

The ring edges are segmented into 6 sides, length \(k\).

Each side corresponds to moving along a particular direction from each corner.

The corners of ring \(k\) are:

\[
C_n = k \times d_n
\]

where \(d_n\) are the corner directions:

Using standard hex corner directions in axial:

- \(d_0 = (k, 0)\)

- \(d_1 = (0, k)\)

- \(d_2 = (-k, k)\)

- \(d_3 = (-k, 0)\)

- \(d_4 = (0, -k)\)

- \(d_5 = (k, -k)\)

The sides are the edges connecting these corners.

We want to find in which side \((q,r)\) falls on ring \(k\).

From this answer (reference: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#rings):

We note possible approach:

- Compute which side \((q,r)\) is on by comparing coordinates.


Distance along each side is found by projecting vector \(\overrightarrow{C_n C_{n+1}}\).

---

### Step 21: Manually find ring 26 corner coordinates:

Corners:

- \(C_0 = (26, 0)\)

- \(C_1 = (0, 26)\)

- \(C_2 = (-26, 26)\)

- \(C_3 = (-26, 0)\)

- \(C_4 = (0, -26)\)

- \(C_5 = (26, -26)\)

---

### Step 22: Determine the side

Our point is \((-26, 4)\).

Is it on a side between which corners?

Sides are:

- Side 0: \(C_0 \to C_1\): from (26,0) to (0,26)

- Side 1: \(C_1 \to C_2\): (0,26) to (-26,26)

- Side 2: \(C_2 \to C_3\): (-26,26) to (-26,0)

- Side 3: \(C_3 \to C_4\): (-26,0) to (0,-26)

- Side 4: \(C_4 \to C_5\): (0,-26) to (26,-26)

- Side 5: \(C_5 \to C_0\): (26,-26) to (26,0)

---

Given \((-26,4)\), note:

- Its q coordinate = -26 (fixed)

- r coordinate = 4, which lies between \(26\) and \(0\).

Side 2 connects corners:

\[
(-26, 26) \to (-26, 0)
\]

Our point has \(q = -26\) and \(r = 4\) which lies between 26 and 0.

Hence, \((-26,4)\) lies on side 2.

---

### Step 23: Offset on side 2

Side 2 vector:

\[
C_3 - C_2 = (-26,0) - (-26,26) = (0, -26)
\]

Length \(= k = 26\).

Offset along this side of a point \(P = (-26, r)\):

\[
\text{offset} = C_2.r - r = 26 - 4 = 22
\]

Offset numbering from 0 to 25.

---

### Step 24: Compute the number at coordinate \((q,r)\)

Overall offset from minimal number in ring:

\[
\text{side length} \times \text{side number} + \text{offset on side}
\]

Sides are numbered 0 to 5 starting at \(C_0 \to C_1\).

Side 2 is the 3rd side (0-based indexing):

\[
2 \times 26 + 22 = 52 + 22 = 74
\]

Positions along ring \(k\):

Positions start at 1:

- Position = offset +1 = 75

Recall in step 3:

\[
2026 \text{ is 75th number in ring } 26
\]

---

### Step 25: Min number in ring 26

Calculate:

\[
M_{26} = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1951
\]

Number at offset 74 (0-based) is:

\[
N = M_{26} + 74 = 1951 + 74 = 2025
\]

Wait, we got 2025 instead of 2026.

But our offset calculation assumes offset 74 corresponds to position 75 on ring (which is number 2026).

So we need to add 1 more to offset to get position.

Therefore:

\[
\text{Position} = 75 \implies \text{offset} = 74
\]

But since number at offset 74 is 1951 + 74 = 2025, and 2026 is offset 75.

So correction is offset = 75, position = 76?

Mismatch shows the side offset indexing is 0-based or 1-based?

Actually, the minimal number corresponds to offset 0.

So final number:

\[
N = M_k + \text{offset}
\]

offset = side length * side index + offset on side.

We have side index = 2, offset on side = 22

\[
\Rightarrow \text{offset} = 2 \times 26 + 22 = 74
\]

Then

\[
N = 1951 + 74 = 2025
\]

---

We found point \((-26,4)\) with number 2025, but originally we wanted 2026 at (-26,4).

---

### Step 26: Re-check step 17 coordinates of number 2026

Notice the slight indexing error with offsets.

---

### Step 27: Correct offset on the side

Recalculate offset and be consistent in domain of indexing.

---

### Step back to step 14 coordinates:

Recall:

- position 75 in ring 26 corresponds to number 2026.

- which lies on side 2 (SW segment in earlier step), but now in this model side 2 connects \(C_2 \to C_3\).

Using the corner approach, side 2 corresponds to \(C_2 \to C_3\), running from \((-26, 26)\) to \((-26, 0)\).

Position on ring: \(74^{th}\) offset corresponds to \((-26,4)\)

Thus, number 2025 at \((-26, 4)\).

Our point 2026 has coordinates of \((-26, 3)\)

or

Offset on side = 23 (0-based)

28. So coordinates of 2026 should be \((-26, 3)\).

---

### Step 28: Calculate coordinates of neighbors of 2026

Coordinates of 2026:

\[
(-26, 3)
\]

Neighbors:

\[
E = (-25, 3), \quad SE = (-25, 2), \quad SW = (-26, 2), \quad W = (-27, 3), \quad NW = (-27, 4), \quad NE = (-26, 4)
\]

---

### Step 29: Now convert each neighbor coordinate back to number

---

### Step 30: Write a short function description for coordinate \((q,r)\)

1. Find ring \(k = \max(|q|, |r|, |-q-r|)\)

2. Find minimal number at ring \(k\):

\[
M_k = 1 + 3k(k-1)
\]

3. Identify side \(s\) and offset \(o\) for point:

- Corners:

\[
C_0 = (k, 0), \quad C_1 = (0, k), \quad C_2 = (-k, k), \quad C_3 = (-k, 0), \quad C_4 = (0, -k), \quad C_5 = (k, -k)
\]

- Sides between corners \(C_s \to C_{s+1}\)

Sides:

| Side | From  | To    | Vector          |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 0     | \(C_0\) | \(C_1\)  | \((-1, +1)\)    |
| 1     | \(C_1\) | \(C_2\)  | \((-1, 0)\)     |
| 2     | \(C_2\) | \(C_3\)  | \((0, -1)\)     |
| 3     | \(C_3\) | \(C_4\)  | \((+1, -1)\)    |
| 4     | \(C_4\) | \(C_5\)  | \((+1, 0)\)     |
| 5     | \(C_5\) | \(C_0\)  | \((0, +1)\)     |

4. Determine which side the point lies on by checking which side vector matches.

5. Calculate offset on that side = distance from \(C_s\) to point along the side vector.

6. Total offset in ring = \(s \times k + \text{offset}\)

7. Number:

\[
N = M_k + s \times k + \text{offset}
\]

---

### Step 31: Find side and offset of the neighbors

Let's process each neighbor:

---

**Neighbor 1: \((-25, 3)\)**

- Compute \(k = \max(|-25|, |3|, |25 - 3|) = \max(25, 3, 22) = 25\)

- \(M_{25} = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 24 = 1 + 1800 = 1801\)

Now find which side on ring 25 the point lies.

Corners:

\[
C_0 = (25, 0), C_1 = (0, 25), C_2 = (-25, 25), C_3 = (-25, 0), C_4 = (0, -25), C_5 = (25, -25)
\]

Checking its position relative to corners.

- The point has \(q=-25\), r=3, which is between \(C_3=(-25, 0)\) and \(C_2=(-25, 25)\)

This is side 2 (between \(C_2 \to C_3\)).

Side 2 vector: \((0, -1)\)

Offset along side = \(C_2.r - r = 25 - 3 = 22\)

Number:

\[
N = 1801 + 2 \times 25 + 22 = 1801 + 50 + 22 = 1873
\]

---

**Neighbor 2: \((-25, 2)\)**

\(k = \max(25, 2, 23) = 25\)

Same ring 25:

Side 2 again (because \(q = -25\))

Offset \(= 25 - 2 = 23\)

Number:

\[
N = 1801 + 50 + 23 = 1874
\]

---

**Neighbor 3: \((-26, 2)\)**

\(k = \max(26, 2, |26 - 2|) = \max(26, 2, 24) = 26\)

Corners \(C_2=(-26, 26)\) to \(C_3=(-26,0)\): side 2 of ring 26

Offset:

\[
26 - 2 = 24
\]

Number:

\[
M_{26} = 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1951
\]

\[
N = 1951 + 2 \times 26 + 24 = 1951 + 52 + 24 = 2027
\]

---

**Neighbor 4: \((-27, 3)\)**

\(k = \max(27, 3, 24) = 27\)

\(M_{27} = 1 + 3 \times 27 \times 26 = 1 + 2106 = 2107\)

Where is \((-27,3)\) on ring 27?

Possibilities:

- \(q = -27\)

- Looking at corners:

\[
C_2 = (-27, 27), C_3 = (-27, 0)
\]

Side 2 again for ring 27 with vector \((0,-1)\)

Offset:

\[
27 - 3 = 24
\]

Number:

\[
N = 2107 + 2 \times 27 + 24 = 2107 + 54 + 24 = 2185
\]

---

**Neighbor 5: \((-27, 4)\)**

\(k = 27\)

Offset on side 2 = \(27 - 4 = 23\)

Number = \(2107 + 54 + 23 = 2184\)

---

**Neighbor 6: \((-26, 4)\)**

We already know \((-26, 4)\) corresponds to number 2025.

---

### Step 32: The neighbors are:

| Coordinates | Number |
|-------------|--------|
| (-25, 3)    | 1873   |
| (-25, 2)    | 1874   |
| (-26, 2)    | 2027   |
| (-27, 3)    | 2185   |
| (-27, 4)    | 2184   |
| (-26, 4)    | 2025   |

---

### Step 33: Sum the neighbors

\[
1873 + 1874 + 2027 + 2185 + 2184 + 2025
\]

Calculate step by step:

\[
1873 + 1874 = 3747
\]
\[
3747 + 2027 = 5774
\]
\[
5774 + 2185 = 7959
\]
\[
7959 + 2184 = 10143
\]
\[
10143 + 2025 = 12168
\]

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]
