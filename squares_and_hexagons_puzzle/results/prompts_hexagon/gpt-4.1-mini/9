Let's analyze the problem carefully.

---

### Problem Restatement:

- Natural numbers are laid out on a *spiral on a hexagonal grid*.
- The partial layout is given (with number 1 near the center):

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

- We want the sum of all 6 neighbors of number 2026.

---

### Step 1: Understand the hexagonal spiral numbering

The numbers are arranged on a hexagonal grid in a spiral starting at 1 at the center.

- The center cell has number 1.
- Then numbers increase spiral-wise outward.
- Each "ring" around the center forms a hexagonal "shell."

This pattern is well-known: The hexagonal spiral indexing.

---

### Step 2: Recall properties of hexagonal spiral numbers

The counting on a hexagonal grid by shells is as follows:

- Shell 0 (center): just number 1.
- Shell 1 (1 ring around center): 6 numbers (2 to 7)
- Shell 2: 12 numbers (8 to 19)
- Shell n: 6n numbers

Total numbers up to shell n inclusive:

\[
1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

So:

\[
\text{Max number in shell } n = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

Alternatively:

\[
\text{Max number in shell } n = 3n^2 + 3n + 1
\]

---

### Step 3: Find which shell 2026 belongs to

We want to find \( n \) such that:

\[
3n^2 + 3n + 1 \ge 2026 > 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 1
\]

---

Calculate roughly:

Try to solve \(3n^2 + 3n + 1 \approx 2026\):

\[
3n^2 + 3n + 1 = 2026 \implies 3n^2 + 3n = 2025 \implies n^2 + n = 675
\]

Solve quadratic:

\[
n^2 + n - 675 = 0
\]

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\[
\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97
\]

Positive root:

\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 51.97}{2} = \frac{50.97}{2} \approx 25.485
\]

So:

- Shell 25 max number:

\[
3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 1 = 3 \times 625 + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
\]

1951 < 2026

- Shell 26 max number:

\[
3(26)^2 + 3(26) + 1 = 3 \times 676 + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 79 = 2107 \quad \text{(double check)}

\]

Wait, previous calculation step suspicious:

Correct calculation:

\[
3(26)^2 = 3 \times 676 = 2028
\]
\[
3(26) = 78
\]

Sum: 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107 (correct)

So:

- Shell 25 max is 1951 < 2026 <= 2107 shell 26 max

Therefore, number 2026 lies in shell \( n=26 \).

---

### Step 4: Properties of shell \( n=26 \)

- Shell 26 has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers.
- The shell starts after 1951, so the first number in shell 26 is \( 1952 \).
- The last number in shell 26 is 2107.
- 2026 is the number in shell 26, and positioned \( 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75 \)th number in shell 26.

---

### Step 5: How to find neighbors?

In hexagonal spiral, every cell has 6 neighbors.

The neighbors of a cell in shell \( n \) are:

- Cells in shell \( n \) (adjacent on same ring)
- Cells in shell \( n-1 \) (inner ring)
- Cells in shell \( n+1 \) (outer ring)

The structure is known to have a cycle of hexagons around.

---

### Step 6: How are neighbors arranged?

Numbers in shell \( n \) are arranged in 6 segments ("edges") of length \( n \) each (because shell \( n \) has \(6n\) numbers).

Numbering around the shell goes along the edges:

- Shell \( n \) numbering: positions from 1 to \( 6n \)
- Position 1 is at the "corner" of the hexagon, then edges run 1 to \( n \).

We have 6 edges, each with \( n \) numbers.

---

### Step 7: Locate 2026 within shell 26

We have:

- Position in shell 26: 75

Let's find:

- Which edge (segment) does position 75 belong to?
- And its offset within that edge?

Positions per edge: 26 numbers.

Edges:

- Edge 1: positions 1 to 26
- Edge 2: 27 to 52
- Edge 3: 53 to 78
- Edge 4: 79 to 104
- and so on

75 lies in edge 3 (positions 53 to 78).

- Offset in edge = 75 - 52 = 23 (since 52 is max of edge 2)

So, 2026 is on 3rd edge, 23rd position in the edge.

---

### Step 8: Neighbors of a cell in the spiral: characterization

For an inner edge cell at shell \( n \) at edge \( e \) and offset \( k \):

Neighbors are:

1. Previous and next cell in shell \( n \)
   - Positions \( \pm 1 \) in shell \( n \), with wrap-around.
2. Corresponding cells in inner shell \( n-1 \)
3. Corresponding cells in outer shell \( n+1 \)

---

### Step 9: Write formulas for neighbors

Labeling:

- Current cell: shell \( n \), edge \( e \), offset \( k \), position in shell \( p \)
- Shell \( n \) size: \( 6n \)
- Shell \( n-1 \) size: \( 6(n-1) \)
- Shell \( n+1 \) size: \( 6(n+1) \)

Positions are numbered along shell from 1 to \(6n\).

Positions in shell \( n \):

\[
p = (e-1) \times n + k
\]

---

Neighbors:

1. **Shell \( n \) neighbors:**

- Previous: \(p_{prev} = p-1\), wrap-around to \(6n\) if \(p=1\)
- Next: \(p_{next} = p+1\), wrap-around to 1 if \(p=6n\)

2. **Shell \( n-1 \) neighbors:**

- The inner shell has \(6(n-1)\) elements, organized in edges similar to outer shell but shorter

Each cell in shell \( n \) has two neighbors inward:

- On edge \( e \) of shell \( n-1 \), position \( k \) (or \( k-1 \) if \( k=0 \)).

Since \( k \) runs 1 to \( n \):

- If \( k < n \), inner neighbors are on edge \( e \), offsets \( k \) and \( k-1 \).
- If \( k = n \), the position corresponds to edge \( (e \mod 6) +1 \) in inner shell, offset 1.

---

3. **Shell \( n+1 \) neighbors:**

- Outer shell \( n+1 \) has \( 6(n+1) \) elements.

- Position neighbors outward are on edges \( e \) and \( e+1 \), offsets \( k \) and \( k+1 \).

---

### Step 10: Apply to \( n=26, e=3, k=23 \)

- Shell 26 has 156 elements.

- \( p = (3-1) \times 26 + 23 = 2 \times 26 + 23 = 52 + 23 = 75 \) as above.

---

**Shell 26 neighbors:**

- \(p_{prev} = 74\)
- \(p_{next} = 76\)

---

**Shell 25 neighbors:**

Shell 25 has 150 elements.

- \( n-1 = 25 \), edges numbered 1 to 6, offset 1 to 25.

Check if \( k < n \):

- \( k=23 < 26 \) yes

Therefore inner neighbors:

- Edge \( e = 3 \), offset \( k = 23 \)
- Edge \( e = 3 \), offset \( k-1 = 22 \)

Positions in shell 25:

\[
p_{inner1} = (3-1)*25 + 23 = 2*25 + 23 = 50 + 23 = 73
\]
\[
p_{inner2} = (3-1)*25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72
\]

---

**Shell 27 neighbors:**

Shell 27 has \(6 \times 27 = 162\) elements.

Outer neighbors are on edge \( e = 3 \) and \( e+1 = 4 \).

Offsets \( k = 23 \), and \( k + 1=24 \).

Check:

- For edge 3, offset 23

\[
p_{outer1} = (3 - 1)*27 + 23 = 2*27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77
\]

- For edge 4, offset 24

\[
p_{outer2} = (4 - 1)*27 + 24 = 3*27 + 24 = 81 + 24 = 105
\]

---

### Step 11: Convert these positions to actual numbers

Recall:

- Shell \( n \) starts at:

\[
S_n = 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 2
\]

This is the first number of shell \( n \).

Equivalently, from max shell \( n-1 \):

\[
S_n = 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 2
\]

Check for shell 26:

Shell 25 max:

\[
M_{25} = 3 \times 25^2 + 3 \times 25 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
\]

Shell 26 starts at 1952.

Check shell 26 start via formula:

\[
S_{26} = 3(25)^2 + 3(25) + 2 = 3 \times 625 + 75 + 2 = 1875 + 75 + 2 = 1952
\]

Correct.

Number at position \( p \) in shell \( n \) is:

\[
N(n, p) = S_n + p - 1
\]

---

Numbers to find:

- Shell 26 neighbors:

  - \(p=74 \to N(26, 74) = 1952 + 74 - 1 = 2025\)

  - \(p=76 \to N(26, 76) = 1952 + 76 - 1 = 2027\)

- Shell 25 neighbors:

  - \(p=72 \to N(25, 72) = S_{25} + 72 -1\)

Calculate \( S_{25} \):

\[
S_{25} = 3 \times 24^2 + 3 \times 24 + 2 = 3 \times 576 + 72 + 2 = 1728 + 74 = 1802
\]

So

\[
N(25, 72) = 1802 + 71 = 1873
\]

\[
N(25, 73) = 1802 + 72 = 1874
\]

- Shell 27 neighbors:

Calculate \( S_{27} \):

\[
S_{27} = 3 \times 26^2 + 3 \times 26 + 2 = 3 \times 676 + 78 + 2 = 2028 + 80 = 2108
\]

Therefore,

\[
N(27, 77) = 2108 + 76 = 2184
\]

\[
N(27, 105) = 2108 + 104 = 2212
\]

---

### Step 12: List all neighbors

The neighbors of 2026 are:

- On shell 26: 2025, 2027
- On shell 25: 1873, 1874
- On shell 27: 2184, 2212

---

### Step 13: Sum them all

Calculate:

\[
S = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2212
\]

Sum groupwise:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(2184 + 2212 = 4396\)

Sum total:

\[
4052 + 3747 + 4396 = (4052 + 3747) + 4396 = 7799 + 4396 = 12195
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12195}
\]

---

### Summary:

- We identified the shell of 2026.
- Determined its relative position in the shell.
- Found neighbors in same, inner, and outer shells by formula.
- Translated positions to actual numbers.
- Summed all six neighbors.

---

If you want, I can provide a code to verify these calculations, but given the mathematical derivation, this should be the correct answer.
