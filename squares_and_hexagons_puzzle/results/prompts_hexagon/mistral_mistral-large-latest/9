Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged on this hexagonal grid. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the number 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward in layers or "rings" around it. Each ring seems to have a certain number of numbers, and the arrangement is hexagonal, meaning each number (except those on the edges of the grid) has six neighbors.

### Identifying the Ring Structure

Let's try to identify how many numbers are in each ring around the center (number 1):

- **Ring 0 (center):** Just the number 1. Count: 1
- **Ring 1:** Numbers 2 to 7. Count: 6
- **Ring 2:** Numbers 8 to 19. Count: 12
- **Ring 3:** Numbers 20 to 37. Count: 18
- And so on...

It appears that the number of numbers in the nth ring is 6n. For example:
- Ring 1: 6*1 = 6
- Ring 2: 6*2 = 12
- Ring 3: 6*3 = 18
- etc.

### Determining the Ring for 2026

Now, let's find out which ring the number 2026 is in. The total number of numbers up to the (k-1)th ring is the sum of the first (k-1) rings plus the center:

Total numbers up to (k-1)th ring = 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6*(k-1) = 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 1 + 6*(k-1)*k/2 = 1 + 3k(k-1)

We want to find the smallest k such that the total numbers up to kth ring is at least 2026.

Total up to kth ring = 1 + 3k(k+1)

We need to solve for k in:

1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026
3k(k+1) ≥ 2025
k(k+1) ≥ 675

Let's find k:

k^2 + k - 675 ≥ 0

Solving the quadratic equation k^2 + k - 675 = 0:

k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97, so:

k ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485

So, k ≈ 25.485, meaning k = 26 (since we need the integer where the inequality holds).

Let's check:

For k=25:
1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

For k=26:
1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

2026 is between 1951 and 2107, so it's in the 26th ring.

### Position of 2026 in the 26th Ring

The first number in the 26th ring is the number after the last number of the 25th ring.

Last number of 25th ring: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951
First number of 26th ring: 1952
Last number of 26th ring: 2107

So, 2026 is the 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in the 26th ring.

The 26th ring has 6*26 = 156 numbers.

### Neighbors in a Hexagonal Grid

In a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors: one in each of the six hexagonal directions. The exact positions depend on how the spiral is constructed, but generally, for a number in a ring, its neighbors are:

1. One neighbor is the next number in the same ring (either +1 or -1, depending on the direction of the spiral).
2. One neighbor is the previous number in the same ring.
3. Two neighbors are in the previous ring (one "inward" in the direction of the spiral, and one adjacent to that).
4. Two neighbors are in the next ring (one "outward" in the direction of the spiral, and one adjacent to that).

However, since 2026 is not at the start or end of the ring, it has all six neighbors as follows:

- One neighbor is 2025 (previous in the ring).
- One neighbor is 2027 (next in the ring).
- Two neighbors are in the 25th ring.
- Two neighbors are in the 27th ring.

### Finding the Neighbors in the Previous Ring (25th)

The 25th ring has 150 numbers (6*25). The numbers in the 25th ring are from 1952 to 2101 (but wait, earlier we had last number of 25th ring as 1951, so 25th ring is 1952 to 2101, which is 150 numbers).

The position of 2026 in the 26th ring is the 75th number. The 26th ring is divided into 6 sides of 26 numbers each (since 6*26=156). So, 75 / 26 ≈ 2.88, meaning it's on the 3rd side (since 26*2=52, 26*3=78, so 75 is the 23rd number on the 3rd side).

The neighbors in the previous ring correspond to numbers that are "inward" from the current number. Typically, for a number in the nth ring at position p, the inward neighbors are at positions p and p-1 in the (n-1)th ring.

But since the exact mapping is complex, let's think differently: the numbers in the nth ring are arranged such that each number is adjacent to two numbers in the (n-1)th ring. For a number at position p in the nth ring, the inward neighbors are at positions floor((p-1)/n) and ceil(p/n) in the (n-1)th ring.

For 2026 in the 26th ring at position 75:

floor((75-1)/26) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) = 2
ceil(75/26) = ceil(2.884) = 3

So, the inward neighbors are the 2nd and 3rd numbers in the 25th ring's corresponding side.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe a better approach is to note that the first number of the nth ring is 3n(n-1) + 2.

First number of 25th ring: 3*25*24 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802
Wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation where first number of 26th ring is 1952, so last of 25th is 1951, so first of 25th is 1952 - 150 = 1802.

So, 25th ring: 1802 to 1951
26th ring: 1952 to 2107

Position of 2026 in 26th ring: 2026 - 1951 = 75

Now, the inward neighbors are at positions 75 and 75 - 1 = 74 in the 25th ring's numbering, but since the 25th ring has 150 numbers, we can find the corresponding numbers.

The 26th ring is divided into 6 sides of 26 numbers. 75 is on the 3rd side (since 26*2=52, 26*3=78), so it's the 75 - 52 = 23rd number on the 3rd side.

The inward neighbors correspond to the 23rd and 22nd numbers on the 3rd side of the 25th ring.

The 25th ring has 6 sides of 25 numbers each. The 3rd side starts at 1802 + 2*25 = 1852, and goes to 1852 + 24 = 1876.

So, 22nd number on 3rd side: 1852 + 21 = 1873
23rd number on 3rd side: 1852 + 22 = 1874

So, inward neighbors are 1873 and 1874.

### Finding the Neighbors in the Next Ring (27th)

Similarly, the outward neighbors are in the 27th ring. The 27th ring starts at 2108 and has 162 numbers (6*27).

The outward neighbors correspond to the same position in the next ring's side. Since 2026 is the 23rd number on the 3rd side of the 26th ring, its outward neighbors are the 23rd and 24th numbers on the 3rd side of the 27th ring.

The 27th ring has 6 sides of 27 numbers each. The 3rd side starts at 2108 + 2*27 = 2162, and goes to 2162 + 26 = 2188.

So, 23rd number: 2162 + 22 = 2184
24th number: 2162 + 23 = 2185

So, outward neighbors are 2184 and 2185.

### Immediate Neighbors in the Same Ring

In the same ring, the neighbors are the previous and next numbers:

Previous: 2025
Next: 2027

### Verifying All Six Neighbors

So, the six neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (previous in ring)
2. 2027 (next in ring)
3. 1873 (inward, previous ring)
4. 1874 (inward, previous ring)
5. 2184 (outward, next ring)
6. 2185 (outward, next ring)

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these six numbers:

2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185

Let's calculate step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1873 + 1874 = 3747
2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now, sum these partial sums:

4052 + 3747 = 7799
7799 + 4369 = 12168

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **12168**.
