Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral of natural numbers arranged on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in this arrangement.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the numbers spiral outward from the center, which is 1. Here's how the numbers are placed:

1. Start with 1 at the center.
2. The next number, 2, is placed to the right of 1.
3. Then, the spiral moves counterclockwise: up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right, and then back to the right to continue the spiral.

This is similar to how numbers are arranged in a hexagonal grid where each number (except those on the edges of the spiral) has six neighbors.

### Identifying the Layers

In such spirals, numbers are often grouped into layers or rings around the center. The first layer is just the number 1. The second layer consists of numbers 2 through 7 (6 numbers), the third layer from 8 to 19 (12 numbers), and so on.

Generally, the nth layer (starting from n=0 at the center) has:
- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2 to 7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8 to 19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20 to 37)
- ...
- Layer k: 6k numbers

The total number of numbers up to layer k is 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 3k(k + 1).

### Finding the Layer of 2026

We need to find out which layer the number 2026 is in. To do this, we'll find the smallest k such that the total numbers up to layer k is at least 2026.

Let's solve for k in 1 + 3k(k + 1) ≥ 2026.

3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0
k² + k - 675 ≥ 0

Solving the quadratic equation k² + k - 675 = 0:

k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97, so k ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485

So, k ≈ 25.485, meaning the integer k is 25 (since at k=25, the total is less than 2026, and at k=26, it's more).

Calculate total at k=25:
1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

At k=26:
1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So, 2026 is in layer 26 (since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107).

### Position within the Layer

Now, let's find out where 2026 is within layer 26.

Numbers in layer 26: from 1952 to 2107 (2107 - 1951 = 156 numbers, which is 6*26, correct).

Position of 2026 within the layer: 2026 - 1951 = 75.

So, 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26.

### Structure of a Layer

Each layer k has 6k numbers, divided into 6 sides of k numbers each.

For layer 26, there are 6 sides, each with 26 numbers.

So, side 1: 1952 to 1977 (26 numbers)
side 2: 1978 to 2003
side 3: 2004 to 2029
side 4: 2030 to 2055
side 5: 2056 to 2081
side 6: 2082 to 2107

2026 is in side 3 (2004 to 2029), and its position within side 3 is 2026 - 2003 = 23 (since side 2 ends at 2003).

Wait, let's clarify:

Side 1: 1952 to 1952 + 25 = 1977 (26 numbers)
Side 2: 1978 to 1978 + 25 = 2003
Side 3: 2004 to 2004 + 25 = 2029
So, 2026 is in side 3, position 2026 - 2004 + 1 = 23 (1-based index in the side).

### Neighbors in the Hexagonal Grid

In a hexagonal grid, each number (except those on the edges) has six neighbors: two along the same side, and four connecting to adjacent sides.

For a number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), its neighbors are:
- Previous number in the same side
- Next number in the same side
- Two numbers from the previous side (one at the same position, one at position -1)
- Two numbers from the next side (one at the same position, one at position +1)

But since 2026 is at position 23 in side 3 (which has 26 numbers), it's not at a corner (corners are at positions 1 and 26).

So, its neighbors are:
1. Same side, previous: 2025
2. Same side, next: 2027
3. Previous side (side 2), same position: 2003 (position 23 in side 2: 1978 + 22 = 2000? Wait, let's calculate:

Side 2: 1978 to 2003 (26 numbers)
Position 23 in side 2: 1978 + 22 = 2000 (since 1978 is position 1)
Wait, no: position n is 1978 + (n - 1)
So position 23: 1978 + 22 = 2000

But earlier, side 2 is 1978 to 2003, so position 26 is 2003, position 23 is 2000.

Similarly, position 23 in side 4: 2030 + 22 = 2052

And position 22 in side 2: 1978 + 21 = 1999
position 24 in side 4: 2030 + 23 = 2053

So, neighbors:
1. Same side, previous: 2025
2. Same side, next: 2027
3. Previous side, same position: 2000
4. Previous side, position -1: 1999
5. Next side, same position: 2052
6. Next side, position +1: 2053

Wait, let's confirm the neighbor assignments in a hexagonal spiral.

In a hexagonal spiral, for a number not at a corner, the neighbors are:
- The number before and after in the same side.
- The number in the previous side at the same position and the one before that.
- The number in the next side at the same position and the one after that.

So for position p in side s:
- Same side: p-1, p+1
- Previous side (s-1): p, p-1
- Next side (s+1): p, p+1

But we have to be careful with the numbering. Let me think differently.

In the hexagonal grid, moving from one side to the next, the numbering increases by 1 at each step. The corners are where the direction changes.

For a number not at a corner, its neighbors are:
- The two adjacent numbers in the same side.
- The two numbers in the previous side that are adjacent to it (one is the same position, the other is position -1 in the previous side).
- The two numbers in the next side that are adjacent to it (one is the same position, the other is position +1 in the next side).

Given that, for 2026 at position 23 in side 3:
- Same side: 2025, 2027
- Previous side (side 2), position 23: 2000
- Previous side (side 2), position 22: 1999
- Next side (side 4), position 23: 2052
- Next side (side 4), position 24: 2053

So the six neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2000, 1999, 2052, 2053.

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let's verify the numbering to ensure these are correct.

Layer 26:
- Starts at 1952
- Side 1: 1952 to 1977 (26 numbers)
- Side 2: 1978 to 2003
- Side 3: 2004 to 2029
- Side 4: 2030 to 2055
- Side 5: 2056 to 2081
- Side 6: 2082 to 2107

2026 is in side 3, position 23 (2004 + 22 = 2026).

Neighbors:
1. Same side, previous: 2025
2. Same side, next: 2027
3. Previous side (side 2), position 23: 1978 + 22 = 2000
4. Previous side (side 2), position 22: 1978 + 21 = 1999
5. Next side (side 4), position 23: 2030 + 22 = 2052
6. Next side (side 4), position 24: 2030 + 23 = 2053

This seems correct.

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these six neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 1999 + 2052 + 2053

Let's add them step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
4052 + 2000 = 6052
6052 + 1999 = 8051
8051 + 2052 = 10103
10103 + 2053 = 12156

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **12156**.
