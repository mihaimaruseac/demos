Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in this hexagonal spiral. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can observe the following:

1. The number **1** is at the center.
2. The numbers spiral outward in layers or "rings" around the center.
3. Each ring seems to have a certain number of elements, and the numbers increase as we move outward.

### Identifying the Ring Structure

Let's try to identify how many numbers are in each ring:

- **Ring 0 (center):** Just the number 1. (1 number)
- **Ring 1:** Numbers 2 to 7. That's 6 numbers.
- **Ring 2:** Numbers 8 to 19. Let's count: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. That's 12 numbers.
- **Ring 3:** Numbers 20 to 37. Counting: 20 to 37 is 18 numbers.

From this, it seems that:

- Ring 0: 1 number
- Ring 1: 6 numbers
- Ring 2: 12 numbers
- Ring 3: 18 numbers
- ...
- Ring n: 6n numbers

So, the number of numbers in ring n is 6n.

### Finding the Ring for Number 2026

Now, let's find out which ring the number 2026 is in.

The total number of numbers up to ring n is:
1 (center) + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

We need to find the smallest n such that 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026.

Let's solve 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0
n² + n - 675 ≥ 0

Solving the quadratic equation n² + n - 675 = 0:
n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.97, so:
n ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485
n ≈ (-1 - 51.97)/2 ≈ -26.485 (ignore negative)

So, n ≈ 25.485. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n satisfying the inequality is 26.

Let's check n=25:
1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026

n=26:
1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 ≥ 2026

So, 2026 is in ring 26.

### Position of 2026 within Ring 26

Now, let's find out where 2026 is within ring 26.

Total numbers up to ring 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951
Numbers in ring 26: 6*26 = 156
So, numbers in ring 26: 1952 to 1951 + 156 = 2107

2026 is the 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in ring 26.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Grid and Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number (except the center) has six neighbors. The neighbors depend on the position within the ring.

Ring 26 has 156 numbers, which can be divided into 6 sides (since it's a hexagon), each side having 26 numbers (because 156 / 6 = 26).

So, the ring is divided into 6 segments of 26 numbers each.

Let's assign positions within the ring:

- First segment: positions 1 to 26
- Second segment: positions 27 to 52
- Third segment: positions 53 to 78
- Fourth segment: positions 79 to 104
- Fifth segment: positions 105 to 130
- Sixth segment: positions 131 to 156

2026 is the 75th number in the ring, which is in the third segment (positions 53 to 78).

Within its segment, it's the 75 - 52 = 23rd number (since first two segments have 52 numbers).

### Determining Neighbors

Now, let's determine the neighbors of 2026.

In a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors of a number depend on its position within the segment:

1. **First number in a segment (position 1 in segment):** neighbors are the last number of the previous segment, the next number in the same segment, and numbers from the previous ring.
2. **Last number in a segment (position 26 in segment):** neighbors are the previous number in the same segment, the first number of the next segment, and numbers from the previous ring.
3. **Middle numbers in a segment (positions 2 to 25):** neighbors are the previous and next numbers in the same segment, and numbers from the previous ring.

Since 2026 is the 23rd number in its segment (not first or last), its neighbors are:

- Previous number in the same segment: 2025
- Next number in the same segment: 2027
- Four numbers from the previous ring (ring 25)

Now, we need to find the four neighbors from ring 25.

### Finding Neighbors from Previous Ring

The numbers in ring 25 are from 1952 to 2107 - 156 = 1951 (but we know up to ring 25 is 1951, so ring 25 is 1952 to 2107 - 156 = 1951? Wait, no:

Wait, total up to ring 25 is 1951, so ring 26 starts at 1952 and goes to 2107.

Ring 25 is from 1951 - 6*25 = 1951 - 150 = 1801 to 1951.

Wait, no, let's re-express:

Total up to ring n: 1 + 3n(n+1)
So up to ring 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951
Ring 25: 1951 - 1801 + 1 = 151 numbers? Wait, no, ring n has 6n numbers, so ring 25 has 150 numbers, from 1951 - 150 + 1 = 1802 to 1951.

Similarly, ring 26: 156 numbers from 1952 to 2107.

Now, the neighbors from the previous ring (ring 25) for a number in ring 26 depend on its position in the segment.

For a number that's the k-th in its segment in ring n, its neighbors from ring n-1 are:

- The (k-1)-th number in the same segment in ring n-1
- The k-th number in the same segment in ring n-1
- The (k)-th number in the previous segment in ring n-1
- The (k-1)-th number in the next segment in ring n-1

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that in the hexagonal spiral, each number in ring n is adjacent to two numbers in the same ring (previous and next in the spiral) and four numbers in the previous ring (ring n-1), except for the first and last numbers in the ring which have slightly different adjacencies.

Given that 2026 is not the first or last in its ring (it's the 75th out of 156), it has:

- Previous in ring: 2025
- Next in ring: 2027
- Four from ring 25

The four from ring 25 can be determined by the position in the segment.

The segment length is 26, and 2026 is the 23rd in its segment.

The corresponding numbers in ring 25's segments would be:

- Same segment, position 22 (since 23 - 1)
- Same segment, position 23
- Previous segment, position 23
- Next segment, position 22

But let's think differently: in the hexagonal grid, moving from one ring to the next, each number in ring n is adjacent to two numbers in ring n-1 that are "before" and "after" it in the spiral, and two that are "across" in the previous ring.

A better approach is to realize that the neighbors from the previous ring are the numbers that are directly adjacent in the hexagonal grid, which can be found by considering the spiral's direction.

Given the complexity, perhaps a better way is to find the position in the spiral and then determine the neighbors based on that.

### Alternative Approach: Coordinates on Hexagonal Grid

Let's assign coordinates to the numbers to model the hexagonal grid. One way to do this is using axial or cube coordinates for hex grids.

In cube coordinates, each hex is represented by (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0.

The center (1) is at (0, 0, 0).

The spiral moves in a direction, say, right, then down-right, then down-left, then left, then up-left, then up-right, repeating.

But this might be too involved for this problem.

### Simplifying the Approach

Given the complexity, let's think differently: in the hexagonal spiral, each number (except the center) has six neighbors: two in the same ring (previous and next in the spiral), and four in the previous ring.

For 2026, which is not at the start or end of its ring, the neighbors are:

1. Previous in ring: 2025
2. Next in ring: 2027
3. Four from ring 25

The four from ring 25 can be found by noting that in the spiral, each number in ring n is adjacent to two numbers in ring n-1 that are "behind" it in the spiral, and two that are "ahead" in the previous ring.

Given that, the four neighbors from ring 25 are:

- The number in ring 25 that is at the same "angle" as 2026 (same position in the segment)
- The number in ring 25 that is one step behind in the spiral
- The number in ring 25 that is one step ahead in the spiral
- The number in ring 25 that is two steps ahead in the spiral

But calculating these requires knowing the exact position in the spiral.

Given that, perhaps a better way is to find the first number of ring 26 and then find the position of 2026 relative to it.

First number of ring 26: 1952
2026 is the 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75th number in ring 26.

Ring 26 has 156 numbers, divided into 6 segments of 26.

75 / 26 = 2 with remainder 23, so it's the 23rd number in the 3rd segment.

Now, the four neighbors from ring 25 are:

1. The 22nd number in the 3rd segment of ring 25
2. The 23rd number in the 3rd segment of ring 25
3. The 23rd number in the 2nd segment of ring 25
4. The 22nd number in the 4th segment of ring 25

Now, let's find these numbers.

First, find the first number of ring 25: up to ring 24 is 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801
Ring 25 has 6*25 = 150 numbers, so from 1802 to 1951.

Now, find the first number of each segment in ring 25:

- Segment 1: 1802 to 1802 + 25 - 1 = 1826
- Segment 2: 1827 to 1851
- Segment 3: 1852 to 1876
- Segment 4: 1877 to 1901
- Segment 5: 1902 to 1926
- Segment 6: 1927 to 1951

Now, the four neighbors from ring 25:

1. 22nd in 3rd segment: 1852 + 21 = 1873
2. 23rd in 3rd segment: 1852 + 22 = 1874
3. 23rd in 2nd segment: 1827 + 22 = 1849
4. 22nd in 4th segment: 1877 + 21 = 1898

So, the six neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 1873, 1874, 1849, 1898.

Now, sum them up:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1873 + 1874 = 3747
1849 + 1898 = 3747
Total: 4052 + 3747 + 3747 = 4052 + 7494 = 11546

But let's verify the neighbors from ring 25, as this seems a bit high.

### Verifying Neighbors from Ring 25

Is it correct that the four neighbors from ring 25 are:

- same segment, position -1: 22nd in 3rd segment
- same segment, same position: 23rd in 3rd segment
- previous segment, same position: 23rd in 2nd segment
- next segment, position -1: 22nd in 4th segment

This seems plausible based on hexagonal grid adjacency.

### Final Calculation

Sum of neighbors:

2025 (previous in ring)
+ 2027 (next in ring)
+ 1873 (22nd in 3rd segment of ring 25)
+ 1874 (23rd in 3rd segment of ring 25)
+ 1849 (23rd in 2nd segment of ring 25)
+ 1898 (22nd in 4th segment of ring 25)
= 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 1849 + 1898

Calculating step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
1873 + 1874 = 3747
1849 + 1898 = 3747
4052 + 3747 = 7799
7799 + 3747 = 11546

### Checking for Errors

Is there a simpler pattern to the neighbors? Maybe the sum can be expressed in terms of 2026.

In the hexagonal spiral, the sum of the six neighbors of a number n seems to be 6n + 6.

Let's test this with smaller numbers:

For n=1 (center), neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7: sum = 27
6*1 + 6 = 12 ≠ 27. Doesn't fit.

For n=2, neighbors are 1,3,7,8,9,10: sum = 38
6*2 + 6 = 18 ≠ 38.

Doesn't seem to fit.

Alternative approach: the sum seems to be 6n + 6*(ring number).

For n=2, ring 1: 6*2 + 6*1 = 18 ≠ 38.
No.

Perhaps the sum is 6n + 6*(ring number - 1).

For n=2, ring 1: 12 + 0 = 12 ≠ 38.
No.

Maybe the initial assumption about the neighbors is incorrect.

Alternative idea: the four neighbors from the previous ring might be n - 6k, n - 6k +1, n - 6(k-1), n - 6(k+1) +1, where k is the ring number.

For n=2026, ring 26:
k=26
n - 6*26 = 2026 - 156 = 1870
n - 6*26 +1 = 1871
n - 6*25 = 2026 - 150 = 1876
n - 6*27 +1 = 2026 - 162 +1 = 1865

But these don't match our earlier numbers (1873,1874,1849,1898). So this approach is incorrect.

Given that, our initial calculation seems the most plausible.

### Final Answer

After carefully determining the six neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and summing them up, the sum is:

**11546**
