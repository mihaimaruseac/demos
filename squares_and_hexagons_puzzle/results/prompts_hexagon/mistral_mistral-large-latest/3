Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in this arrangement.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in the hexagonal spiral. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the number 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward in layers or "rings" around it. Each complete ring around the center increases the distance from the center by one step in the hexagonal grid.

Let's try to visualize or sketch the first few layers:

- **Layer 0 (Center):** Just the number 1.
- **Layer 1:** Numbers 2 through 7, forming a hexagon around 1.
- **Layer 2:** Numbers 8 through 19, forming the next larger hexagon.
- And so on...

Each layer `n` starts with the number that comes after the last number of the previous layer and contains `6n` numbers (since each side of the hexagon in layer `n` has `n` numbers, and there are 6 sides).

### Determining the Layer of a Number

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine which layer it's in. The number of numbers up to layer `n` is given by the sum of the first `n` layers plus the center:

Total numbers up to layer `n` = 1 (center) + sum from k=1 to n of 6k = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

We need to find the smallest `n` such that 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026.

Let's solve for `n`:

3n(n+1) ≥ 2025
n(n+1) ≥ 675

Let's find `n` such that n² ≈ 675:
√675 ≈ 25.98, so try n=25:
25*26 = 650 < 675
n=26:
26*27 = 702 ≥ 675

So, 2026 is in layer 26.

### Position Within the Layer

Now, let's find out where 2026 is within layer 26.

The first number in layer 26 is the number right after the last number of layer 25.

Total numbers up to layer 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

So, layer 26 starts at 1952 and has 6*26 = 156 numbers, ending at 1951 + 156 = 2107.

2026 is the 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in layer 26.

### Structure of a Layer in Hexagonal Spiral

In a hexagonal spiral, each layer `n` can be thought of as having 6 sides, each of length `n`. The numbers are arranged such that:

- The first `n` numbers form the first side.
- The next `n` numbers form the second side, and so on, up to the sixth side.

However, the corners are shared between two sides, so the first number of each side is actually the last number of the previous side plus one.

Given that, let's see how the 75th number is placed in layer 26 (where each side has 26 numbers):

Number of complete sides before the 75th number:
75 / 26 ≈ 2.88, so it's in the 3rd side (since 2 sides would be 52 numbers, and 3 sides would be 78 numbers).

Wait, let's calculate:

After 2 sides: 2 * 26 = 52 numbers (positions 1 to 52)
After 3 sides: 3 * 26 = 78 numbers (positions 1 to 78)

75 is between 53 and 78, so it's in the 3rd side, at position 75 - 52 = 23 in that side.

So, 2026 is the 23rd number in the 3rd side of layer 26.

### Identifying Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number has up to 6 neighbors: one in each of the six hexagonal directions. The exact neighbors depend on the position within the side.

For a number in layer `n`, side `s`, position `p`:

- The neighbor in the direction of the previous side is the number at layer `n`, side `s-1`, position `p` (if `s > 1`), or layer `n-1` if `s=1`.
- The neighbor in the direction of the next side is the number at layer `n`, side `s+1`, position `p-1` (if `p > 1`), or the first number of side `s+1` if `p=1`.
- The neighbor in the outward direction is the number at layer `n+1`, side `s`, position `p`.
- The neighbor in the inward direction is the number at layer `n-1`, side `s`, position `p` (if `n > 1`), or the center if `n=1`.
- The other two neighbors are the numbers adjacent in the same side or the previous/next sides based on position.

Given that 2026 is at layer 26, side 3, position 23:

1. **Previous side neighbor (side 2, position 23):** This is the number at layer 26, side 2, position 23.
   - First number of side 2: first number of layer 26 + 26 (side 1) = 1952 + 26 = 1978
   - Position 23 in side 2: 1978 + 22 = 2000

2. **Next side neighbor (side 4, position 22):** This is the number at layer 26, side 4, position 22.
   - First number of side 4: first number of side 3 + 26 = (1978 + 26) + 26 = 2004 + 26 = 2030
   - Position 22 in side 4: 2030 + 21 = 2051
   - Wait, but 2026 is position 23 in side 3, so next side neighbor is position 22 in side 4: 2030 + 21 = 2051

   Hmm, seems like I might have an off-by-one error here. Let me re-examine:

   First number of side 1: 1952
   First number of side 2: 1952 + 26 = 1978
   First number of side 3: 1978 + 26 = 2004
   First number of side 4: 2004 + 26 = 2030
   First number of side 5: 2030 + 26 = 2056
   First number of side 6: 2056 + 26 = 2082

   So, position 23 in side 3: 2004 + 22 = 2026
   Next side neighbor is position 22 in side 4: 2030 + 21 = 2051

3. **Outward neighbor (layer 27, side 3, position 23):**
   - First number of layer 27: last number of layer 26 + 1 = 2107 + 1 = 2108
   - First number of side 1 in layer 27: 2108
   - First number of side 2: 2108 + 27 = 2135
   - First number of side 3: 2135 + 27 = 2162
   - Position 23 in side 3: 2162 + 22 = 2184

4. **Inward neighbor (layer 25, side 3, position 23):**
   - First number of layer 25: 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801
   - First number of side 1: 1801
   - First number of side 2: 1801 + 25 = 1826
   - First number of side 3: 1826 + 25 = 1851
   - Position 23 in side 3: 1851 + 22 = 1873

5. **Same side previous neighbor (position 22 in side 3):**
   - Position 22 in side 3: 2004 + 21 = 2025

6. **Same side next neighbor (position 24 in side 3):**
   - Position 24 in side 3: 2004 + 23 = 2027

Wait a minute, in a hexagonal grid, a number typically has neighbors in six directions, but in this spiral arrangement, the neighbors are:

- One in the previous side (same layer)
- One in the next side (same layer)
- One outward (next layer)
- One inward (previous layer)
- One in the same side before
- One in the same side after

But in the hexagonal grid, the "same side before" and "same side after" are actually the same as the "previous side next" and "next side previous" in some interpretations. Maybe it's better to think that each number has:

- Two neighbors in the same layer: one in the previous side, one in the next side
- Two neighbors in the next layer: one in the same side, one in the next side
- Two neighbors in the previous layer: one in the same side, one in the previous side

But given the spiral, the immediate neighbors are likely:

1. Previous number in the same side: 2025
2. Next number in the same side: 2027
3. Number in the previous side at same position: 2000
4. Number in the next side at previous position: 2051
5. Number in the next layer at same side and position: 2184
6. Number in the previous layer at same side and position: 1873

But let's verify if all these are indeed neighbors. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, which would correspond to:

- One in the direction of the previous side
- One in the direction of the next side
- One outward
- One inward
- One in the same direction as the side (same side next)
- One opposite to the same direction (same side previous)

Given that, the six neighbors of 2026 are likely:

1. Same side previous: 2025
2. Same side next: 2027
3. Previous side same position: 2000
4. Next side previous position: 2051
5. Outward same side same position: 2184
6. Inward same side same position: 1873

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let's list them:

1. 2025 (same side, previous)
2. 2027 (same side, next)
3. 2000 (previous side, same position)
4. 2051 (next side, previous position)
5. 2184 (next layer, same side and position)
6. 1873 (previous layer, same side and position)

Now, let's check if these make sense in terms of adjacency in the hexagonal grid.

In a hexagonal grid, moving from one number to its neighbor can be in six directions. The spiral arrangement suggests that:

- Moving to the same side next is one direction.
- Moving to the same side previous is the opposite direction.
- Moving to the previous side same position is another direction.
- Moving to the next side previous position is another direction.
- Moving outward is another direction.
- Moving inward is the last direction.

This seems consistent.

### Calculating the Sum

Now, let's sum these six neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 2000 + 2051 + 2184 + 1873

Let's add them step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
4052 + 2000 = 6052
6052 + 2051 = 8103
8103 + 2184 = 10287
10287 + 1873 = 12160

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **12160**.
