Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in this hexagonal spiral. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can observe the following:

1. The number **1** is at the center.
2. The numbers spiral outward in layers (or rings) around the center.
3. Each layer forms a hexagon around the previous layer.

Let's try to visualize or sketch the layers:

- **Layer 0 (Center):** Just the number 1.
- **Layer 1:** Numbers 2 to 7 forming a hexagon around 1.
  - From the example, it seems 2 is to the right of 1, then moving counterclockwise: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- **Layer 2:** Numbers 8 to 19 forming the next hexagon.
  - From the example, 8 is to the right of 2, then continuing the spiral outward.

However, the exact numbering isn't entirely clear from the small snippet, so let's try to deduce the pattern more carefully.

### Determining the Numbering Pattern

Looking at the given numbers:

- 1 is at the center.
- Around 1, we have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in some order.
- Then the next layer has numbers up to 19 (since 8 to 19 is 12 numbers, which would form a hexagon with 6 sides, each side having 2 numbers: 6 sides * 2 numbers = 12 numbers).

Similarly, the next layer would have numbers from 20 to 37 (18 numbers: 6 sides * 3 numbers), and so on.

This suggests that the number of numbers in each layer follows the pattern:

- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Layer 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- ...
- Layer n: 6n numbers

The total number of numbers up to layer n is:
1 (layer 0) + 6 (1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 * n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

We can find out which layer the number 2026 is in by solving for n in:
1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026

Let's solve 3n(n+1) ≥ 2025
n(n+1) ≥ 675

Approximate n:
n² ≈ 675
n ≈ √675 ≈ 25.98

So, n = 26:
3*26*27 = 3*702 = 2106
1 + 2106 = 2107 ≥ 2026

n = 25:
3*25*26 = 3*650 = 1950
1 + 1950 = 1951 < 2026

So, 2026 is in layer 26.

### Finding the Position of 2026 in Layer 26

Layer 26 has 6*26 = 156 numbers, from 1 + 3*25*26 + 1 = 1952 to 1951 + 156 = 2107.

2026 is the 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in this layer.

Now, the layer is divided into 6 sides, each with 26 numbers. So, 75 / 26 ≈ 2.88, meaning it's on the 3rd side (since we start counting sides from 0 or 1).

Let's calculate:

- Side 1: numbers 1 to 26
- Side 2: numbers 27 to 52
- Side 3: numbers 53 to 78

So, 75 is on side 3, and it's the 75 - 52 = 23rd number on that side.

### Identifying Neighbors in a Hexagonal Grid

In a hexagonal grid, each number (except those on the edges) has six neighbors: one in each of the six possible directions.

For a number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), its neighbors are:
- One from the previous layer (inward)
- One from the next layer (outward)
- Two from the same layer (left and right along the side)
- Two from adjacent sides (one from each adjacent side)

However, since 2026 is not at a corner (it's the 23rd number on a side with 26 numbers), it's not at the start or end of the side, so it has all six neighbors.

Now, let's determine which numbers are its neighbors.

#### Neighbors from the Same Layer (Left and Right)

On the same side:
- Left neighbor: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- Right neighbor: 2026 + 1 = 2027

#### Neighbors from Adjacent Sides

The sides are connected in a cycle. The previous side (side 2) and the next side (side 4) will contribute neighbors.

At the corners, the numbering wraps around. The first number of side 3 is connected to the last number of side 2, and the last number of side 3 is connected to the first number of side 4.

Since 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3, its neighbors from adjacent sides are:
- From side 2: the 23rd number on side 2 (since the sides are aligned)
  - Side 2 has numbers 27 to 52, so 23rd is 27 + 22 = 49
- From side 4: the 23rd number on side 4
  - Side 4 has numbers 79 to 104, so 23rd is 79 + 22 = 101

Wait, let's clarify the numbering within layers.

Actually, the numbering within a layer starts at the first side's first number and increments sequentially around the hexagon. So, the first number of side 1 is the first number of the layer, the first number of side 2 is the (26 + 1)th number, etc.

Given that, the 75th number is on side 3, and it's the 23rd number on that side (since side 1: 1-26, side 2: 27-52, side 3: 53-78).

The neighbor from the previous side (side 2) is the 23rd number on side 2, which is 27 + 22 = 49.
The neighbor from the next side (side 4) is the 23rd number on side 4, which is 79 + 22 = 101.

#### Neighbors from Inner and Outer Layers

Now, the inward neighbor (from layer 25) and outward neighbor (from layer 27).

The inward neighbor is the number in layer 25 that is directly inside 2026. The position in the layer corresponds to the same position in the previous layer's side.

Layer 25 has 6*25 = 150 numbers, from 1 + 3*24*25 + 1 = 1802 to 1801 + 150 = 1951.

The 75th number in layer 26 corresponds to the 75th number in layer 25, but since layer 25 has 150 numbers, and 75 is within that, the inward neighbor is the 75th number in layer 25.

Similarly, the outward neighbor is the 75th number in layer 27.

Calculating:

Layer 25 starts at 1802, so 75th number is 1802 + 74 = 1876.
Layer 27 starts at 1 + 3*26*27 + 1 = 1 + 2106 + 1 = 2108, so 75th number is 2108 + 74 = 2182.

Wait, let's verify the starting numbers:

Total numbers up to layer n: 1 + 3n(n+1)

Layer 25: up to 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Layer 26: 1952 to 2107
Layer 27: 2108 to 1 + 3*27*28 = 1 + 2268 = 2269

So, layer 25: 1802 to 1951 (150 numbers)
layer 26: 1952 to 2107 (156 numbers)
layer 27: 2108 to 2269 (162 numbers)

Thus, the 75th number in layer 25 is 1802 + 74 = 1876.
The 75th number in layer 27 is 2108 + 74 = 2182.

### Verifying the Neighbors

So, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
1. Left (same layer): 2025
2. Right (same layer): 2027
3. Previous side (side 2): 49
4. Next side (side 4): 101
5. Inward (layer 25): 1876
6. Outward (layer 27): 2182

Wait a minute, the numbers from adjacent sides seem too small compared to 2026. Maybe the way we're assigning neighbors from adjacent sides is incorrect.

Let me reconsider how the sides connect. Maybe the neighbor from the previous side is not the same position in the previous side, but rather the corresponding position considering the spiral's direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering within the layer is such that the sides are connected differently. Maybe the first number of side 3 is connected to the last number of side 2, and the last number of side 3 is connected to the first number of side 4.

Given that, the neighbor from side 2 would be the 23rd number from the end of side 2, which is the (52 - 23 + 1) = 30th number on side 2, which is 27 + 29 = 56.

Similarly, the neighbor from side 4 would be the 23rd number from the start of side 4, which is 79 + 22 = 101.

This seems inconsistent. Maybe a better approach is to find a general formula for the neighbors based on the position in the layer.

### Alternative Approach: Coordinates on Hexagonal Grid

Another way is to assign coordinates to each number in the hexagonal grid and then determine the neighbors based on those coordinates.

In a hexagonal grid, we can use axial or cube coordinates. Let's use cube coordinates (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0.

The center (1) is at (0, 0, 0).

The six directions are:
(1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1), (0, -1, 1), (1, -1, 0)

The spiral can be constructed by moving in these directions in a certain pattern.

However, without a clear pattern from the given example, this might be complex.

### Revisiting the Initial Approach

Given the complexity, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the neighbors are indeed 2025, 2027, 49, 101, 1876, 2182.

But 49 and 101 seem too small compared to 2026. Maybe the neighbors from adjacent sides are not the same position but offset.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering within the layer is such that the sides are connected in a way that the neighbor from the previous side is the same position in the previous side, but the previous side's numbers are much smaller, which doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the correct neighbors from adjacent sides are the numbers that are adjacent in the spiral's path, which would be the next and previous numbers in the sequence, but that would just be 2025 and 2027, which we already have.

This suggests that the initial approach might be missing something.

### Correcting the Neighbor Identification

Upon reflection, in a hexagonal spiral, the neighbors from adjacent sides are likely the numbers that are adjacent in the spiral's path when moving from one side to the next.

Given that, the neighbor from the previous side is the number that comes just before the first number of the current side, and the neighbor from the next side is the number that comes just after the last number of the current side.

For side 3 (53 to 78):
- First number is 53, which is after 52 (last of side 2), so neighbor from side 2 is 52.
- Last number is 78, which is before 79 (first of side 4), so neighbor from side 4 is 79.

Similarly, for the 23rd number on side 3 (2026), its neighbors from adjacent sides would be:
- From side 2: the 23rd number from the end of side 2, which is 52 - 23 + 1 = 30th number on side 2 = 27 + 29 = 56.
- From side 4: the 23rd number from the start of side 4 = 79 + 22 = 101.

This seems more plausible.

Similarly, the inward neighbor is the corresponding number in the previous layer, which is the 75th number in layer 25: 1802 + 74 = 1876.
The outward neighbor is the 75th number in layer 27: 2108 + 74 = 2182.

### Final Neighbor List

Thus, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
1. Left (same layer): 2025
2. Right (same layer): 2027
3. Previous side (side 2): 56
4. Next side (side 4): 101
5. Inward (layer 25): 1876
6. Outward (layer 27): 2182

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these neighbors:
2025 + 2027 + 56 + 101 + 1876 + 2182

Let's calculate step by step:
2025 + 2027 = 4052
4052 + 56 = 4108
4108 + 101 = 4209
4209 + 1876 = 6085
6085 + 2182 = 8267

### Verifying the Calculation

Let me verify the addition:
2025 + 2027 = 4052
4052 + 56 = 4108
4108 + 101 = 4209
4209 + 1876:
  4209 + 1800 = 6009
  6009 + 76 = 6085
6085 + 2182:
  6085 + 2000 = 8085
  8085 + 182 = 8267

The sum checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **8267**.
