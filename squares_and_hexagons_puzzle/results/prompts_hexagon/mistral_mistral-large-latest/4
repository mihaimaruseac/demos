Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Grid and Spiral

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged on the hexagonal grid. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the number 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward in layers or "rings" around it. Each ring seems to have a certain number of numbers, and the arrangement is hexagonal, meaning each number (except those on the edges of the spiral) has six neighbors.

### Identifying the Ring Structure

Let's try to identify how many numbers are in each ring around the center:

- **Ring 0 (center):** Just the number 1. (1 number)
- **Ring 1:** Numbers 2 through 7. That's 6 numbers.
- **Ring 2:** Numbers 8 through 19. Let's count: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. That's 12 numbers.
- **Ring 3:** Numbers 20 through 37. Counting: 20 to 37 is 18 numbers.

From this, it seems that:
- Ring 0: 1 number
- Ring 1: 6 numbers
- Ring 2: 12 numbers
- Ring 3: 18 numbers
- ...
- Ring n: 6n numbers

So, the number of numbers in ring n is 6n.

### Finding the Ring for a Given Number

Now, we need to find out which ring the number 2026 is in. The total number of numbers up to ring k is:

Total = 1 (center) + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 6k = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

We need to find the smallest k such that 1 + 3k(k+1) ≥ 2026.

Let's solve 3k(k+1) ≥ 2025 => k(k+1) ≥ 675.

Find k where k² ≈ 675 => k ≈ √675 ≈ 25.98.

So, try k=25: 25*26=650 < 675
k=26: 26*27=702 > 675

So, k=26 is the smallest integer where k(k+1) ≥ 675.

Check total numbers up to ring 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
Up to ring 26: 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

So, 2026 is in ring 26 because 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107.

### Position of 2026 within Ring 26

Now, let's find out where 2026 is located within ring 26.

Numbers in ring 26: from 1952 to 2107 (2107 - 1951 = 156 numbers, which is 6*26=156, correct).

Position within ring: 2026 - 1951 = 75th number in the ring.

Since the ring has 6 sides, each side has 26 numbers (because 6*26=156).

So, 75 / 26 ≈ 2.88, meaning it's on the 3rd side (since we count sides starting from 0 or 1, let's clarify).

Actually, let's think differently: the first side has numbers 1952 to 1952 + 25 = 1977 (26 numbers)
Second side: 1978 to 2003
Third side: 2004 to 2029
...

75th number:
1952 to 1977: 26 numbers (1-26)
1978 to 2003: 26 numbers (27-52)
2004 to 2029: 26 numbers (53-78)
So, 75th number is 75 - 52 = 23rd number on the third side: 2004 + 22 = 2026.

So, 2026 is the 23rd number on the third side of ring 26.

### Determining Neighbors on a Hexagonal Grid

On a hexagonal grid, each number (except those on the edges) has six neighbors: one in the previous ring, one in the next ring, and four in the same ring (two on the same side, one on the previous side, and one on the next side).

However, since 2026 is not at the start or end of its side (it's the 23rd out of 26), it's not a corner, so all six neighbors exist.

The neighbors are:
1. Previous number in the same ring: 2025
2. Next number in the same ring: 2027
3. Number in the previous ring directly "inward": this is the number in ring 25 that is in the same position relative to its side.
4. Number in the next ring directly "outward": similarly, the corresponding number in ring 27.
5. Number in the same ring, previous side, last number: since it's the 23rd on its side, the previous side's last number is the 26th on the second side: 2003.
6. Number in the same ring, next side, first number: the first number on the fourth side is 2030.

Wait, let's think more carefully about the hexagonal neighbors.

In a hexagonal spiral, for a number not at a corner, the six neighbors are:
- One in the previous ring (inward)
- One in the next ring (outward)
- One before it in the same ring (previous number)
- One after it in the same ring (next number)
- One from the previous side in the same ring
- One from the next side in the same ring

Given that, for 2026:
- Previous number: 2025
- Next number: 2027
- Inward: the number in ring 25 that is in the same position. Ring 25 has 6*25=150 numbers, starting at 1 + 3*24*25 + 1 = 1 + 1800 + 1 = 1802, ending at 1 + 3*25*26 = 2107 - 156 = 1951. Wait, no, earlier we had up to ring 25 is 1951, so ring 26 starts at 1952.

Wait, let's re-express:

Total up to ring n: 1 + 3n(n+1)
So up to ring 25: 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951
Ring 26: 1952 to 2107
Ring 25: 1 + 3*24*25 + 1 = 1 + 1800 + 1 = 1802 to 1951

Position within ring 26: 2026 - 1951 = 75
Position within ring 25: since ring 25 has 150 numbers, and the sides are proportional, the corresponding position is (75 / 156) * 150 ≈ 72.115, but since positions are integers, it's likely the same offset within the side.

Ring 25 has 6 sides of 25 numbers each (total 150).
75th in ring 26 is 23rd on the 3rd side (as earlier).
Similarly, in ring 25, the corresponding position is 23rd on the 3rd side.
First number on 3rd side of ring 25: 1802 (start) + 2*25 (first two sides) + 1 = 1802 + 50 + 1 = 1853
23rd number: 1853 + 22 = 1875

So, inward neighbor is 1875.

Similarly, outward neighbor is in ring 27.
Ring 27: starts at 2108, has 6*27=162 numbers.
Corresponding position: (75 / 156) * 162 ≈ 77.88, so likely 78th number in ring 27.
Ring 27 has 6 sides of 27 numbers each.
78 / 27 ≈ 2.88, so 3rd side, 78 - 2*27 = 24th number on 3rd side.
First number on 3rd side: 2108 + 2*27 + 1 = 2108 + 54 + 1 = 2163
24th number: 2163 + 23 = 2186

So, outward neighbor is 2186.

Previous side in same ring: 2026 is on 3rd side, 23rd number.
Previous side is 2nd side, last number is 2003 (as earlier).
Next side is 4th side, first number is 2030.

So, neighbors are:
1. Previous number: 2025
2. Next number: 2027
3. Inward: 1875
4. Outward: 2186
5. Previous side: 2003
6. Next side: 2030

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let's verify the inward and outward neighbors to ensure our method is correct.

For inward neighbor (ring 25):
- Ring 25: 1802 to 1951 (150 numbers)
- 75th in ring 26 corresponds to (75/156)*150 ≈ 72.115, so 72nd or 73rd.
But since sides are proportional, and ring 26 has sides of 26, ring 25 has sides of 25, the ratio is 25/26.
So, position in ring 25 is floor(75 * (25/26)) = floor(72.115) = 72.
72nd number in ring 25:
Ring 25 has 6 sides of 25 numbers.
72 / 25 = 2.88, so 3rd side, 72 - 2*25 = 22nd number on 3rd side.
First number on 3rd side: 1802 + 2*25 + 1 = 1853
22nd number: 1853 + 21 = 1874
Wait, earlier I had 1875, but it should be 1874.

Similarly, outward neighbor (ring 27):
Ring 27: 2108 to 2107 + 162 = 2269
Position: (75/156)*162 ≈ 77.88, so 78th.
78 / 27 ≈ 2.88, so 3rd side, 78 - 2*27 = 24th number.
First number on 3rd side: 2108 + 2*27 + 1 = 2163
24th number: 2163 + 23 = 2186 (matches earlier)

So, inward neighbor is 1874, not 1875. Earlier off by one.

Similarly, previous side in same ring:
2026 is 23rd on 3rd side.
Previous side is 2nd side, last number is 2003 (as 2nd side is 1978 to 2003, 26 numbers).
Next side is 4th side, first number is 2030 (as 4th side starts at 2030).

So, corrected neighbors:
1. Previous number: 2025
2. Next number: 2027
3. Inward: 1874
4. Outward: 2186
5. Previous side: 2003
6. Next side: 2030

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these six neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 2186 + 2003 + 2030

Let's add them step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052
4052 + 1874 = 5926
5926 + 2186 = 8112
8112 + 2003 = 10115
10115 + 2030 = 12145

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,145**.
