Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid, and we need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral Structure

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged on this hexagonal grid. From the given example:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

We can see that the number `1` is at the center. The numbers then spiral outwards in layers or rings around this center. Here's how the layers seem to be structured:

- **Layer 0 (Center):** Just the number `1`.
- **Layer 1:** Numbers `2` to `7` forming a hexagon around `1`.
- **Layer 2:** Numbers `8` to `19` forming the next hexagon.
- And so on...

Each layer `n` (starting from 0) seems to have a certain number of elements. Let's determine how many numbers are in each layer.

### Determining the Number of Elements in Each Layer

Looking at the given example:

- Layer 0: 1 number (`1`).
- Layer 1: 6 numbers (`2` to `7`).
- Layer 2: 12 numbers (`8` to `19`).

It appears that layer `n` has `6n` numbers. Let's verify:

- Layer 0: 6*0 = 0, but it has 1 number. Maybe layer `n` has `6n` numbers for `n >= 1`, and layer 0 is a special case with 1 number.
- Layer 1: 6*1 = 6 numbers (`2` to `7`).
- Layer 2: 6*2 = 12 numbers (`8` to `19`).

This seems correct. So, the total number of numbers up to layer `n` is:

- Up to layer 0: 1.
- Up to layer 1: 1 + 6 = 7.
- Up to layer 2: 7 + 12 = 19.
- Up to layer `n`: 1 + 6*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 3n(n+1).

### Finding the Layer Containing 2026

We need to find which layer `n` contains the number 2026. That is, find the smallest `n` such that the total numbers up to layer `n` is >= 2026.

So, solve for `n` in:

1 + 3n(n + 1) >= 2026
3n² + 3n + 1 >= 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 >= 0
n² + n - 675 >= 0

Solving the quadratic equation n² + n - 675 = 0:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)] / 2

sqrt(2701) ≈ 51.98, so:

n ≈ (-1 + 51.98)/2 ≈ 25.49

So, n ≈ 25. Let's check n=25 and n=26:

For n=25:
Total numbers = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

For n=26:
Total numbers = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

2026 is between 1951 and 2107, so it's in layer 26.

### Determining the Position of 2026 in Layer 26

Layer 26 starts at 1952 (since up to layer 25 is 1951) and ends at 2107.

So, the position of 2026 in layer 26 is:

2026 - 1951 = 75 (since layer 26 has 6*26=156 numbers, from 1952 to 2107)

Wait, no: layer 26 starts at 1952, so position is 2026 - 1951 = 75.

But layer 26 has 156 numbers (from 1952 to 2107), so 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26.

### Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral's Numbering

Now, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in the hexagonal spiral. Each layer `n` forms a hexagon with six sides, each side having `n` numbers (except possibly the first side which might have `n+1` to account for the corner).

From the given example:

Layer 1 (n=1): 6 numbers, each side has 1 number (but seems like sides have 1 or 2 numbers to form a hexagon).

Actually, it's better to think that each layer `n` has 6 sides, and each side has `n` numbers, but the corners are shared, so total numbers per layer is 6n.

For layer 2 (n=2): 12 numbers, so each side has 2 numbers (but corners are shared, so sides have 2 numbers each, totaling 6*2 - 6 = 6, which doesn't add up. Maybe sides have n numbers, and corners are counted twice, so total is 6n.

Given that, let's assume that in layer `n`, the numbers are arranged in six segments, each of length `n`, corresponding to the six sides of the hexagon.

So, layer 26 has six sides, each with 26 numbers, totaling 156 numbers.

### Identifying the Side and Position Within the Side

2026 is the 75th number in layer 26 (since 2026 - 1951 = 75).

Each side has 26 numbers, so:

75 / 26 ≈ 2 with a remainder of 23.

So, it's the 23rd number on the 3rd side (since sides are 1 to 6, and we've counted 2 full sides: 2*26=52, and then 75-52=23 on the next side).

### Determining the Neighbors of 2026

In a hexagonal grid, each number has six neighbors: one in the previous layer, one in the next layer, and four in the same layer (two on the same side, one on the previous side, and one on the next side).

Given that 2026 is the 23rd number on the 3rd side of layer 26:

1. **Previous layer neighbor (layer 25):** This is the number in layer 25 that is adjacent to the start of the side where 2026 is. For the 3rd side, it's the last number of the 3rd side of layer 25.

   Layer 25 has 6*25=150 numbers, starting at 1 + 3*24*25 + 1 = 1 + 1800 + 1 = 1802 (since up to layer 24 is 1 + 3*24*25 = 1801).

   Wait, no: up to layer n is 1 + 3n(n+1). So up to layer 24 is 1 + 3*24*25 = 1801.

   So layer 25 is 1802 to 1951 (150 numbers).

   The 3rd side of layer 25 is numbers 1802 + 2*25 to 1802 + 3*25 - 1 = 1852 to 1876.

   The last number of the 3rd side is 1876.

   So, the previous layer neighbor is 1876.

2. **Next layer neighbor (layer 27):** This is the first number of the 3rd side of layer 27.

   Layer 27 starts at 2108 (since up to layer 26 is 2107).

   The 3rd side starts at 2108 + 2*27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162.

   So, the next layer neighbor is 2162.

3. **Same layer neighbors:**
   - **Previous number on the same side:** 2025 (since 2026 is the 23rd, 2025 is the 22nd).
   - **Next number on the same side:** 2027 (if it exists; since the side has 26 numbers, 2027 is the 24th, so it exists).
   - **Number on the previous side (side 2):** The last number of side 2 is 1951 + 2*26 = 1951 + 52 = 2003. Then the next numbers are the first numbers of side 3, which are 2004, 2005, etc. So the neighbor from the previous side is the last number of side 2, which is 2003.
   - **Number on the next side (side 4):** The first number of side 4 is 1951 + 3*26 = 1951 + 78 = 2029. So the neighbor from the next side is 2029.

Wait, let's clarify the same layer neighbors:

In a hexagonal spiral, for a number on side `s` at position `p` (1-based), the same-layer neighbors are:

- Previous number on the same side: `current - 1` (if `p > 1`).
- Next number on the same side: `current + 1` (if `p < n`).
- Number on the previous side: the last number of side `s-1`.
- Number on the next side: the first number of side `s+1`.

For 2026, which is side 3, position 23:

- Previous number on same side: 2025.
- Next number on same side: 2027.
- Previous side (side 2) last number: 1951 + 2*26 = 2003.
- Next side (side 4) first number: 1951 + 3*26 = 2029.

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let's list all six neighbors of 2026:

1. Previous layer: 1876.
2. Next layer: 2162.
3. Same layer:
   - Previous on same side: 2025.
   - Next on same side: 2027.
   - Previous side: 2003.
   - Next side: 2029.

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these six neighbors:

1876 + 2162 + 2025 + 2027 + 2003 + 2029

Let's calculate step by step:

1876 + 2162 = 4038
4038 + 2025 = 6063
6063 + 2027 = 8090
8090 + 2003 = 10093
10093 + 2029 = 12122

### Final Answer

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is **12122**.
