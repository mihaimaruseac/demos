Let's carefully analyze the given hexagonal spiral and determine the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026.

---

### Step 1: Understand the structure

The problem shows part of a hexagonal spiral:

```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

It appears that the numbers are arranged in layers around 1, forming concentric hexagonal rings.

---

### Step 2: Recognize the pattern

- The center is **1**.
- The first ring around 1 contains numbers 2 to 6.
- The second ring contains numbers 7 to 19.
- The third ring continues in a similar pattern, and so on.

In general, the hexagonal spiral can be described by **hexagonal numbers**:

\[ H_k = 3k(k-1) + 1 \]

which counts the total number of cells within the first \(k\) layers (including the center).

- When \(k=1\), \(H_1=1\)
- When \(k=2\), \(H_2=3 \times 2 \times 1 + 1=7\)
- When \(k=3\), \(H_3=3 \times 3 \times 2 +1=19\)
- When \(k=4\), \(H_4=3 \times 4 \times 3 +1=37\), etc.

---

### Step 3: Locate the layer of 2026

Find \(k\) such that:

\[
H_k \leq 2026 < H_{k+1}
\]
\[
3k(k-1)+1 \leq 2026 < 3(k+1)k + 1
\]

Solve \(3k(k-1)+1 \leq 2026\):

\[
3k(k-1) \leq 2025
\]

\[
k(k-1) \leq 675
\]

Estimate \(k\):

For \(k=25\), \(25 \times 24=600 \leq 675\) — OK.

For \(k=26\), \(26 \times 25=650 \leq 675\) — OK, but close.

For \(k=27\), \(27 \times 26=702 > 675\) — too big.

So, \(k=26\):

\[
H_{26} = 3 \times 26 \times 25 + 1 = 3 \times 650 + 1 = 1951
\]

Similarly,

\[
H_{27} = 3 \times 27 \times 26 + 1 = 3 \times 702 + 1 = 2107
\]

Since 2026 is between 1951 and 2107, the number 2026 lies in **layer \(k=26\)**.

---

### Step 4: Find the position of 2026 within the layer

- The total numbers up to layer 25: \(H_{25} = 3 \times 25 \times 24 + 1 = 3 \times 600 + 1=1801\)
- So, numbers in layer 26 are from \(H_{25}+1=1802\) up to \(H_{26}=1951\), but wait, our previous calculation shows:

\[
H_{26} = 1951; \quad H_{27} = 2107
\]

Number of elements in layer 26:

\[
H_{26} - H_{25} = 1951 - 1801 = 150
\]

The numbers in layer 26 are from 1802 up to 1951.

But we see our target number 2026 is **greater** than 1951, meaning it's in **layer 27**:

\[
H_{27} = 2107
\]
and

\[
H_{26} = 1951
\]

Number of elements in layer 27:

\[
H_{27} - H_{26} = 2107 - 1951 = 156
\]

Number 2026 is between 1952 and 2107, thus in **layer \(k=27\)**.

### Summary:

- Layer \(k=26\) ends at 1951.
- Layer \(k=27\) starts at 1952 and ends at 2107.
- 2026 is within layer 27.

Number of elements from layer \(k=26\):

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

Therefore, **2026** is the 75th cell in layer 27 (starting at 1952).

---

### Step 5: Coordinates and neighbors in the hexagon

In a regular hexagonal grid, each cell (numbered in layers) has up to 6 neighbors. For a given cell, these neighbors are on the same layer or on adjacent layers, and their positions follow a known pattern.

**Key insight:**

- The "center" cell is 1.
- Each layer adds a ring of cells around the previous.
- The positions of neighbors can be identified based on the index within the layer.

---

### Step 6: Pattern of neighbor relationships

- For the outer layers, the "corner" cells are at specific positions.
  
- For a cell at position \(p\) in layer \(k\), its neighbors typically include:

  - Adjacent cells on the same layer,
  - Cells from inner layer (\(k-1\)),
  - Cells from outer layer (\(k+1\)).

But due to the spiral construction, the neighbor pattern is consistent:

- The six neighbors of each cell are generally:

1. The cell preceding it on the same layer,
2. The cell following it on the same layer,
3. The cell in the previous layer directly "inside" it,
4. The cell in the previous layer "along" the direction of its position,
5. The cell in the next layer "outside" it,
6. The cell in the next layer "along" in the other direction.

---

### Step 7: Simplify — Recognize the uniformity

Instead of complex coordinate calculations, note that:

- Within the layer structure, each number's neighbors can be traced in a well-known pattern.

- The first layer (k=1) contains 1, and the subsequent layers steadily add a ring of size \(6k\).

- The numbers in each layer are ordered around the center.

Given the symmetry, the neighbor numbers of 2026 are:

- The previous and next numbers in the same layer (indices),
- The corresponding "inner" neighbors from layer 26,
- The corresponding "outer" neighbors from layer 28 (if they exist).

---

### Step 8: Find the neighbors explicitly

Since the spiral labels are sequential:

- Layer \(k=27\): contains 6×27=162 numbers, starting from 1952 up to 2107.

Number of elements up to layer 26: 1951

Number of elements up to layer 27: 2107

Number of elements in layer 27: 156

Within this layer:

- The first element is 1952,
- The last is 2107.

Calculate the position of 2026:

\[
2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75
\]

- Position 75 in layer 27.

---

### Step 9: Pattern in neighbor relations

Given the regularity of the hex spiral, the **six neighbors** of the 75th cell in the layer are:

1. The previous cell in the same layer: position 74 \(\Rightarrow\) 1952 + 74 = 2025
2. The next cell in the same layer: position 76 \(\Rightarrow\) 1952 + 76 = 2027
3. The inner layer neighbors: two adjacent in layer 26
4. The outer layer neighbors: two adjacent in layer 28

But as the numbering is sequential, and the total counts are known, **the neighbors** of a cell are:

- The cell at position \(p-1\),
- The cell at position \(p+1\),
- Two "inner" neighbors (from layer \(k-1\)),
- Two "outer" neighbors (from layer \(k+1\)).

The inner and outer neighbor positions are determined by the position \(p\), divided proportionally because each layer's perimeter is 6k.

---

### **Step 10: Use layer perimeter and proportionality**

Total cells in layer 27: 162.

- The layer perimeter is partitioned into 6 sides, each with length \(k=27\).

- The position in the layer corresponds to a side, and the neighbors can be found accordingly.

- The six neighbors correspond to:

  1. \(p-1\) (same layer)
  2. \(p+1\) (same layer)
  3. \(p_{inner}\) (on layer 26)
  4. \(p_{inner+1}\) (on layer 26)
  5. \(p_{outer}\) (layer 28)
  6. \(p_{outer+1}\) (layer 28)

---

### **Key realization:**

In the standard hex spiral, the numbers of neighboring cells relate to their positions modulo the side length.

Given the side length \(k=27\):

- The position \(p=75\)

- The position on the perimeter can be modulo 27:

\[
p' = (p-1) \bmod 27 = (75 - 1) \bmod 27 = 74 \bmod 27
\]

Calculate:

\[
27 \times 2 = 54, \quad 74 - 54=20
\]

So,

\[
p' = 20
\]

which indicates that the 75th cell lies on side \(s= \lfloor 20/27 \rfloor = 0\) (first side), and offset 20 within that side.

---

### **Step 11: Final calculation**

Using known formulas for hex spiral neighbor relations, the neighbors of cell at position \(p\) are:

- \(p-1\): the immediate previous cell in the same layer (\(p > 1\))
- \(p+1\): the immediate next cell in the same layer
- Two neighboring "inner" layer cells,
- Two neighboring "outer" layer cells.

In particular, for the 75th cell, the neighbors are:

- Inner layer neighbor: \(p_{inner} = p - \text{(side length)}\)

- Outer layer neighbor: \(p_{outer} = p + \text{(side length)}\)

Given the last, because the total number of cells in layer 26 (inner) is:

\[
H_{26} - H_{25} = 1951 - 1801 = 150
\]

Similarly, layer 28 has:

\[
H_{28} - H_{27} = (3 \times 28 \times 27 + 1) - 2107 = (3 \times 756 + 1) - 2107 = 2269 - 2107 = 162
\]

Which confirms the side length of both inner and outer layers are 27.

Assuming the neighbor positions:

- Inner neighbors:

\[
P_{inner,1} = p - 27
\]
\[
P_{inner,2} = p - 26
\]

- Outer neighbors:

\[
P_{outer,1} = p + 27
\]
\[
P_{outer,2} = p + 28
\]

---

### **Check bounds:**

- \(p=75\),
- \(p-27=48\),
- \(p-26=49\),
- \(p+27=102\),
- \(p+28=103\).

Numbering of inner layer: from 1802 to 1951.

- As inner layer cells correspond to earlier numbers: 

Inner neighbors (cells at positions 48 and 49) within layer 26: total 150, starting at 1802, so:

\[
\text{Number at inner position }=1801 + p_{inner}
\]

Similarly, outer layer neighbors at positions 102 and 103:

- Layer 28 starts at 2108, so their actual labels:

\[
2108 + (p_{outer} - 1) = 2108 + 102 - 1 = 2108 + 101= 2209
\]
\[
2108 + 103 - 1= 2108 + 102= 2210
\]

This gives the neighbor cell numbers:

- Inner layer neighbors: 1801 + 48 = 1849 and 1801 + 49=1850

- Outer layer neighbors: 2209 and 2210

---

### **Step 12: List neighbors of 2026**

Neighbors:

- Same layer neighbors: 2025 (p=74), 2027 (p=76)

- Inner neighbors: 1849, 1850

- Outer neighbors: 2209, 2210

---

### **Step 13: Sum all neighbors**

\[
\boxed{
\text{Sum} = 2025 + 2027 + 1849 + 1850 + 2209 + 2210
}
\]

Calculate:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(1849 + 1850 = 3699\)
- \(2209 + 2210 = 4420\)

Sum:

\[
4052 + 3699 + 4420 = (4052 + 3699) + 4420 = 7751 + 4420 = 12171
\]

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{\boxed{12171}}
\]

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is **12,171**.
