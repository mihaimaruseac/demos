Let's understand the problem carefully:

**Setup:**
- Natural numbers are arranged along a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid.
- The numbers increase along the spiral.
- The layout is such that each number (except possibly at the start) has up to six neighbors (since it's a hex grid).
- The example snippet shows part of such a grid:

```
       ... 14  4   3  10 ...
       ... 15  5   1   2   9 ...
       ... 16  6   7   8 ...
```

We are asked to find the **sum of all six neighbors** of the number **2026** in this spiral.

---

### Step 1: Recognize the pattern of the numbering spiral

The key technique:

- The numbers are arranged in "rings" or "layers" around the starting point (which is usually at 1).
- The pattern of how the numbers are mapped in the spiral is similar to a hexagonal spiral.

Given the pattern, the spiral likely starts at 1 at the center and grows outward in concentric hexagonal layers.

### Step 2: Understanding the number placement

The layout resembles the known "hexagonal number spiral" where:

- Each ring \( n \) contains \( 6n \) new numbers.
- The total numbers up to ring \( n \):

\[
\text{Total numbers up to ring } n = 1 + 6 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

**Verification:**

- For ring 1: total numbers = \( 1 + 3 \times 1 \times 2 = 1 + 6 = 7 \) (numbers 2 through 7 occupy the first ring)
- For ring 2: total numbers = \( 1 + 3 \times 2 \times 3 = 1 + 18 = 19 \), and so forth.

But we need to verify the exact numbering:

- The starting point is at 1 (center).
- The next layer (ring 1) contains numbers 2 through 7 (6 numbers).
- Next layer (ring 2): 8 through 19 (12 numbers), etc.

### Step 3: Find the ring for 2026

Find the ring \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 3 n(n+1) \geq 2026
\]

\[
3 n(n+1) \geq 2025
\]

\[
n(n+1) \geq 675
\]

Solve for \( n \):

Quadratic inequality:

\[
n^2 + n - 675 \geq 0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta = 1^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-675) = 1 + 2700 = 2701
\]

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96\)

So:

\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} \approx \frac{50.96}{2} \approx 25.48
\]

Since \( n \) must be integer, the smallest \( n \) satisfying the inequality is \( n=26 \).

Check for \( n=25 \):

\[
3 \times 25 \times 26 = 3 \times 650 = 1950
\]
Total numbers up to ring 25:

\[
1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

Number 2026 is > 1951, so in ring 26.

Total numbers up to ring 26:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

Since 2026 is between 1951 and 2107, it lies in **ring 26**.

---

### Step 4: Find the position (order) of 2026 within ring 26

Numbers up to ring 25: 1951.

Numbers in ring 26:

- The 26th ring has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers.

- The first number in ring 26 (the starting point on that layer):

\[
\text{Number at start of ring 26} = 1951 + 1 = 1952
\]

Number 1952 corresponds to the first position in ring 26.

Number 2026:

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

So, 2026 is the 74th number in ring 26, starting counting from 1 at 1952.

Total numbers in ring 26:

- Positions 1 to 156.

Thus, 2026 is at position:

\[
\text{Position in ring } 26 = 74
\]

---

### Step 5: Geometrical properties and neighbor determination

In a perfect hexagonal spiral:

- Each layer (or ring) forms a hexagon.
- The six sides of the hexagon each contain \( n \) numbers (or \( n \) + 1 at the corners).

To find neighbors:

- The central point (number 1) has six neighbors.
- Numbers along each side are connected in order.
  
For a number at position \( p \) on ring \( n \):

- The hexagon has 6 sides.
- The first number of each side (starting point) can be calculated.
- The neighbors are the previous and next numbers along the side, as well as adjacent sides.

---

### Step 6: Finding neighbors of 2026

Given the ring number \( n=26 \), the position \( p=74 \).

The side length:

\[
\text{Side length} = n = 26
\]

Total numbers in ring:

\[
6 \times n = 156
\]

The positions:

- Side 1: positions 1 to 26
- Side 2: 27 to 52
- Side 3: 53 to 78
- Side 4: 79 to 104
- Side 5: 105 to 130
- Side 6: 131 to 156

Number 74:

- \( p=74 \), which lies in side 3:

\[
\text{Side 3} \text{ range }: 53 \leq p \leq 78
\]

Calculate position within side 3:

\[
p_{\text{side}} = p - 52 = 74 - 52 = 22
\]

So, within side 3, position 22.

---

### Step 7: Determine the neighbors

In the hexagonal arrangement, each point (on the side) has up to six neighbors:

- The predecessor and successor along the side.
- Two neighbors from adjacent sides.
- The two corner points where sides meet.

The standard neighbor relationships in such a spiral are:

- For an internal point (not at corners):

  - Two neighbors along the same side: previous and next positions.
  - Two neighbors at corners: the adjacent corner points of neighboring sides.

- For points at corners (positions where sides meet), the neighbors expand accordingly.

**Assigning neighbors:**

- **Neighbors along side 3:**
  - Previous in side 3 (if \( p_{\text{side}} >1 \))
  - Next in side 3 (if \( p_{\text{side}} < n \))

- **Neighbors at the corners:**
  - For side 3, the "corner" points are at position 1 and position 26:
    - Corner at start of side 3: position 53
    - Corner at end of side 3: position 78

Since \( p_{\text{side}}=22 \):

- Not at a corner, so neighbors:

  - Side neighbors: position 21 and 23 within side 3.
  - Adjacent sides: connect to the previous and next sides at their respective corners.

Now:

- The **neighbor at position 21** (within side 3).
- The **neighbor at position 23** (within side 3).

Additionally, neighbors at the "vertices" (the corner points):

- The corner at position 53 (start of side 3).
- The corner at position 78 (end of side 3).

These corner points connect to neighboring sides:

- The start corner (53) connects to side 2 if considering the layout.
- The end corner (78) connects to side 4.

---

### **Key step:** Find the numbering positions of the neighbors of 2026.

---

### Step 8: Find the positions and numbers of neighbors

From the known knowledge of hex spiral arrangements, the six neighbors of a point on ring \( n \) at position \( p \) are:

1. The previous point in the same side (unless at the start of the side).

2. The next point in the same side (unless at the end of the side).

3. The corner point at the start of the side (the one at position 53).

4. The corner point at the end of the side (the one at position 78).

5. The neighbor in the previous side at the same "level" (connected via corner crossing).

6. The neighbor in the next side at the same "level".

Given that, the neighbors are arranged as follows:

- **Side 3: positions 53 to 78**

- Our number: position 74, within side 3.

Thus, neighbors:

- Along side 3:

  - Previous: position 73

  - Next: position 75

- Corners:

  - Start corner (side 3 start): position 53

  - End corner (side 3 end): position 78

- Adjacent side neighbors:

  \[
  \text{From side 2 and side 4}
  \]

---

### Step 9: Map neighbor positions to number values

Calculate the number at position \( p=74 \):

- Number of numbers in ring 25: up to position 1951

- First in side 3: position 53 (start of side 3)

- The number at position \( p=74 \):

Recall that positions in ring 26:

- Side 3 starts at position 53 (number 1952 + 52 = 2004)

Because:

- First in ring 26:

\[
1952
\]

- Position in ring 26:

\[
p = 74
\]

- Within side 3:

\[
p_{\text{side}} = 22
\]

Number at position \( p \):

\[
= 1951 + p
\]

Check:

Number at position 1 in ring 26:

\[
1952
\]

Number at position 74:

\[
1951 + 74 = 2025
\]

But earlier, in calculating total numbers:

- Total numbers up to ring 25: 1951.

- First in ring 26: 1952.

- Therefore, position 74 in ring 26 corresponds to number:

\[
1951 + 74 = 2025
\]

But wait, the initial calculation of 2026 was based on offset, so the number at position 74 (i.e., order in ring 26):

\[
\text{Number} = 1951 + p
\]

Therefore, **number 2025** is at position 74 in ring 26.

Since the number of interest is 2026, it is at position:

\[
p = 2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

So **2026 is at position 75** in ring 26.

Correcting earlier:

- Number 1952 is at position 1 in ring 26,
- Therefore, number 2026 at position:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

- Number at position 75.

Thus:

**Number 2026 is at position 75** in ring 26.

Update the side position:

- Position in ring 26: 75
- Positions per side: 26
- Side 1: positions 1-26 (corrsponds to positions 1-26)
- Side 2: 27-52
- Side 3: 53-78
- Side 4: 79-104
- Side 5: 105-130
- Side 6: 131-156

Calculate side of position 75:

\[
\text{Side} = \left\lfloor \frac{p-1}{n} \right\rfloor + 1
\]

Because:

\[
p=75,\quad n=26
\]
Calculate:

\[
p-1=74
\]
Divided by 26:

\[
74/26 \approx 2.846
\]
Floor:

\[
2
\]

Side:

\[
2 + 1 = 3
\]

So, position 75 is on **side 3** (which runs from positions 53-78):

- Within side 3:

\[
p_{\text{side}} = p - ( ( \text{side} -1) \times n ) + 1
\]

But more precise:

Since:

- Side 1: positions 1-26

- Side 2: positions 27-52

- Side 3: positions 53-78

Number of positions before side 3:

\[
(3-1) \times 26 = 52
\]

Therefore, position in side 3:

\[
p_{\text{side}}=75 - 52 = 23
\]

(Positions within side 3 range from 1 to 26)

---

### **Summary so far:**

- Number \( 2026 \) is at position:

  \[
  p=75
  \]

- On side 3:

  \[
  p_{\text{side}}=23
  \]

---

### Step 10: Find the neighbors

Neighbors:

- **Along side 3:**

  - Previous: position 22

  - Next: position 24

- **Corner points:**

  - Start of side 3: position 53

  - End of side 3: position 78

  - Number at position 53: the start corner.

  - Number at position 78: the end corner.

Number at position:

\[
= 1951 + p
\]

- For position 53:

\[
1951 + 53 = 2004
\]

- For position 78:

\[
1951 + 78 = 2029
\]

Similarly:

- For position 22:

\[
1951 + 22 = 1973
\]

- For position 24:

\[
1951 + 24 = 1975
\]

---

### **Neighbors for number 2026:**

Total six possible neighbors:

1. Previous in side 3: number at position 22 (1973)

2. Next in side 3: number at position 24 (1975)

3. Corner at start of side 3: position 53 (2004)

4. Corner at end of side 3: position 78 (2029)

Next, the two neighboring "corner crossings" linking adjacent sides:

- Number adjacent via side crossing at position 52 (end of side 2):

  - Position 52: position:

  \[
  (2-1) \times 26 + 52 = 26 + 52=78
  \]

But we already have position 78 as the end of side 3, which is at number 2029.

Similarly, the neighbor across the corner from sides 2 and 4:

- For side 2:

  Positions 27-52

- For side 4:

  Positions 79-104

Number at position 79:

\[
1951 + 79 = 2030
\]

Number at position 52:

\[
1951 + 52=2003
\]

Some references indicate that in hex spiral arrangements, each number's six neighbors are:

- Previous in the same side: position 22

- Next in the same side: position 24

- The two neighboring corners: positions 53 and 78

- The neighbors across the corners are:

   - The "upstream" corner (from previous side), which is at position 52 in side 2 (number 2003), connecting to position 53 in side 3 (number 2004).

   - The "downstream" corner (from next side), associated with position 79, number 2030.

Given that, the six neighbors of 2026 are:

- 1973 (pos 22)

- 1975 (pos 24)

- 2004 (corner start of side 3)

- 2029 (corner end of side 3)

- 2003 (corner of previous side, side 2, position 52)

- 2030 (corner of next side, side 4, position 79)

---

### **Final step: sum these six neighbors**

Numbers:

\[
1973,\quad 1975,\quad 2004,\quad 2029,\quad 2003,\quad 2030
\]

Sum:

Let's compute step-by-step:

\[
1973 + 1975 = 3948
\]

\[
3948 + 2004 = 5952
\]

\[
5952 + 2029= 7981
\]

\[
7981 + 2003= 9984
\]

\[
9984 + 2030= 12014
\]

---

## **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12014}
\]

The sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 in the described hexagonal spiral layout is **12014**.
