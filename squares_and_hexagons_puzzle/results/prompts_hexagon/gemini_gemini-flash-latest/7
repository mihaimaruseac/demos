Here is a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026 on the hexagonal spiral.

## 1. Analyze the Spiral Pattern and Square Numbers

The spiral lays out the natural numbers on a hexagonal grid. A key feature of these hexagonal spirals is that the numbers along the main axes (or "corners" of the hexagonal layers) correspond to perfect squares or numbers very close to perfect squares.

Let's examine the numbers at the corners of the first few layers:

| Layer (k) | Starting Number (Top Right) | Top Corner | Top Left Corner | Bottom Left Corner | Bottom Corner | Bottom Right Corner | End Number (Next layer starts at $k^2+1$) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| k=1 | $1$ (Center) | - | - | - | - | - | $1$ |
| k=2 | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $9$ ($3^2$) |
| k=3 | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $13$ | $14$ | $15$ | $25$ ($5^2$) |
| k=4 | $26$ | $27$ | $28$ | $29$ | $30$ | $31$ | $49$ ($7^2$) |

In general, the $k$-th layer ends at $(2k-1)^2$. The side length of the $k$-th layer is $2k-2$ (the number of steps between corners).

## 2. Locate the Number 2026

We need to find the perfect square closest to 2026.

$40^2 = 1600$
$50^2 = 2500$

Let's check numbers close to $\sqrt{2026}$:
$45^2 = 2025$

Since $45$ is an odd number, $N = 45^2 = 2025$ corresponds to the end of a spiral layer.
This is the $(k)$-th layer, where $2k-1 = 45$, so $2k = 46$, and $k=23$.

The $23$rd layer ends at $2025$.

The next layer (Layer 24) starts at $2026$.

## 3. Determine the Position of 2026

The number $N_{start} = 2026$ is the **starting number** of Layer 24.
The position of the starting number is always one step **Up and Right** (Top Right) from the preceding square number ($2025$).

Let $P$ be the position of $2026$. We need to find its 6 neighbors.

## 4. Find the Neighbors of the Starting Number

Let $S_{k} = (2k-1)^2$ be the number at the end of layer $k$.
The starting number of layer $k+1$ is $N_{k+1} = S_k + 1$.

Let's look at the neighbors of the starting number $N=10$ (Layer 3 start) in the provided layout:

... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...

$N=10$. Its neighbors are:
1. Below: $9$
2. Down-Left: $2$
3. Up-Left: $3$
4. Above: $11$ (Not explicitly shown, but $10$ is followed by $11$)
5. Up-Right: (Next layer number)
6. Down-Right: (Previous layer number)

Wait, the initial layout shows $10$ is adjacent to $3$, $9$, $2$, $15$. Let's re-examine the positions:

$10$ is located one step Top-Right from $9$.

| Position | Neighbor of 10 | Relation to $S_2 = 9$ | General Formula (S=2025) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Above (Top) | $11$ | $S+2$ | $2025 + 2 = 2027$ |
| Up-Left (TL) | $3$ | $S - (S - S_{TL})$ | This is complicated. Let's use position relative to $S$. |
| Left (L) | $4$ | $S - 5$ | The corner is $S-4$. $S-5$. $2025 - 5 = 2020$ |
| Down-Left (BL) | $15$ | $S + 6$ | This seems wrong based on the layout. Let's re-identify the corners. |
| Below (B) | $9$ | $S$ | $2025$ |
| Down-Right (BR) | $2$ | $S - 7$ | This is also complicated. |

Let's use the established relationship based on the coordinates of the square number $S=2025$.

$S=2025$ is the last number of Layer 23, located at the Bottom-Right corner.
$N=2026$ is located one step $Up-Right$ from $2025$.

If $S=2025$:
1. $2026$ (N) is Up-Right of $S$.
2. $2025$ (S) is Down-Left of $N$.
3. The number **Above** $S$ is $S + (2k-2) = S + 44$. This is the Bottom Corner: $2025-22 = 2003$. Let's stick to simple relative positions.

Let $S = 2025$. The neighbors of $N=2026$ are:

| Neighbor Position | Value (V) | Relation to S=2025 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1. Below (Down-Left) | $S = 2025$ | This is the number $N-1$. |
| 2. Left | $V_L$ | This number is on the previous layer. |
| 3. Up-Left | $V_{UL}$ | This number is on the previous layer. |
| 4. Above | $N+1 = 2027$ | This is the next number in the spiral layer. |
| 5. Up-Right | $N+2 = 2028$ | This is the number after that (often a neighbor in this pattern). |
| 6. Down-Right | $V_{DR}$ | This number is on the previous layer. |

We need to find $V_L, V_{UL}, V_{DR}$.

The side length of Layer $k=23$ is $L_{23} = 2k-2 = 44$.
The corners of Layer 23 are separated by $L_{23}/6 = 44/6$. Wait, this is for a normal hexagon. For this square spiral pattern mapped to a hex grid, the corners are separated by $L_{23}/4 = 11$. No, the sides are equal length.

The spiral side length is $44$. Total steps in Layer 23 is $4 \times 44 = 176$.
Layer 23 runs from $S_{22}+1 = 1849+1 = 1850$ up to $S_{23}=2025$.

$2025 - 1850 + 1 = 176$ numbers. Correct.

$S=2025$ is the **Bottom Right Corner** of the structure defined by $45 \times 45$.

Let $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ be the corners of Layer 23 (starting counter-clockwise from Top-Right).
The side length is $L=44$.

$C_1$ (Top-Right): $S - 3L/4 = 2025 - 33 = 1992$. (This is $44^2$). No.

The corners of the layer $k$ are defined relative to the side length $L=2k-2$.
$S_{k} = (2k-1)^2$.
$S_{k-1} = (2k-3)^2$.

Let's use $L=44$.

The sequence of corners in Layer 23, starting just before $2026$:
$N_{start} = (2k-3)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850$. This is $C_1$. (Top-Right of inner square).

The length of the current side (Layer 23) is $L=44$.
1. $C_1$ (Top-Right): $1850$.
2. $C_2$ (Top-Left): $1850 + 44 = 1894$.
3. $C_3$ (Bottom-Left): $1894 + 44 = 1938$.
4. $C_4$ (Bottom): $1938 + 44 = 1982$.
5. $C_5$ (Bottom-Right): $1982 + 44 = 2026$. Wait, this structure counts 4 corners/sides only.

We are dealing with a spiral laid on a *hexagonal* grid. This means it has 6 sides/corners per layer.

Let $L_{hex}$ be the length of one side of the hexagonal layer $k$.
Total steps is $6 \times L_{hex}$. $S_k - S_{k-1} = 6L_{k-1}$.
$45^2 - 43^2 = 2025 - 1849 = 176$.
$6 L_{23} = 176$. $L_{23} = 176/6$. Not an integer.

This confirms the standard hexagonal spiral pattern ends on the corners of squares (odd squares) and the sides are **not** equal length in terms of number count.

Let $R_k$ be the number of steps in revolution $k$. $R_k = S_k - S_{k-1}$. $R_{23} = 176$.

Let's re-examine the example (Layer 2, ends at 9, $k=2, 2k-1=3$):
$S_1=1$. $S_2=9$. $R_2 = 8$.

1. Start (2): Top-Right
2. Corner 1 (3): Top. (1 step)
3. Corner 2 (4): Top-Left. (1 step)
4. Corner 3 (5): Bottom-Left. (1 step)
5. Corner 4 (6): Bottom. (1 step)
6. Corner 5 (7): Bottom-Right. (1 step)
7. Corner 6 (8): Right (or Center-Right). (1 step)
8. End (9): Down-Right. (1 step). Wait, 9 is Up-Right from 8. This is confusing.

Let's rely purely on the coordinate system for the spiral relative to $S=2025$.

$N = 2026$ is the first number of a new revolution.
$S = 2025$ is the last number of the previous revolution.

The coordinates:
Let $C(n)$ be the coordinates of number $n$. $C(1)=(0,0)$.
$C(2025)$ is at some $(x, y)$.
$C(2026)$ is typically one step Up and Right from $C(2025)$.

Crucially, in this standard odd-square hexagonal spiral (where squares $N^2$ are always on the axes):
$S=2025$ is the number found at the position $(+22, -23)$ or similar, based on how the spiral turns. It is located just before the Bottom-Right axis turn.

**The structure of the neighbors around the start of a layer ($N=S+1$):**

Let $S=(2k-1)^2$. $N=S+1$.

| Position | Neighbor | Value |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | The preceding square | $S$ |
| 2 | The number immediately before the axis turn, $S - L_{side} $ | $V_A$ |
| 3 | The corner before $S$ | $V_B$ |
| 4 | The next number | $N+1$ |
| 5 | The number $N+L_{side}$ | $V_C$ |
| 6 | A diagonal neighbor on the new layer | $V_D$ |

Let $k=23$. $2k-1=45$. $S=2025$. Side length $L$ of the square grid is $45$.

The numbers $N^2$ lie on the diagonal $y=-x$ (or equivalent).
$S=2025 = 45^2$.

Let's find the values of the corners $C_1, \dots, C_6$ of the spiral layer that $S$ and $N$ belong to.

The numbers $N^2$ lie on the axis that goes Down-Right from the center.
The structure must be symmetric. Let $M=2k-1=45$.

The corners of the $M \times M$ square are typically:
$M^2$: Bottom Right axis ($2025$).
$M^2 - (M-1)$: Bottom Left axis ($2025 - 44 = 1981$).
$M^2 - 2(M-1)$: Top Left axis ($1981 - 44 = 1937$).
$M^2 - 3(M-1)$: Top Right axis ($1937 - 44 = 1893$).
$M^2 - 4(M-1)$: Right axis ($1893 - 44 = 1849$). This is $(M-2)^2$.

Let $S_{out} = 2025$. This number is on the bottom-right axis.

The neighbors of $N=2026$ (which is $S_{out}+1$, located Up-Right of $S_{out}$):

1. **Down-Left Neighbor:** $S_{out} = 2025$.

2. **Left Neighbor ($V_L$):** This neighbor is on the vertical axis (Bottom axis).
This axis is defined by numbers $S_{out} - (M-1)/2, S_{out} - (M-1)/2 - 1, \dots$.
Let $M=45$. $(M-1)/2 = 22$.
The center point of the Bottom side is $C_{B} = S_{out} - (M-1) = 1981$.
Wait, $S_{out}=2025$ is the vertex. $C_B$ should be $2025 - 22 = 2003$.

The numbers on the axes of the square structure for $M=45$:
$A_{BR} = 2025$.
$A_{B} = 2003$. (Middle of the bottom side)
$A_{BL} = 1981$. (Bottom-Left corner)
$A_{L} = 1959$. (Middle of the Left side)
$A_{TL} = 1937$. (Top-Left corner)
$A_{T} = 1915$. (Middle of the Top side)
$A_{TR} = 1893$. (Top-Right corner)
$A_{R} = 1871$. (Middle of the Right side)
$A_{R, inner} = 1849 = 43^2$. (Inner square end).

The number $S=2025$ is located at the $BR$ vertex. Its neighbors include:
a) The number $S-1$: $2024$ (Down axis).
b) The number $S - 2M + 3$: $2025 - 90 + 3 = 1938$. (A corner of the hex spiral)

Let's use the layout structure around $S=9$ and $N=10$. $M=3$. $(M-1)/2=1$.
$S=9$. $N=10$.
$C_{BR}=9$. $C_B=8$. $C_{BL}=7$. $C_L=6$. $C_{TL}=5$. $C_T=4$. $C_{TR}=3$. $C_R=2$. $S_{in}=1$.

Neighbors of $N=10$: $3, 4, 9, 2, 11, 15$. (From the diagram, 15 is BL of 9).

Let's verify the positions of 3, 4, 9, 2, 11, 15 relative to 10:

| N=10 Neighbor | Value | Relation to S=9 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1. Below (DL) | $9$ | $S$ |
| 2. Down-Right | $2$ | $S - (M+4)$ | (2 is $S-7$. $M=3$, $M+4=7$) |
| 3. Up-Left | $3$ | $S - (M+3)$ | (3 is $S-6$) |
| 4. Left | $4$ | $S - 5$ | ($4 = 9-5$) |
| 5. Above | $11$ | $S+2$ | ($11 = 9+2$) |
| 6. Up-Right | $15$ | $S+6$ | Wait, $15$ is $N+5$. This position must be the start of the next layer $S_{k+1}+1$. This is wrong. |

Looking closely at the layout:
3 is Top-Left of 10.
4 is Left of 10.
9 is Down-Left of 10.
2 is Below 9, but 10 is TR of 9. 2 is not adjacent to 10 in the standard layout.

The diagram implies:
4 3 10
5 1 2 9
6 7 8

If 10 is Up-Right of 9:
N(10) is adjacent to: 3 (TL), 4 (L), 9 (DL), $V_{DR}$, $V_R$, $V_{TR}$.

If the diagram shows the immediate neighbors of 10:
$N_1 = 3$
$N_2 = 4$
$N_3 = 9$
$N_4 = V_{R}$ (Must be $2$ based on the diagram placement)
$N_5 = V_{TR}$ (Must be $V_R$ of 3/TL of 10)
$N_6 = V_{T}$ (Must be the next number 11)

Let's map the coordinates for the center region carefully:
C(1)=(0,0)
C(2)=(1, 0) (R)
C(3)=(1, 1) (UR)
C(4)=(0, 1) (U)
C(5)=(-1, 1) (UL)
C(6)=(-1, 0) (L)
C(7)=(-1, -1) (DL)
C(8)=(0, -1) (D)
C(9)=(1, -1) (DR)
C(10)=(2, 0) (R) -> This assumes the spiral path continues R, UR, U, UL, L, DL, D, DR, R...

If 10 is (2, 0), its neighbors are:
(1, 0) -> 2
(1, 1) -> 3
(2, 1) -> 11 (N+1)
(3, 0) -> 12 (N+2)
(2, -1) -> 9
(1, -1) -> 9. Wait, C(9)=(1, -1). C(2)=(1, 0). C(10)=(2, 0).

Let's redraw based on standard hexagonal grid coordinates $(q, r)$:
$1: (0, 0)$
$2: (1, 0)$ (E)
$3: (1, 1)$ (NE)
$4: (0, 1)$ (N)
$5: (-1, 2)$ (NW)
Wait, standard hex coordinates: NE, N, NW, SW, S, SE.

$1: (0, 0)$
$2: (1, 0)$ (SE)
$3: (1, 1)$ (NE)
$4: (0, 1)$ (N)
$5: (-1, 2)$ (NW)
$6: (-1, 1)$ (W) -> (L)
$7: (0, -1)$ (S)
$8: (1, -2)$ (SE)
$9: (2, -2)$ (SE)
This is not matching the provided diagram layout:

$4 \quad 3 \quad 10$
$5 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 9$
$6 \quad 7 \quad 8$

Let's assume the provided diagram uses $H_1, H_2, \dots, H_6$ as the axes:
$1$ is center.
$2$ is $H_1$.
$3$ is $H_2$.
$4$ is $H_3$.
$5$ is $H_4$.
$6$ is $H_5$.
$7$ is $H_6$.
$8$ is $H_1$ extension.
$9$ is $H_1$ extension.
$10$ is $H_2$ extension.

$1: (0, 0)$
$2: (1, -1)$ (SE)
$3: (0, 1)$ (N)
$4: (-1, 1)$ (NW)
$5: (-2, 0)$ (W)
$6: (-1, -1)$ (SW)
$7: (0, -2)$ (S)
$8: (1, -2)$ (SE)
$9: (2, -3)$ (SE) - No, 9 is adjacent to 8.

Let's stick to the numerical relationship observed for $S=9$ and $N=10$.
$S = (2k-1)^2$. $N = S+1$.
$S=2025$. $N=2026$. $k=23$. $M=45$.

$N=10$ is adjacent to:
$N_1 = 9 = S$ (DL position)
$N_2 = 2$. $2$ is $S - 7 = 9-7$. (DR position)
$N_3 = 3$. $3$ is $S - 6 = 9-6$. (TL position)
$N_4 = 4$. $4$ is $S - 5 = 9-5$. (L position)
$N_5 = 11$. $11 = S + 2$. (T position, $N+1$)
$N_6 = 15$. $15$ is the starting number of the next layer, $S_{k+1}=25$. $15 = 25 - 10$. No simple relation.

Let's locate $N_6 = 15$. 15 is $25-10$. $S_{next}=25$. $M_{next}=5$. $L_{next}=4$.
$25$ is the DR corner of the $5 \times 5$ layer. $25$ is at $(3, -2)$.
$10$ is at $(2, 0)$.
$15$ is located at $(0, 2)$. It is $N$ of $14$. $15$ is TL of $10$.

Let's try the positions based on relative coordinates in the spiral:
$N$ is located $UR$ relative to $S$.

| Position Relative to N | Neighbor (N=10) | Value Formula (Relative to $M=2k-1$) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1. Down-Left (DL) | $S=9$ | $S$ |
| 2. Left (L) | $4$ | $S - (M+2) = 9-5$ |
| 3. Up-Left (UL) | $3$ | $S - (M+3) = 9-6$ |
| 4. Above (T) | $11$ | $S + 2$ |
| 5. Up-Right (UR) | $V_{UR}$ | (Must be $N+1$ in this arrangement) |
| 6. Down-Right (DR) | $2$ | $S - (2M+1) = 9-7$ |

Wait, $N=10$. $N+1=11$. $N+2=12$.
If $11$ is the neighbor $T$, then $12$ must be $UR$.

If $N=10$, its neighbors are 3, 4, 9, 2, 11, 12. (15 is not a neighbor of 10 based on standard hex layout).
Let's re-examine the diagram:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...

If 10 is adjacent to 4 and 3, and 9 and 2:
10 is N(3, 2). 4 is N(3, 1). 3 is N(2, 2).
9 is N(4, 1). 2 is N(3, 0).
This diagram representation is highly stylized. Assume standard hex adjacency for $N$ being the start of the next layer.

$S=2025$. $M=45$.
The neighbors of $N=2026$:

1. $N+1 = 2027$. (T or UR)
2. $N+2 = 2028$. (UR or T)
3. $S = 2025$. (DL)
4. $V_A$: The number located where $S$ was starting its final side segment (Down-Right axis, $A_{DR}$). This is $S - (M-1) = 2025 - 44 = 1981$. (Bottom-Left corner of $45 \times 45$ square).
If 2025 is the $DR$ corner, 1981 is the $BL$ corner.

Let's use the sequence of corners for $M=45$.
$1849$: Previous square.
$1850$: Start of Layer 23 (TR Corner).
$1893$: $A_{TR}$ axis point.
$1937$: $A_{TL}$ axis point.
$1981$: $A_{BL}$ axis point.
$2025$: $A_{DR}$ axis point.

$S=2025$ is at the end of the spiral path.
The neighbor positions of $N=2026$ relative to $S=2025$:

N is $U R$ relative to $S$.

$N=2026$ Neighbors:
1. $S = 2025$ (DL)

The remaining 5 neighbors must be points from the previous layer, or points from the current layer $(2027, 2028)$.

$S=2025$ is the last number on the path $L_{BR}$. The path moved towards $S$.
The number preceding $S$ is $S-1 = 2024$. $2024$ is adjacent to $S$.
$S=2025$ is the $DR$ vertex. $2024$ is $L$ of $S$.

$S$: $(x_s, y_s)$. $N$: $(x_s+1, y_s+1)$.

Neighbors of $S$:
$S-1 = 2024$.
$S-2 = 2023$.
$A_{DR} - M+1 = 1982$. (Start of the last side $L_{BR}$)
$A_{BL} = 1981$.

Let's assume the spiral configuration guarantees that $N=S+1$ has neighbors related symmetrically to $S$.

For $N=10$, $S=9$. $M=3$.
$N_{sum} = 9 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 11 + 12 = 41$.

$S=2025$. $N=2026$. $M=45$.

The general relationship for $N=S+1$:
1. $S$.
2. $N+1$.
3. $N+2$.

The three neighbors on the previous layer are defined by:
$V_L$: $S - (M+2)$.
$V_{UL}$: $S - (M+3)$.
$V_{DR}$: $S - (2M+1)$. (This assumes a $2M+1$ side length)
$V_{DR}$ corresponds to $S - 7$ for $M=3$. $2M+1 = 7$. Correct.

$V_{L}$: $S - 5$ for $M=3$. $M+2 = 5$. Correct.
$V_{UL}$: $S - 6$ for $M=3$. $M+3 = 6$. Correct.

We apply these generalized offsets where $M=45$:

1. $V_1 = S = 2025$. (DL)
2. $V_2 = N+1 = 2027$. (T)
3. $V_3 = N+2 = 2028$. (UR)

4. $V_L$: $S - (M+2) = 2025 - (45 + 2) = 2025 - 47 = 1978$. (Left)
5. $V_{UL}$: $S - (M+3) = 2025 - (45 + 3) = 2025 - 48 = 1977$. (Up-Left)
6. $V_{DR}$: $S - (2M+1) = 2025 - (2 \times 45 + 1) = 2025 - 91 = 1934$. (Down-Right)

We must ensure that $V_L, V_{UL}, V_{DR}$ are indeed the correct numbers surrounding $S$.

Let's check the positions of these calculated numbers relative to the corners of Layer 23 (ending at $S=2025$). $L=44$.

$A_{TR} = 1893$.
$A_{TL} = 1937$.
$A_{BL} = 1981$.
$A_{BR} = 2025$.

$V_{DR} = 1934$. This is $1937 - 3$. It is 3 steps away from the $A_{TL}$ corner, moving towards $A_{TR}$. This is definitely far away from $S=2025$.

Wait, the established pattern (4, 3, 2) is a result of specific turns of the spiral path. If $N$ is the start of a layer, it is located outside the square defined by $S$.

Let $S=9$. $M=3$.
$A_{BL}=7$. $A_{TL}=5$. $A_{TR}=3$.

$V_{DR}=2$. 2 is $A_{TR} - 1$.
$V_{UL}=3$. 3 is $A_{TR}$.
$V_L=4$. 4 is $A_{TL} - 1$.

If $M=45$. $A_{TR} = 1893$. $A_{TL} = 1937$.

Let's generalize the neighbors of $N=S+1$:
1. $S$
2. $N+1$
3. $N+2$
4. $A_{TR}$ (Top Right Corner of inner structure)
5. $A_{TR} - 1$ (This is $S - (2M+2)$? No. $A_{TR}-1 = 1892$.)
6. $A_{TL} - 1$ (Top Left Corner $-1$)

For $S=9$: $A_{TR}=3$. $A_{TL}=5$.
4. $A_{TR} = 3$. (UL)
5. $A_{TR}-1$: $3-1 = 2$. (DR). But this is $S-7$.
6. $A_{TL}-1$: $5-1 = 4$. (L). But this is $S-5$.

Let $M=45$.
1. $V_1 = S = 2025$.
2. $V_2 = N+1 = 2027$.
3. $V_3 = N+2 = 2028$.

4. $V_{UL}$: $A_{TR} = 1893$.
5. $V_{DR}$: $A_{TR} - 1 = 1892$.
6. $V_L$: $A_{TL} - 1 = 1937 - 1 = 1936$.

Let's verify these positions for $S=9, M=3$.
$A_{TR}=3$. $A_{TL}=5$.
1. $V_1 = 9$.
2. $V_2 = 11$.
3. $V_3 = 12$.
4. $V_{UL} = 3$. (Matches $N_3$ calculated before: $S-6$)
5. $V_{DR} = 3 - 1 = 2$. (Matches $N_2$ calculated before: $S-7$)
6. $V_L = 5 - 1 = 4$. (Matches $N_4$ calculated before: $S-5$)

The set of neighbors for $N=S+1$ is $\{S, S+2, S+3, A_{TR}, A_{TR}-1, A_{TL}-1\}$.
Wait, $N+1=11$, $N+2=12$.
For $S=9$: $\{9, 11, 12, 3, 2, 4\}$.
Sum $= 41$.

We must verify $N+2$ is a neighbor. In a standard hex grid, a point $(q, r)$ has neighbors $(q+1, r), (q, r+1), \dots$.
If $N$ is at $(x_N, y_N)$:
$S$ is at $(x_N-1, y_N-1)$.
$N+1$ is at $(x_N, y_N+1)$. (T)
$N+2$ is at $(x_N+1, y_N+1)$. (UR) -> This seems correct for the spiral path continuation.

Now we apply this to $N=2026$. $S=2025$. $M=45$.

$A_{TR}$: Top Right Corner of Layer 23.
$A_{TR} = (M-2)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.
No, $A_{TR}$ is $S_{k-1} + 44$.
$A_{TR} = 1849 + 44 = 1893$. (Checked earlier)
$A_{TL} = 1937$. (Checked earlier)

The 6 neighbors of $N=2026$ are:
1. $V_1 = S = 2025$
2. $V_2 = N+1 = 2027$
3. $V_3 = N+2 = 2028$
4. $V_4 = A_{TR} = 1893$
5. $V_5 = A_{TR} - 1 = 1892$
6. $V_6 = A_{TL} - 1 = 1936$

## 5. Calculate the Sum

Sum $R$:
$R = (2025 + 2027 + 2028) + (1893 + 1892 + 1936)$

$R_{high} = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 = 6080$.

$R_{low} = 1893 + 1892 + 1936$.
$1893 + 1892 = 3785$.
$R_{low} = 3785 + 1936 = 5721$.

Total Sum $R = 6080 + 5721 = 11801$.

## 6. Verification Check (Sum Symmetry)

In standard spiral problems, the sum of neighbors often follows a pattern related to $6N$ or $6S$.
If $N$ is the center of the neighbors, the sum is $6N$.
Here, $N=2026$. $6N = 6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Our calculated sum is $11801$. The difference is $12156 - 11801 = 355$.

Let's calculate the average of the neighbors: $11801 / 6 \approx 1966.8$. This is significantly lower than $N=2026$, which is expected since three neighbors are from the much smaller inner layer (Layer 23), and three are from the new layer.

Let's check the difference for $N=10$ ($S=9$).
Neighbors: $\{9, 11, 12, 3, 2, 4\}$. Sum = 41.
$6N = 60$. Difference = 19.

Check the general offset sum $O$ relative to $S$.
$S + (S+2) + (S+3) + (A_{TR}) + (A_{TR}-1) + (A_{TL}-1)$.
$S = M^2$. $M=2k-1$.
$A_{TR} = M^2 - 3(M-1)$.
$A_{TL} = M^2 - 2(M-1)$.

$S=9, M=3$.
$A_{TR} = 9 - 3(2) = 3$.
$A_{TL} = 9 - 2(2) = 5$.

Sum $= 3S + 5 + (A_{TR}) + (A_{TR}-1) + (A_{TL}-1)$
Sum $= 3(9) + 5 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 27 + 14 = 41$. Correct.

Now apply this general formula for $M=45, S=2025$:

$A_{TR} = 2025 - 3(44) = 2025 - 132 = 1893$.
$A_{TL} = 2025 - 2(44) = 2025 - 88 = 1937$.

Sum $R$:
$R = 3S + 5 + A_{TR} + (A_{TR} - 1) + (A_{TL} - 1)$
$R = 3(2025) + 5 + 1893 + 1892 + 1936$
$3(2025) = 6075$.
$R = 6075 + 5 + 1893 + 1892 + 1936$
$R = 6080 + 5721 = 11801$.

The result is consistent based on the derived pattern for $N=S+1$.
