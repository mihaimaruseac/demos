How to see it (sketch):

- In the hexagonal spiral, ring k consists of numbers from S_k = 3k^2 − 3k + 2 up to E_k = 3k^2 + 3k + 1.
- 2026 lies in ring k = 26 because S_26 = 1952 and E_26 = 2107. So 2026 is the 74th cell on ring 26 (t = 2026 − 1952 = 74).
- The ring is traversed starting at (k,0) and going along six directions in segments of length k. Since t = 74 lies on the third side (2k ≤ t ≤ 3k−1 for k = 26), the coordinate of 2026 is (-k, 3k − t) = (-26, 78 − 74) = (-26, 4).

The six neighbors have coordinates:
(-25,4), (-25,3), (-26,3), (-27,4), (-27,5), (-26,5).

Compute their values by locating them on their rings:

- (-25,4) and (-25,3) are on ring 25 (k = 25). For ring 25, S_25 = 1802 and t = 3k − y gives t = 75 − y:
  - (-25,4): t = 71 → value 1802 + 71 = 1873
  - (-25,3): t = 72 → value 1802 + 72 = 1874

- (-26,3) and (-26,5) are on ring 26. For ring 26, S_26 = 1952:
  - (-26,3): t = 3k − y = 78 − 3 = 75 → value 1952 + 75 = 2027
  - (-26,5): t = 78 − 5 = 73 → value 1952 + 73 = 2025

- (-27,4) and (-27,5) are on ring 27. For ring 27, S_27 = 2108:
  - (-27,4): t = 81 − 4 = 77 → value 2108 + 77 = 2185
  - (-27,5): t = 81 − 5 = 76 → value 2108 + 76 = 2184

Sum: 1873 + 1874 + 2027 + 2025 + 2185 + 2184 = 12168.
