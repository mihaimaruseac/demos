Reasoning (sketch):
- In the hexagonal spiral, ring k has numbers from a_k = 3k(k−1)+2 to b_k = 3k(k+1)+1.
- For N = 2026, find k with a_k ≤ N ≤ b_k. We get k = 26, since a_26 = 1952 and b_26 = 2107, with t = N − a_26 = 74.
- The coordinate of 2026 on ring 26 is on side 3 (the line q + r = −k) with
  q = −(t − 2k + 1) = −23, r = −k + (t − 2k + 1) = −3.
  So 2026 is at coordinates (−23, −3).

- The six neighbors are at:
  (−22, −3), (−22, −4), (−23, −4), (−24, −3), (−24, −2), (−23, −2).

- Compute their values by the ring formula. For a coordinate (q′, r′) with k′ = max(|q′|, |r′|, |q′+r′|), the value is
  N′ = a_{k′} + t′, where t′ depends on which side of ring k′ the coordinate lies. In these cases each neighbor lies on side 3 (q′ ≤ −1 and r′ = −k′ − q′), giving t′ = 2k′ − 1 − q′.

- The six values are:
  - (−22, −3) → 1873
  - (−22, −4) → 2025
  - (−23, −4) → 2184
  - (−24, −3) → 2185
  - (−24, −2) → 2027
  - (−23, −2) → 1874

- Sum = 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.
