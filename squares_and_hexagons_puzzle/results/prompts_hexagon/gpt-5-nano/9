Explanation (brief):

- Use the hexagonal spiral with axial coordinates. Let ring k have numbers from M(k-1)+1 to M(k), where M(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1).
- For N = 2026, find k: M(25) = 1951 < 2026 ≤ M(26) = 2107, so k = 26.
- Position of 2026 in ring 26: t = N − M(25) = 2026 − 1951 = 75. This lies on segment 3 (the SW-going edge) of the ring. The coordinate is
  x = −(t − (2k+1)) = −(75 − 53) = −22
  y = −k + (t − (2k+1)) = −26 + 22 = −4
  so 2026 is at (−22, −4).

- The six neighboring coordinates are obtained by adding the six axial directions:
  (−21, −4), (−21, −5), (−22, −5), (−23, −4), (−23, −3), (−22, −3).

- Map each neighbor (q, r) to its number N':
  determine its ring k' = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|), then locate its position t' along the ring (via the standard segment formulas) and N' = M(k'−1) + t'.

  The resulting neighbor values are:
  - (−21, −4) → 1873
  - (−21, −5) → 2025
  - (−22, −5) → 2184
  - (−23, −4) → 2185
  - (−23, −3) → 2027
  - (−22, −3) → 1874

- Sum: 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.
