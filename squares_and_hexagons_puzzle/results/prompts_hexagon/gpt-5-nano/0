Answer: 12168

Here's a clean way to see it using the hexagonal spiral structure.

- Rings: Ring k (k ≥ 1) has 6k cells with numbers from N0(k) = M(k-1)+1 to M(k) = 3k(k+1)+1, where M(k) = 3k(k+1)+1 and M(0)=1. For reference:
  - Ring 25: numbers 1802–1951
  - Ring 26: numbers 1952–2107
  - Ring 27: numbers 2108–2269

- Location of 2026:
  - 2026 lies in ring 26 since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107.
  - N0(26) = M(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952.
  - 2026 = 1952 + 74, so its ring-26 position has t = 74 along ring 26.

- Coordinates on ring 26 (using axial coordinates with starting cell (k,0) = (26,0) for t=0):
  - Side 1 (t = 0..25): (26, -t)
  - Side 2 (t = 26..51): (25 - (t - 26), -26)
  - Side 3 (t = 52..77): (-1 - (t - 52), -25 + (t - 52) + 1) = (-1 - u, -26 + 1 + u) with u = t - 52
  - Side 4 (t = 78..103): (-26, 1 + (t - 78))
  - Side 5 (t = 104..129): (-26 + 1 + (t - 104), 26)
  - Side 6 (t = 130..155): (t - 130, 26 - (t - 130))

  Using this, for t = 74 on ring 26 we get the coordinates of 2026:
  - t = 74 lies on side 3 with u = t - 52 = 22
  - coordinate(2026) = (-1 - 22, -26 + 1 + 22) = (-23, -3)

- The six neighbors of a cell at (q,r) are:
  (q+1,r), (q+1,r-1), (q,r-1), (q-1,r), (q-1,r+1), (q,r+1).
  For (q,r) = (-23,-3), the neighbors are:
  - A: (-22,-3)
  - B: (-22,-4)
  - C: (-23,-4)
  - D: (-24,-3)
  - E: (-24,-2)
  - F: (-23,-2)

- Find the value at each neighbor by locating its ring and t on that ring, then n = N0(k) + t.
  - A: (-22,-3) is ring 25. On ring 25, side 3 with k=25 gives t = 71. So n(A) = N0(25) + 71 = 1802 + 71 = 1873.
  - B: (-22,-4) is ring 26. On ring 26, side 3 with k=26 gives t = 73. So n(B) = 1952 + 73 = 2025.
  - C: (-23,-4) is ring 27. On ring 27, side 3 with k=27 gives t = 76. So n(C) = 2108 + 76 = 2184.
  - D: (-24,-3) is ring 27. On ring 27, side 3 with k=27 gives t = 77. So n(D) = 2108 + 77 = 2185.
  - E: (-24,-2) is ring 26. On ring 26, side 3 with k=26 gives t = 75. So n(E) = 1952 + 75 = 2027.
  - F: (-23,-2) is ring 25. On ring 25, side 3 with k=25 gives t = 72. So n(F) = 1802 + 72 = 1874.

- Sum of the six neighbors:
  1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.

Therefore, the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026 is 12168.
