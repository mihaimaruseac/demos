Reason (sketch):
- In this hex spiral, ring r has 6r numbers from min_r = 3r^2 - 3r + 2 up to max_r = min_r + 6r - 1.
- For n = 2026, solve 1 + 3r(r+1) ≥ 2026 to get r = 26. Then min_26 = 1952, so s = 2026 - 1952 = 74. This places 2026 on ring 26, on edge between corner 2 and corner 3.
- Using axial coordinates, 2026 corresponds to (q, r) = (-22, -4). Its six neighbors are:
  (-21,-4), (-21,-5), (-22,-5), (-23,-4), (-23,-3), (-22,-3).
- For a coordinate on ring d, the value is min_d + s, where s depends on which edge it lies on. Computing each neighbor’s value:
  - (-21,-4): 1873
  - (-21,-5): 2025
  - (-22,-5): 2184
  - (-23,-4): 2185
  - (-23,-3): 2027
  - (-22,-3): 1874
- Sum = 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12168.
