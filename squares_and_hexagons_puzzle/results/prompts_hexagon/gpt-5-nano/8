Explanation (sketch):
- The hex spiral rings satisfy M(r) = 1 + 3r(r+1), with ring r containing numbers from M(r-1)+1 to M(r). For n = 2026, M(25) = 1951 < 2026 ≤ M(26) = 2107, so 2026 lies on ring r = 26. The first number on this ring is N_start = M(25) + 1 = 1952, at coordinate (26, 0).
- The index along the ring is t = 2026 − 1952 = 74. Each ring has 6 sides of length r; t = 74 lies on side 3 (the SW side). With s = t − 2r = 74 − 52 = 22, the coordinate is (-1−s, −r+1+s) = (-23, −3).
- The six neighbors are at:
  (-22, -3), (-22, -4), (-23, -4), (-24, -3), (-24, -2), (-23, -2).
- Their values (by locating them on their respective rings) are:
  1873, 2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, 1874.
- Sum = 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 = 12,168.
