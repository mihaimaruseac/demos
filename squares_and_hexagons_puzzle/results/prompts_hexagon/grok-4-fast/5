## Explanation

The reasoning begins by determining the layer and position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral. The total numbers up to layer k is given by 1 + 3k(k+1). Solving for k where this exceeds 2026 yields k=26, as the total up to layer 25 is 1951, and layer 26 contains numbers 1952 to 2107. Thus, 2026 is the 75th number (m=75) in layer 26.

The coordinates in cube system (x, y, z) with x + y + z = 0 are computed as follows: the starting position for layer 26 is (1, 25, -26). After 25 steps in direction 1 [(1, -1, 0)], the position reaches (26, 0, -26) at m=26. The subsequent sides involve 26 steps each in directions 2 through 0. Since m=75 falls in the second side (direction 3: [-1, 0, 1]), starting from (26, -26, 0) at m=52, the 23rd step (q=23) gives coordinates (3, -26, 23) for 2026.

The six neighbors are found by adding the direction vectors to (3, -26, 23):
- + direction 0 [(1, 0, -1)]: (4, -26, 22), layer 26, m=74 → 2025
- + direction 1 [(1, -1, 0)]: (4, -27, 23), layer 27, m=77 → 2184
- + direction 2 [(0, -1, 1)]: (3, -27, 24), layer 27, m=78 → 2185
- + direction 3 [(-1, 0, 1)]: (2, -26, 24), layer 26, m=76 → 2027
- + direction 4 [(-1, 1, 0)]: (2, -25, 23), layer 25, m=73 → 1874
- + direction 5 [(0, 1, -1)]: (3, -25, 22), layer 25, m=72 → 1873

Each neighbor's layer l and m are determined similarly: for positions in the second side (y = -l), m = 2l + z. The numbers are then calculated as the total up to layer (l-1) plus m. Summing these yields 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
