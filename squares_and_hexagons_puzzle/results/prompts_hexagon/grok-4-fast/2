## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the layer of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, using the formula for the total numbers up to layer k: 3k(k+1) + 1. For k=25, this yields 1951, so 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26 (since 2026 - 1951 = 75).

The position of the first number in layer 26 (1952) is determined as (26, -25, -1) in cube coordinates, based on the pattern for the start of each layer. The layer's path consists of: 1 initial position, followed by 25 steps in direction 5 (northeast: (0,1,-1)), 26 steps in direction 4 (northwest: (-1,1,0)), and so on. Specifically, the 75th position falls on the direction 3 (west: (-1,0,1)) side, as the first 52 positions cover up to the end of direction 4. Thus, it is the 23rd step on this side, yielding coordinates (-23, 26, -3).

The six neighbors are obtained by adding the direction vectors to (-23, 26, -3):
- + (1,0,-1) → (-22, 26, -4), layer 26, 74th in layer → 2025
- + (1,-1,0) → (-22, 25, -3), layer 25, 72nd in layer → 1873
- + (0,-1,1) → (-23, 25, -2), layer 25, 73rd in layer → 1874
- + (-1,0,1) → (-24, 26, -2), layer 26, 76th in layer → 2027
- + (-1,1,0) → (-24, 27, -3), layer 27, 78th in layer → 2185
- + (0,1,-1) → (-23, 27, -4), layer 27, 77th in layer → 2184

Each neighbor's layer and index within the layer are found by matching coordinates to the side structures of their respective layers, using the base numbers up to the previous layer (e.g., up to layer 25: 1951; up to layer 26: 2107). The numbers are then: 2025 + 1873 + 1874 + 2027 + 2185 + 2184 = 12168.
