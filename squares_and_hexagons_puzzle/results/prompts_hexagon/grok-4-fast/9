## Explanation

The reasoning begins by determining the layer of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, where the total numbers up to layer n is given by 3n² + 3n + 1. Solving for n shows that 2026 lies in layer 26, as the cumulative up to layer 25 is 1951, and layer 26 contains numbers 1952 to 2107. Specifically, 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26.

The spiral path for layer n starts at the position obtained by adding the east vector (1, 0, -1) to the end of layer n-1, which is (n-1, -(n-1), 0), yielding (n, 1-n, -1) for n=26: (26, -25, -1). The path then proceeds with (n-1)=25 steps northeast (0, 1, -1), followed by n=26 steps each in northwest (-1, 1, 0), west (-1, 0, 1), southwest (0, -1, 1), southeast (1, -1, 0), and east (1, 0, -1) directions.

Tracing the path: the first position is the 1st in layer 26. After 25 northeast steps, the 26th position is reached. The next 26 northwest steps cover the 27th to 52nd positions. The west side then covers the 53rd to 78th positions. Since 75 is between 53 and 78, it is the 23rd step on the west side from the position after northwest, which is (0, 26, -26). Adding 23 west vectors gives the cube coordinates of 2026: (-23, 26, -3).

The six neighbors are found by adding the direction vectors to (-23, 26, -3):
- East: (-22, 26, -4), layer 26, 74th position, number 2025.
- Northeast: (-23, 27, -4), layer 27, 77th position, number 2184.
- Northwest: (-24, 27, -3), layer 27, 78th position, number 2185.
- West: (-24, 26, -2), layer 26, 76th position, number 2027.
- Southwest: (-23, 25, -2), layer 25, 73rd position, number 1874.
- Southeast: (-22, 25, -3), layer 25, 72nd position, number 1873.

Summing these numbers: 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
