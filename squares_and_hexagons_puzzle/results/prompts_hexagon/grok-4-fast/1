## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the layer of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral. The total numbers up to layer n is given by 1 + 3n(n+1). For n=25, this is 1951, and for n=26, it is 2107, confirming 2026 is in layer 26 at index 74 within that layer (2026 - 1951 - 1 = 74).

The spiral path for layer k starts at position (1, k-1) in axial coordinates. For k=26, this is (1, 25). The path proceeds as follows: 0 steps at start (index 0), then (k-1)=25 steps northeast (indices 1-25), 26 steps northwest (indices 26-51), 26 steps west (indices 52-77), and so on. Index 74 falls in the west segment (indices 52-77), where positions are (26 - m, -26) for m=1 to 26. Solving 26 - m = 3 gives m=23, so the position is (3, -26).

The six neighbors in axial coordinates are: east (4, -26), west (2, -26), northeast (4, -25), northwest (3, -25), southeast (3, -27), and southwest (2, -27).

To find the numbers at these positions, determine their layers using hex distance d = max(|q|, |r|, |q + r|): (4, -26) and (2, -26) in layer 26; (4, -25) and (3, -25) in layer 25; (3, -27) and (2, -27) in layer 27.

For each neighbor, compute its index within its layer using the path structure:

- For layer 26 (up to layer 25: 1951), west segment indices 52-77 at (26 - m, -26). For (4, -26), m=22, index=51+22=73, number=1951 + 74=2025. For (2, -26), m=24, index=75, number=1951 + 76=2027.

- For layer 25 (up to layer 24: 1801), west segment indices 50-74 at (25 - m, -25). For (4, -25), m=21, index=49+21=70, number=1801 + 71=1872. For (3, -25), m=22, index=71, number=1801 + 72=1873.

- For layer 27 (up to layer 26: 2107), west segment indices 54-80 at (27 - m, -27). For (3, -27), m=24, index=53+24=77, number=2107 + 78=2185. For (2, -27), m=25, index=78, number=2107 + 79=2186.

Sum the numbers: 2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2185 + 2186 = 12168.
