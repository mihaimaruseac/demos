## Explanation

The reasoning begins by determining the layer of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral, where the maximum number in layer k is given by 3k² + 3k + 1. Solving for k yields k=26, as the maximum for layer 25 is 1951 and for layer 26 is 2107. Thus, 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26, which has 156 numbers.

Layer 26 is divided into 6 sides of 26 numbers each. The 75th position falls on side 2 (positions 53 to 78), specifically the 23rd position on that side. Side 2 corresponds to movement westward along r = -26, with q decreasing from 25 to 0. For the 23rd position, the coordinates are (q=3, r=-26).

The six neighbors in the hexagonal grid are at:
- East: (4, -26)
- West: (2, -26)
- Southeast: (4, -27)
- Southwest: (3, -27)
- Northwest: (2, -25)
- Northeast: (3, -25)

Their layers are determined using the layer formula max(|q|, |r|, |q + r|):
- (4, -26) and (2, -26) are in layer 26.
- (3, -25) and (2, -25) are in layer 25.
- (4, -27) and (3, -27) are in layer 27.

For layer 26 (starting at 1952), (4, -26) is the 74th position (number 2025), and (2, -26) is the 76th (number 2027).

For layer 25 (starting at 1802), side 2 positions are calculated similarly: (3, -25) is the 72nd position (number 1873), and (2, -25) is the 73rd (number 1874).

For layer 27 (starting at 2108), (4, -27) is the 77th position (number 2184), and (3, -27) is the 78th (number 2185).

Summing these gives 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168.
