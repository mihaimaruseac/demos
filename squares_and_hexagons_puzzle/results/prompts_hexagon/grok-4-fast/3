## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the layer of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral. The largest number in layer n is given by 3n² + 3n + 1. Solving 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026 yields n = 26, as the total up to layer 25 is 1951, and layer 26 ranges from 1952 to 2107. Thus, 2026 is the 75th number (m = 75) in layer 26.

The position of the m-th number in layer n starts at (q, r) = (1, n-1) = (1, 25) for m = 1. The path proceeds as follows: (n-1) = 25 steps northeast (+1 q, -1 r), reaching (26, 0) at m = 26; then 26 steps north (0 q, -1 r), reaching (26, -26) at m = 52; then 26 steps west (-1 q, 0 r), where m = 75 corresponds to the 23rd west step from (26, -26), yielding (3, -26).

The six neighbors of (3, -26) are: (4, -26), (2, -26), (4, -27), (3, -27), (2, -25), and (3, -25). Their layers and positions are determined as follows:

- (4, -26): Layer 26, on the west side (r = -26, q = 4), m = 3×26 - 4 = 74, number = 1951 + 74 = 2025.
- (2, -26): Layer 26, west side, m = 78 - 2 = 76, number = 1951 + 76 = 2027.
- (4, -27): Layer 27, west side (r = -27, q = 4), m = 3×27 - 4 = 77, number = 2107 + 77 = 2184.
- (3, -27): Layer 27, west side, m = 81 - 3 = 78, number = 2107 + 78 = 2185.
- (2, -25): Layer 25, west side (r = -25, q = 2), m = 3×25 - 2 = 73, number = 1801 + 73 = 1874.
- (3, -25): Layer 25, west side, m = 75 - 3 = 72, number = 1801 + 72 = 1873.

Summing these numbers: 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
