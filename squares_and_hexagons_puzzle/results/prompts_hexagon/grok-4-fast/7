## Explanation

The reasoning begins by determining the layer and position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral. The total numbers up to layer n is given by 1 + 3n(n+1). Solving 1 + 3n(n+1) ≥ 2026 yields n=26, as the total up to layer 25 is 1951 and up to layer 26 is 2107. Thus, 2026 is the 75th number in layer 26.

The spiral path for layer n starts at coordinates (1, n-1, -n) in cube coordinates. For n=26, this is (1, 25, -26). The path consists of (n-1)=25 moves in direction 1 (northeast: +1, -1, 0), followed by n=26 moves each in directions 2 through 0 (northwest: +0, -1, +1; west: -1, +0, +1; southwest: -1, +1, +0; southeast: +0, +1, -1; east: +1, +0, -1).

After 25 northeast moves, the position is (26, 0, -26) at step 26 in the layer. After 26 northwest moves, it reaches (26, -26, 0) at step 52. The next segment is 26 west moves, where positions are (26 - j, -26, j) for j=1 to 26, with steps 53 to 78. For step 75, j=23, so the coordinates of 2026 are (3, -26, 23).

The six neighbors are obtained by adding the direction vectors:

- East: (4, -26, 22), layer 26, on y=-26 side, s=52 + 22=74, number=1951 + 74=2025
- Northeast: (4, -27, 23), layer 27, on y=-27 side, s=54 + 23=77, number=2107 + 77=2184
- Northwest: (3, -27, 24), layer 27, on y=-27 side, s=54 + 24=78, number=2107 + 78=2185
- West: (2, -26, 24), layer 26, on y=-26 side, s=52 + 24=76, number=1951 + 76=2027
- Southwest: (2, -25, 23), layer 25, on y=-25 side, s=50 + 23=73, number=1801 + 73=1874
- Southeast: (3, -25, 22), layer 25, on y=-25 side, s=50 + 22=72, number=1801 + 72=1873

Summing these numbers: 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
