To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of how numbers are laid out in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. The numbers start at the center and move outward in a spiral pattern. The key is to determine the position of the number 2026 and then find its six neighbors.

### Step 1: Determine the Ring Number

The numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal rings around the center. The center is considered ring 0. The first ring (ring 1) contains the numbers 2 to 7, the second ring (ring 2) contains the numbers 8 to 19, and so on.

For a given ring \( n \), the numbers range from \( 1 + 6 \times \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \) to \( 1 + 6 \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \).

The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Thus, the starting number of ring \( n \) is:

\[
1 + 6 \times \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1)
\]

The ending number of ring \( n \) is:

\[
1 + 6 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

We need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 3n(n-1) \leq 2026 \leq 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

Simplifying these inequalities:

1. \( 3n(n-1) \leq 2025 \)
2. \( 3n(n+1) \geq 2025 \)

Solving the first inequality:

\[
n(n-1) \leq 675
\]

Testing values for \( n \):

- \( n = 25 \): \( 25 \times 24 = 600 \) (satisfies the inequality)
- \( n = 26 \): \( 26 \times 25 = 650 \) (satisfies the inequality)
- \( n = 27 \): \( 27 \times 26 = 702 \) (does not satisfy)

Thus, \( n \leq 26 \).

Solving the second inequality:

\[
n(n+1) \geq 675
\]

Testing values for \( n \):

- \( n = 25 \): \( 25 \times 26 = 650 \) (does not satisfy)
- \( n = 26 \): \( 26 \times 27 = 702 \) (satisfies the inequality)

Thus, \( n \geq 26 \).

Therefore, \( n = 26 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Position of 2026

The starting number of ring 26 is:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]

The ending number of ring 26 is:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

The number 2026 is in ring 26. The position of 2026 in ring 26 is:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Neighbors

In a hexagonal grid, each number in ring \( n \) has 6 neighbors. The neighbors of a number at position \( k \) in ring \( n \) are:

- \( k-1 \) (previous in the same ring)
- \( k+1 \) (next in the same ring)
- The last number of ring \( n-1 \)
- The first number of ring \( n+1 \)
- Two additional numbers from the same ring or adjacent rings depending on the position

For position 75 in ring 26:

- The last number of ring 25 is 1950.
- The first number of ring 27 is 2108.

The numbers in ring 26 are laid out in a zigzag manner. For position 75, the neighbors are:

- \( 2026 - 1 = 2025 \)
- \( 2026 + 1 = 2027 \)
- Last number of ring 25: 1950
- First number of ring 27: 2108
- Two additional numbers from ring 26 or adjacent rings.

Since position 75 is not at a corner, it has two neighbors from ring 26:

- \( 2026 - 25 = 2001 \) (one backward from the start of ring 26)
- \( 2026 + 24 = 2050 \) (one forward from the start of ring 26)

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum

The neighbors are: 1950, 2001, 2025, 2027, 2050, 2108.

The sum is:

\[
1950 + 2001 + 2025 + 2027 + 2050 + 2108 = 12161
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{12161}\).
