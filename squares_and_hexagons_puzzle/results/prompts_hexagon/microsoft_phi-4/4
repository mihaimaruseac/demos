To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the spiral on the hexagonal grid. The spiral starts at the center with number 1 and spirals outward. Each hexagonal layer is formed by adding a ring of numbers around the previous layer.

### Step 1: Determine the Layer of 2026

The center of the spiral is 1. The numbers increase as we move outward in layers. Each layer \( n \) (starting from \( n = 1 \) for the center) forms a hexagon with side length \( n \).

- Layer 1 contains: \( 1 \)
- Layer 2 contains: \( 2 \) to \( 7 \)
- Layer 3 contains: \( 8 \) to \( 19 \)
- Layer 4 contains: \( 20 \) to \( 37 \)
- ...

The number of elements in layer \( n \) is \( 6(n-1) \). The total number of elements up to layer \( n \) is given by:

\[
1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 1 + 3(n-1)n
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 3(n-1)n \geq 2026
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
3(n-1)n \geq 2025
\]
\[
n(n-1) \geq 675
\]

Testing values for \( n \):

- \( n = 26 \): \( 26 \times 25 = 650 \) (not enough)
- \( n = 27 \): \( 27 \times 26 = 702 \) (sufficient)

Thus, 2026 is in layer 27.

### Step 2: Determine the Position of 2026

The first number in layer 27 is:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2101
\]

The numbers in layer 27 range from 2101 to:

\[
1 + 3 \times 27 \times 28 = 2268
\]

The position of 2026 within its layer is:

\[
2026 - 2101 + 1 = -74
\]

This indicates an error in calculation; let's correct it. We need to find the starting number of layer 26:

\[
1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1951
\]

The numbers in layer 26 range from 1951 to 2100. Thus, 2026 is in layer 27, and its position is:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Neighbors

The numbers in layer 27 form a hexagon with 54 positions. Starting from the bottom-left corner (position 1), the positions are numbered counterclockwise.

Position 75 in layer 27 corresponds to:

- Start at 2101 (bottom-left corner)
- Move 74 steps counterclockwise

The positions in layer 27 are:

- Bottom-left: 2101
- Bottom side: 2102 to 2117
- Right side: 2118 to 2133
- Top-right: 2134 to 2149
- Top side: 2150 to 2165
- Left side: 2166 to 2181

Position 75 is on the left side:

\[
2166 + 4 = 2170
\]

### Step 4: Find Neighbors

The neighbors of position 75 (2170) are:

- Left side, position 74: 2169
- Left side, position 76: 2171
- Top side, position 1: 2150
- Top side, position 6: 2155
- Top-right, position 1: 2134
- Right side, position 27: 2145

Summing these neighbors:

\[
2169 + 2171 + 2150 + 2155 + 2134 + 2145 = 12924
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{12153}\).
