To solve this problem, we need to first find the position of the number 2026 on the hexagonal spiral and then determine the sum of its 6 neighbors.

### Step 1: Identify the hexagonal layer containing 2026

Each hexagonal layer \( n \) contains numbers from \( 1 \) to \( 3n^2 \). The formula for the maximum number in the \( n \)-th layer is:

\[
3n^2
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
3n^2 \geq 2026
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n^2 \geq \frac{2026}{3} \approx 675.33
\]

\[
n \geq \sqrt{675.33} \approx 25.98
\]

Thus, \( n = 26 \).

### Step 2: Verify the range of numbers in layer 26

The maximum number in layer 26 is:

\[
3 \times 26^2 = 2028
\]

The minimum number in layer 26 is one more than the maximum number in layer 25:

\[
3 \times 25^2 + 1 = 1876
\]

Thus, numbers in layer 26 range from 1876 to 2028.

### Step 3: Determine the position of 2026 in layer 26

Layer 26 starts at 1876 and completes the hexagon by reaching 2028. The side length of layer 26 is 26, and it consists of 6 sides. We determine which side contains 2026 by calculating the numbers on each side:

- **First side**: Starts at 1876 and ends at \( 1876 + 25 = 1901 \).
- **Second side**: Starts at 1902 and ends at \( 1902 + 25 = 1927 \).
- **Third side**: Starts at 1928 and ends at \( 1928 + 25 = 1953 \).
- **Fourth side**: Starts at 1954 and ends at \( 1954 + 25 = 1979 \).
- **Fifth side**: Starts at 1980 and ends at \( 1980 + 25 = 2005 \).
- **Sixth side**: Starts at 2006 and ends at \( 2006 + 22 = 2028 \).

2026 is on the sixth side, starting at 2006. It is the \( 2026 - 2006 + 1 = 21 \)-st number on this side.

### Step 4: Locate 2026 on the hexagonal grid

The sixth side starts from the bottom right moving upwards. The positions on this side are:

- 2006 is at the bottom right.
- 2026 is 20 steps above 2006 on this side.

### Step 5: Calculate the neighbors of 2026

The neighbors of a number on the sixth side are:

- Directly left: \( 1980 + 25 = 2005 \)
- Directly right: \( 2006 + 21 - 1 = 2026 \) (the number itself)
- Above: \( 2006 + 26 = 2032 \) (but 2032 is outside the layer, so next is 2006 + 25 = 2031)
- Below: \( 2005 \)
- Diagonal left below: \( 1980 \)
- Diagonal right below: \( 1981 \)

Thus, the neighbors are: 2005, 2031, 2006, 1980, 1981.

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors

\[
2005 + 2031 + 2006 + 1980 + 1981 + 1979 = 11982
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{11982}
\]
