To solve this problem, we need to first identify the pattern in which the numbers are laid out in a hexagonal spiral. In this spiral, each number \( n \) is surrounded by six neighbors. We'll determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral and then find the sum of its six neighbors.

### Step 1: Identify the Layer

The numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal layers. The center number is 1, and each subsequent layer forms a hexagon around the previous layers.

- **Layer 0**: Contains only the number 1.
- **Layer 1**: Contains numbers from 2 to 7.
- **Layer 2**: Contains numbers from 8 to 19.
- **Layer 3**: Contains numbers from 20 to 37.
- - and so on.

The number of elements in each layer \( k \) (where \( k \geq 1 \)) is \( 6k \).

To find the layer containing 2026, we calculate the cumulative number of elements up to each layer until we reach or exceed 2026.

- **Layer 0**: 1 element (1)
- **Layer 1**: 1 + 6 = 7 elements
- **Layer 2**: 7 + 12 = 19 elements
- **Layer 3**: 19 + 18 = 37 elements
- **Layer 4**: 37 + 24 = 61 elements
- **Layer 5**: 61 + 30 = 91 elements
- **Layer 6**: 91 + 36 = 127 elements
- **Layer 7**: 127 + 42 = 169 elements
- **Layer 8**: 169 + 48 = 217 elements
- **Layer 9**: 217 + 54 = 271 elements
- **Layer 10**: 271 + 60 = 331 elements
- **Layer 11**: 331 + 66 = 397 elements
- **Layer 12**: 397 + 72 = 469 elements
- **Layer 13**: 469 + 78 = 547 elements
- **Layer 14**: 547 + 84 = 631 elements
- **Layer 15**: 631 + 90 = 721 elements
- **Layer 16**: 721 + 96 = 817 elements
- **Layer 17**: 817 + 102 = 919 elements
- **Layer 18**: 919 + 108 = 1027 elements
- **Layer 19**: 1027 + 114 = 1141 elements
- **Layer 20**: 1141 + 120 = 1261 elements
- **Layer 21**: 1261 + 126 = 1387 elements
- **Layer 22**: 1387 + 132 = 1519 elements
- **Layer 23**: 1519 + 138 = 1657 elements
- **Layer 24**: 1657 + 144 = 1801 elements
- **Layer 25**: 1801 + 150 = 1951 elements
- **Layer 26**: 1951 + 156 = 2107 elements

Since 2026 is between 1951 and 2107, it is in layer 26.

### Step 2: Determine the Position in the Layer

The first number in layer 26 is 1952, and the last number is 2107. The position of 2026 within this layer is:

\[
2026 - 1951 = 75
\]

This means 2026 is the 76th number in layer 26 (since we start counting from 0).

### Step 3: Calculate the Neighbors

Each side of the hexagon in layer \( k \) has \( k \) numbers. The numbers in layer 26 are arranged as follows:

- Start at position 0 (1952), move right to position 25 (1952 + 25 = 1977).
- Move down-right to position 50 (1977 + 25 = 2002).
- Move down-left to position 75 (2002 + 25 = 2027).
- Move left to position 100 (2027 - 25 = 2002).
- Move up-left to position 125 (2002 - 25 = 1977).
- Move up-right back to position 150 (1977 - 25 = 1952).

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- One less than 2026: 2025
- One more than 2026: 2027
- One position back in the layer (from position 75 to 50): 2002
- One position forward in the layer (from position 75 to 100): 2002 - 25 = 1977
- One position back in the layer (from position 50 to 25): 1977 - 25 = 1952
- One position forward in the layer (from position 25 to 0): 1952 - 25 = 1927

Thus, the neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2002, 1977, 1952, and 1927.

### Step 4: Sum the Neighbors

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2002 + 1977 + 1952 + 1927 = 11910
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{11910}\).
