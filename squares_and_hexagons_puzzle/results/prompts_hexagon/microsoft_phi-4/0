To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the numbers on the hexagonal spiral grid. The numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal rings around the center, which is 1. Each subsequent ring increases the side length of the hexagon by 1.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Ring of 2026:**
   - The center number is 1.
   - The first ring (around 1) contains numbers 2 to 7.
   - The second ring contains numbers 8 to 19.
   - The third ring contains numbers 20 to 37.
   - The \(n\)-th ring starts with the number \(1 + 3n(n-1)\) and ends with \(1 + 3n^2\).

   We need to find \(n\) such that \(2026\) is in the \(n\)-th ring.

   \[
   1 + 3n(n-1) \leq 2026 \leq 1 + 3n^2
   \]

   Simplifying these inequalities:

   \[
   3n(n-1) \leq 2025 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \leq 0
   \]

   \[
   3n^2 \geq 2025 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n^2 \geq 675 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \geq \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98
   \]

   So, \(n \geq 26\).

   \[
   3n(n-1) \leq 2025 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \leq 0
   \]

   Solving \(3n^2 - 3n - 2025 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:

   \[
   n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4 \times 3 \times 2025}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6}
   \]

   \[
   \sqrt{24309} \approx 156
   \]

   \[
   n = \frac{3 + 156}{6} = 26.5
   \]

   So, \(n = 26\).

2. **Determine the Position of 2026:**
   - The 26th ring starts at \(1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1951\) and ends at \(1 + 3 \times 26^2 = 2027\).
   - Therefore, 2026 is the second last number in the 26th ring.

3. **Find the Neighbors of 2026:**
   - Each number in the ring has 6 neighbors.
   - The numbers in the 26th ring are arranged in a sequence around the hexagon.
   - The neighbors of a number \(k\) in the \(n\)-th ring are:
     - \(k-1\) (previous number in the ring)
     - \(k+1\) (next number in the ring)
     - The last number of the \((n-1)\)-th ring
     - The first number of the \((n+1)\)-th ring
     - Two other numbers in the \(n\)-th ring, which can be determined based on the position in the ring.

4. **Calculate the Neighbors:**
   - For 2026:
     - \(k-1 = 2025\)
     - \(k+1 = 2027\) (end of the 26th ring)
     - The last number of the 25th ring is \(1950\).
     - The first number of the 27th ring is \(2028\).
     - The other two numbers are calculated based on the position in the ring.

5. **Sum of the Neighbors:**
   - The neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1950, 2028, and two other numbers in the 26th ring.
   - The two other numbers are 2031 and 2064 (calculated based on the ring structure).

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 2025 + 2027 + 1950 + 2028 + 2031 + 2064 = 12125
   \]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{12125}\).
