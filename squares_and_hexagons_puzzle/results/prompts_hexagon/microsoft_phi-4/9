To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of how numbers are laid out on a hexagonal spiral grid. The numbers increase as they spiral outwards from the center.

### Structure of the Spiral

1. **Hexagonal Layers**: The numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal layers around a central number. The first layer is just the number 1. The second layer surrounds 1, the third surrounds the second layer, and so on.

2. **Number of Elements in Each Layer**:
   - The first layer (center) has 1 element: \(1\).
   - The second layer has \(6\) elements.
   - The third layer has \(12\) elements.
   - The fourth layer has \(18\) elements.
   - Generally, the \(n\)-th layer has \(6(n-1)\) elements.

3. **Total Numbers Up to a Layer**:
   - Total numbers up to the first layer: \(1\).
   - Total numbers up to the second layer: \(1 + 6 = 7\).
   - Total numbers up to the third layer: \(7 + 12 = 19\).
   - Total numbers up to the fourth layer: \(19 + 18 = 37\).
   - Generally, the total number of elements up to the \(n\)-th layer is \(1 + 6(1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1)) = 1 + 3(n-1)n\).

### Finding the Layer of 2026

We need to find the layer in which 2026 is located. We solve for \(n\) in the inequality:

\[
1 + 3(n-1)n \leq 2026 < 1 + 3n(n-1) + 6n
\]

Simplifying the inequality:

\[
3(n-1)n \leq 2025
\]

\[
3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \leq 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(3n^2 - 3n - 2025 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 24300}}{6}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6}
\]

Approximating \(\sqrt{24309} \approx 155.9\):

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 155.9}{6}
\]

The positive solution is:

\[
n \approx \frac{158.9}{6} \approx 26.48
\]

Thus, \(n = 26\) is the largest integer satisfying the inequality. We check:

- Total numbers up to the 25th layer: \(1 + 3 \times 25 \times 24 = 1 + 1800 = 1801\).
- Total numbers up to the 26th layer: \(1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951\).

Since \(1801 < 2026 \leq 1951\), 2026 is in the 26th layer.

### Position in the 26th Layer

The 26th layer starts at 1802 and ends at 1951. The position of 2026 in this layer is:

\[
2026 - 1801 = 225
\]

### Neighbors in the Hexagonal Spiral

In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number in the \(n\)-th layer, the neighbors are determined by their positions relative to the start of the layer.

- **First Position**: 1802
- **Last Position**: 1951

The 26th layer has 6 sides, each with 26 numbers. The sides are indexed from 0 to 5.

- **Side Length**: 26
- **Position in Side**: \((225 - 1) \mod 26 = 224 \mod 26 = 16\)

The position 225 corresponds to the 17th number on the 3rd side (0-indexed).

### Neighbors Calculation

The neighbors are:
- The previous number on the same side: \(225 - 1 = 224\)
- The next number on the same side: \(225 + 1 = 226\) (if not last in the side)
- The start of the previous side: \(225 - 16 - 1 = 208\)
- The start of the next side: \(225 + (26 - 16) = 235\)
- The end of the previous side: \(208 + 26 - 1 = 233\)
- The start of the first side: \(1802\)

Calculating the specific numbers:
- **224**: On the 3rd side, 16th position, number is \(1801 + 16 = 1817\).
- **226**: On the 3rd side, 18th position, number is \(1801 + 18 = 1819\).
- **208**: On the 2nd side, 17th position, number is \(1801 + 26 + 16 = 1843\).
- **235**: On the 4th side, 9th position, number is \(1801 + 2 \times 26 + 9 = 1862\).
- **233**: On the 3rd side, 26th position, number is \(1801 + 2 \times 26 = 1853\).
- **1802**: Start of the 26th layer.

### Sum of Neighbors

The sum of the neighbors is:

\[
1817 + 1819 + 1843 + 1862 + 1853 + 1802 = 11096
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{11096}\).
