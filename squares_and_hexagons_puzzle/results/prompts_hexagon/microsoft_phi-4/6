To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of how numbers are placed on a hexagonal spiral grid. The grid is structured such that each layer forms a hexagon around the central number 1. 

### Understanding the Spiral Structure

1. **Layer Structure:**
   - The center is the number 1.
   - The first layer around 1 contains numbers 2 to 7.
   - The second layer contains numbers 8 to 19.
   - The third layer contains numbers 20 to 37.
   - Generally, the \( n \)-th layer contains numbers from \( 1 + 3n(n-1) \) to \( 1 + 3n^2 \).

2. **Number of Elements in Each Layer:**
   - The \( n \)-th layer has \( 6n \) elements.

### Finding the Layer of 2026

To determine which layer contains the number 2026, we need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 3n(n-1) \leq 2026 \leq 1 + 3n^2
\]

Simplifying these inequalities:

- \( 3n(n-1) \leq 2025 \)
- \( 3n^2 \geq 2025 \)

**Solving \( 3n^2 \geq 2025 \):**

\[
n^2 \geq \frac{2025}{3} = 675 \implies n \geq \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98
\]

Thus, \( n \geq 26 \).

**Solving \( 3n(n-1) \leq 2025 \):**

\[
3n^2 - 3n \leq 2025 \implies n^2 - n \leq 675
\]

Solving \( n^2 - n - 675 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97 \):

\[
n \approx \frac{1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 26.485
\]

Thus, \( n \leq 26 \).

Combining both, \( n = 26 \).

### Position of 2026 in the 26th Layer

The 26th layer contains numbers from:

\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1951 \quad \text{to} \quad 1 + 3 \times 26^2 = 2027
\]

2026 is the second last number in this layer.

### Determine the Neighbors of 2026

In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number at position \( k \) in the \( n \)-th layer, the neighbors are:

- \( k-1 \) (previous number in the same layer)
- \( k+1 \) (next number in the same layer)
- The last number of the \((n-1)\)-th layer
- The first number of the \((n+1)\)-th layer
- The number before the start of the \((n-1)\)-th layer
- The number after the end of the \((n+1)\)-th layer

**Neighbors of 2026:**

- \( 2025 \) (previous number)
- \( 2027 \) (next number, but it is the start of the next layer)
- \( 1974 \) (last number of the 25th layer)
- \( 2801 \) (first number of the 27th layer)
- \( 1975 \) (number before the start of the 25th layer)
- \( 2800 \) (number after the end of the 27th layer)

### Sum of the Neighbors

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1974 + 2801 + 1975 + 2800 = 13602
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{13602}\).
