To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of numbers on the hexagonal spiral grid. The numbers increase in a spiral pattern starting from the center. The grid is structured such that each layer forms a hexagon around the previous layers.

### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Identify the Layer of 2026:**
   - The numbers in the spiral are organized in layers. The first layer contains only the number 1.
   - The second layer contains numbers from 2 to 7.
   - The third layer contains numbers from 8 to 19.
   - In general, the \( n \)-th layer contains numbers from \( 1 + 3(n-1)n \) to \( 1 + 3n(n+1) \).

   We need to find the layer \( n \) such that:
   \[
   1 + 3(n-1)n < 2026 \leq 1 + 3n(n+1)
   \]

   Simplifying the inequalities:
   \[
   3(n-1)n < 2025
   \]
   \[
   3n(n+1) \geq 2025
   \]

   Solving \( 3n^2 \approx 2025 \) gives:
   \[
   n^2 \approx \frac{2025}{3} = 675
   \]
   \[
   n \approx \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98
   \]

   Testing \( n = 25 \) and \( n = 26 \):
   - For \( n = 25 \):
     \[
     3 \times 24 \times 25 = 1800
     \]
     \[
     3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1950
     \]
     So, \( 1801 \) to \( 1950 \) is the range for \( n = 25 \).

   - For \( n = 26 \):
     \[
     3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1950
     \]
     \[
     3 \times 26 \times 27 = 2106
     \]
     So, \( 1951 \) to \( 2106 \) is the range for \( n = 26 \).

   Since \( 2026 \) is between \( 1951 \) and \( 2106 \), it is in the 26th layer.

2. **Determine the Position of 2026 in the 26th Layer:**
   - The numbers in the 26th layer start at 1951 and end at 2106.
   - The position of 2026 within this layer is:
     \[
     2026 - 1951 = 75
     \]

   The 26th layer has 6 sides, each with 26 numbers (since \( n = 26 \)). The sequence of numbers in the layer is structured as follows:
   - Side 1: 1951 to 1976
   - Side 2: 1977 to 2002
   - Side 3: 2003 to 2028
   - Side 4: 2029 to 2054
   - Side 5: 2055 to 2080
   - Side 6: 2081 to 2106

   Since 2026 is the 74th number in the third side (2003 to 2028), it is the 24th number on this side.

3. **Find the Neighbors of 2026:**
   - The neighbors of a number in a hexagonal grid are the numbers immediately preceding and succeeding it on the same side, and the numbers at the corners of the current and previous sides.

   For 2026, the neighbors are:
   - On the same side (Side 3): 2025 and 2027
   - Corner of Side 2: 2002 (end of Side 2)
   - Corner of Side 3: 2028 (start of Side 4)
   - Corner of Side 4: 2029 (start of Side 4)
   - Corner of Side 1 of the previous layer (Layer 25): 1950

   Therefore, the neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2002, 2028, 2029, and 1950.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Neighbors:**
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2002 + 2028 + 2029 + 1950 = 12061
   \]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{12061}\).
