To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of numbers on the hexagonal spiral and determine the position of the number 2026. Then, we will identify its six neighbors and calculate their sum.

### Hexagonal Spiral Layout

The hexagonal spiral is constructed layer by layer. The center of the spiral is 1, and each subsequent layer surrounds the previous one. The layers are numbered starting from 0.

- **Layer 0**: Contains only the number 1.
- **Layer 1**: Contains numbers from 2 to 7.
- **Layer 2**: Contains numbers from 8 to 19.
- **Layer 3**: Contains numbers from 20 to 37.
- And so on.

The number of elements in each layer \( n \) (where \( n \geq 1 \)) is \( 6n \).

### Finding the Layer of 2026

To find the layer containing 2026, we need to determine the range of numbers in each layer:

- **Layer 0**: 1 element (1)
- **Layer 1**: 6 elements (2 to 7)
- **Layer 2**: 12 elements (8 to 19)
- **Layer 3**: 18 elements (20 to 37)
- **Layer n**: \( 6n \) elements

The total number of elements up to layer \( n \) is given by the formula:

\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + \cdots + n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 3n(n+1) \geq 2026
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
3n(n+1) \geq 2025
\]

\[
n(n+1) \geq 675
\]

Approximating \( n^2 \approx 675 \), we find \( n \approx \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98 \). Testing \( n = 25 \) and \( n = 26 \):

- For \( n = 25 \):
  \[
  25 \times 26 = 650 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1951
  \]
- For \( n = 26 \):
  \[
  26 \times 27 = 702 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + 3 \times 702 = 2107
  \]

Thus, 2026 is in layer 26.

### Position of 2026 in Layer 26

The first number in layer 26 is 1952 (since 1951 is the total number of elements up to layer 25). The numbers in layer 26 range from 1952 to 2107.

The position of 2026 within layer 26 is:

\[
2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

### Neighbors of 2026

In layer \( n \), the numbers are arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The six directions (sides of the hexagon) are:

1. Right
2. Top-right
3. Top-left
4. Left
5. Bottom-left
6. Bottom-right

The starting point for layer 26 is 1952, and numbers increase in a clockwise direction:

- Right: 1953 to 1958
- Top-right: 1959 to 1965
- Top-left: 1966 to 1972
- Left: 1973 to 1979
- Bottom-left: 1980 to 1986
- Bottom-right: 1987 to 1952 (completes the loop)

The position 74 corresponds to:

- Right: 1953 to 1958 (6 numbers)
- Top-right: 1959 to 1965 (7 numbers)
- Top-left: 1966 to 1972 (7 numbers)
- Left: 1973 to 1979 (7 numbers)
- Bottom-left: 1980 to 1986 (7 numbers)
- Bottom-right: 1987 to 1952 (7 numbers)

Position 74 falls in the "Bottom-left" segment (position 6 in this segment):

- Bottom-left: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986

Thus, 2026 is the 6th number in this segment, so it is 1985.

The neighbors of 1985 are:

- 1984 (previous in the segment)
- 1986 (next in the segment)
- 1987 (start of the next loop)
- 1974 (left side, 7 steps back)
- 1973 (left side, 6 steps back)
- 1967 (top-left side, 7 steps back)

Calculating these:

- 1984
- 1986
- 1987
- 1974
- 1973
- 1967

### Sum of Neighbors

\[
1984 + 1986 + 1987 + 1974 + 1973 + 1967 = 11871
\]

Thus, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{11871}\).
