Let $n$ be the number on the hexagonal grid. We want to find the six neighbors of the number 2026. The given arrangement of the natural numbers is a hexagonal spiral. We can represent the position of the number $n$ as $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates on the hexagonal grid.

We can analyze the spiral pattern. The numbers are written in a clockwise spiral. The numbers in the first layer are 1. The numbers in the second layer are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The numbers in the third layer are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

The number of elements in each layer is $6k$ for $k \ge 1$, where $k$ is the layer number.
The total number of elements up to layer $k$ is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k^2 + 3k + 1$.
Let $k$ be the layer number where 2026 is located. We have $3k^2 + 3k + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3k^2 + 3k - 2025 \ge 0$
$k^2 + k - 675 \ge 0$
We can solve for $k$ using the quadratic formula: $k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}$.
We take the positive root: $k \approx \frac{-1 + 52}{2} = \frac{51}{2} = 25.5$. So $k \approx 25$.
If $k=25$, then $3(25^2) + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
If $k=26$, then $3(26^2) + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2028$.
Thus, 2026 is in the 26th layer.

The first number in layer $k$ is $3(k-1)^2 + 3(k-1) + 2 = 3k^2 - 3k + 2$.
The first number in the 26th layer is $3(25^2) + 3(25) + 2 = 1875 + 75 + 2 = 1952$.
The numbers in the 26th layer are $1952, 1953, ..., 2027$.
The number 2026 is $2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75$th number in the 26th layer.
Since the 26th layer has $6(25) = 150$ numbers, 2026 is in the 26th layer.
Let's find the neighbors of 2026.
The number of elements in the 26th layer is $6 \cdot 25 = 150$.
Let's analyze the number of elements in each "arm" of the hexagon.
There are six arms.
The $i$-th arm starts at $3(k-1)^2+3(k-1)+2$.
In layer $k$, there are 6 arms, and each arm has $k$ numbers.
In layer 26, the numbers in the layer are from 1952 to 2027.
Since $2026$ is $75$th in layer 26, the neighbors are $2025, 2027$ and the neighbors of the neighbors.
Since 75 is the 12th position of the 6th side of the hexagon.
Let's find the neighbors:
$2026 - 1 = 2025$
$2026 + 1 = 2027$
The neighbors are $2025, 2027$.
$2026 - 25 = 2001$
$2026 - 26 = 2000$
$2026 + 26 = 2052$
$2026 + 25 = 2051$
The neighbors are: $2025, 2027, 2000, 2001, 2051, 2052$.
The sum is $2025+2027+2000+2001+2051+2052 = 12156$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
