Let $N$ be the number at a given position in the hexagonal grid. We can describe the positions of the numbers in the hexagonal grid by a spiral. The number 1 is in the center. The numbers are written in a spiral pattern around the center.
Let $n(r)$ be the largest number in the spiral layer $r$, where $r=0$ is the center layer containing only 1. The next layer $r=1$ contains numbers 2 to 7. The next layer $r=2$ contains numbers 8 to 19. The next layer $r=3$ contains numbers 20 to 37.
In general, $n(r) = 3r(r+1) + 1$.
To find the layer of 2026, we have $3r(r+1) + 1 \ge 2026$, so $3r(r+1) \ge 2025$, or $r(r+1) \ge 675$. Since $25 \times 26 = 650$ and $26 \times 27 = 702$, we know that $r=26$.
Thus, $n(25) = 3(25)(26) + 1 = 1951$.
So 2026 is in the 26th layer.
We know that the maximum number in layer 26 is $n(26) = 3(26)(27) + 1 = 2107$.
We are given that $n(r) = 3r(r+1) + 1$.
The numbers around 2026 are in the layer 26.
The numbers surrounding 2026 will be in layer 25 or 26.
Let the neighbors of 2026 be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$.
We know that 2026 is in the 26th layer. The numbers in the 26th layer range from 1952 to 2107.
Let's analyze the positions.
When we have number 1, its neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Sum of neighbors = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27.
The number 2026 is in layer 26.
The number 2026 is close to the end of the layer, since 2026 is greater than $1951 = 3(25)(26)+1$.
Since 2026 is in layer 26, the numbers around it will be in layers 25 and 26.
We can express the neighbors of 2026 as $x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5$, or $y, y-1, y-2, y-3, y-4, y-5$.
In this case, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is:
The numbers in layer 25 are 1952 to 2107.
The numbers surrounding 2026 are:
$a_1 = 2025$, $a_2 = 2027$, $a_3 = 2025-15 = 2010$, $a_4 = 2027+15 = 2042$,
$a_5 = 2025-14 = 2011$, $a_6 = 2027+14 = 2041$
Neighbors are $2025, 2027, 2010, 2042, 2011, 2041$ (approx.)
The neighbors of a number $N$ are close to $N-1$ and $N+1$, and we also have neighbors in the layers before and after.
The neighbors are approximately $N \pm 1$ and $N \pm r$.
Sum = $2026-1+2026+1+2010+2042+2011+2041 = 12150$.
$2026-r$, $2026-r+1$, $2026-1$, $2026+1$, $2026+r-1$, $2026+r$.
The values of the neighbors of 2026 are approximately 2025, 2027, 2010, 2042, 2011, 2041. Sum = 12156.
Sum of neighbors is $2025+2027+2010+2042+2011+2041 = 12166$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
