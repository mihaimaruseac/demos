Let's analyze the hexagonal spiral. We can see that the numbers are arranged in concentric hexagons around the central number 1. The numbers are increasing as we move away from the center.

We can analyze the layers of the spiral:
- Layer 1: 1
- Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 3: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
- Layer 4: 20, ..., 37 (18 numbers)
...

The number of elements in each layer (excluding the center) is $6(n-1)$, where $n$ is the layer number.
The total number of elements up to layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{k=2}^n 6(k-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 1 + 6 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1)$.

We want to find the layer of 2026.
$1 + 3n(n-1) \approx 2026$
$3n(n-1) \approx 2025$
$n(n-1) \approx 675$
Since $26 \times 25 = 650$ and $27 \times 26 = 702$, we can guess that $n \approx 26$.
Let's find the total number of elements up to layer 26: $1 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
Let's find the total number of elements up to layer 27: $1 + 3 \times 27 \times 26 = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 < 2107$, 2026 is in layer 27.

The numbers in layer 27 are from $1 + 3(26)(25) + 1 = 1952$ to $1 + 3(27)(26) = 2107$.
So we know that 2026 is in layer 27.
We have $2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The numbers in layer 27 range from 1952 to 2107. The difference between the highest and lowest numbers in this layer is $1951 - 1 = 1950$, and the numbers increase in layers of 6.
There are $6(27-1) = 156$ numbers in layer 27.
The number 2026 is the 75th number in layer 27.
Let's consider the number of elements in layer $n$: $6(n-1)$.
The elements in the layer are roughly ordered in 6 directions from the center.
In layer 27, the numbers are from 1952 to 2107.
Let's find the coordinates of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let the center be 1. The vertices are 2, 8, 20, 38, 62, 92, ...
The center of layer 27 would be $1+3(26)(25)=1951+1=1952$.
We need to determine the positions of the 6 neighbors of 2026.
The sum of the neighbors is $2025+2027+2028+2027+2021+2020=12148$.

The formula for the sum of the neighbors is $6x$.

Let's find the neighbors of 2026.
The neighbors will be approximately around the same layer.
The neighbors are approximately $2026 - 1, 2026 + 1, 2026 + d_1, 2026 + d_2, 2026 - d_1, 2026 - d_2$.

The neighbors of 2026 are approximately at distances of 1.
The numbers 2025, 2027 are neighbors.
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $2025+2027+\dots = 12156$

Sum = 12156
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
