Let $n$ be the number at a position $(r, c)$ in the hexagonal grid. We can describe the numbers in the spiral as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 is at the center
    \item The numbers spiral outwards in a counterclockwise direction.
    \item The numbers in the spiral are in a hexagonal pattern.
\end{itemize}

We can describe the layers around the center 1. The first layer consists of 6 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The second layer consists of 12 numbers (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). The third layer has 18 numbers, and so on.
In general, the $k$th layer has $6k$ numbers.
The number of elements up to the $k$th layer is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)$.
We want to find the layer number for 2026.
$1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026$
$3k(k+1) \geq 2025$
$k(k+1) \geq 675$
We can estimate $k$ by $\sqrt{675} \approx 25.98$.
Let's try $k=25$. Then $25(26) = 650$. The total number of elements up to layer 25 is $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
Let's try $k=26$. Then $26(27) = 702$. The total number of elements up to layer 26 is $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
So the number 2026 is in the 26th layer.
The starting number of layer 26 is $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1951$.
Since 2026 is in the 26th layer, $2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The numbers in the 26th layer start at 1952.
The numbers in layer $k$ are from $1 + 3(k-1)k + 1$ to $1 + 3k(k+1)$.
The number 1952 is at the position of $1952 - 1951 = 1$. The $k$th layer has $6k$ numbers, so the 26th layer has $6(26) = 156$ numbers.
Let's consider the six neighbors.
The numbers in the 26th layer are from 1952 to 2107.
The number 2026 is in the 26th layer. The numbers in the spiral are in increasing order.
The numbers around 2026 are likely to be around 2026.
Let $n_1, \dots, n_6$ be the neighbors.
We can approximate the neighbors by their position in the spiral.
We know that the average value of the neighbors is close to 2026.
The total number of elements in the layer is $6k = 156$.
Consider the average value of the numbers in layer $k$: $\frac{1+3(k-1)k + 1 + 1+3k(k+1)}{2} = \frac{1 + 1 + 3k^2 - 3k + 3k^2 + 3k}{2} = \frac{2 + 6k^2}{2} = 1 + 3k^2$.
So, for $k=26$, $1 + 3(26^2) = 1 + 3(676) = 1 + 2028 = 2029$.
The average value of the layer is 2029.
We know that the sum of the numbers in the $k$th layer is $(1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 + 1 + 3k(k+1)) \frac{6k}{2}$.
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is approximately $6 \times 2029 = 12174$.
The numbers around 2026 are close to 2029.
$2026 - 1951 = 75$. We want to find the number of neighbors.
If 2026 is in the 26th layer, then it has neighbors in the 25th layer and the 26th layer.
The 25th layer has $3(25)(26) = 1950$. $n=2026$.
Let's look at the neighbors of 1. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Sum is 27.
The neighbors of 2 are 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10. Sum is 38.
If we let 2026 be close to the middle of the layer, the numbers are roughly equidistant. The sum of the neighbors is approximately $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
