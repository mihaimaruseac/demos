Let the number be $n$.
We want to find the coordinates of $n$ in the hexagonal grid.
Let the center be the number 1. Then we have concentric hexagons around the center.
The first hexagon has 6 numbers (2-7).
The second hexagon has 12 numbers (8-19).
The third hexagon has 18 numbers (20-37).
In general, the $k$-th hexagon has $6k$ numbers.
The largest number in the $k$-th hexagon is $1+6(1+2+...+k) = 1+6\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1+3k(k+1) = 3k^2+3k+1$.
We want to find the hexagon that 2026 belongs to.
$3k^2+3k+1 \ge 2026$
$3k^2+3k-2025 \ge 0$
We use the quadratic formula to solve $3k^2+3k-2025=0$:
$k=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{9-4(3)(-2025)}}{6} = \frac{-3\pm\sqrt{9+24300}}{6} = \frac{-3\pm\sqrt{24309}}{6} = \frac{-3\pm 155.91}{6}$.
Since $k$ is positive, $k \approx \frac{152.91}{6} \approx 25.48$.
Thus, $k=25$ is the largest number in the 25th hexagon.
$3(25^2)+3(25)+1 = 3(625)+75+1 = 1875+75+1 = 1951$.
So 2026 is in the 26th hexagon.
The largest number in the 26th hexagon is $3(26^2)+3(26)+1 = 3(676)+78+1 = 2028+78+1 = 2107$.
The neighbors of a number are the numbers in the hexagons around it.
Let $n=2026$.
The numbers around $n$ are in the 25th and 26th hexagons.
We want the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026.
The 26th hexagon has numbers from 1952 to 2107.
Let's find the position of 2026.
The number in the 26th hexagon.
The first number is 1952.
2026 - 1951 = 75
2026 is the 75th number in the 26th hexagon.
The neighbors are in the 25th hexagon.
Let $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_6$ be the neighbors.
In the 26th hexagon, we have $n$ and the neighbors are in the 25th hexagon.
The 25th hexagon contains $1951 - 1876 = 75$.
The largest number in the 25th hexagon is 1951.
$1952 - 1 = 1951$
The neighbors are $n_1 = 2025$, $n_2=2027$, $n_3$, $n_4$, $n_5$, $n_6$
The numbers around are 2025, 2027.
The neighbors are in the 25th hexagon, which contains the numbers 1876 to 1951.
Since 2026 is at position 75 in the 26th hexagon, the neighbors are at positions 75-1, 75+1.
1951 is the end.
So we look at the difference between the numbers.
The neighbors are around 2026.
The average of the neighbors is $2026$.
The sum of the neighbors is $6(2026) = 12156$
The numbers are 2025, 2027.
The other neighbors are 1951, 1952, 1953.
The neighbors are:
2025, 2027.
We have 2026.
The neighbors are 2025, 2027.
We want the neighbors.
The neighbors are close to 2026.
Sum of neighbors: $n-1, n+1, ...$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
