Let the number $n$ be located at $(x, y)$ in the hexagonal grid. We want to find the six neighbors of 2026. The neighbors of a number are the numbers that are adjacent to it in the grid.
We can think of the spiral as a sequence of concentric hexagons. The center is 1.
The numbers in the $k$-th layer are located in a hexagon with $6(k-1)$ sides. The number of cells in the $k$-th layer is $6k$.
The numbers around the center are $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, so the neighbors of 1 are $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, and their sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27$.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern. We can see that the sequence is formed by moving around the center.
The numbers in each layer grow in a clockwise manner.
Let's find the layer of 2026. The $k$-th layer contains $6k$ numbers. The number of cells in the first $k$ layers is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1)$.
We want to find $k$ such that $1 + 3k(k-1) \approx 2026$.
$3k^2 - 3k + 1 \le 2026$
$3k^2 - 3k - 2025 \approx 0$
Using the quadratic formula, $k = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4(3)(-2025)}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9+24300}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6} \approx \frac{3 \pm 155.91}{6}$.
Thus, $k \approx \frac{158.91}{6} \approx 26.48$. So $k$ is likely to be 26 or 27.
The number of elements up to layer $k$ is $1 + 3k(k-1)$.
For $k=26$: $1 + 3(26)(25) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
For $k=27$: $1 + 3(27)(26) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
So, 2026 is in the 27th layer.
We have $1951$.
The numbers in layer 27 range from $1952$ to $2107$.
So 2026 is in the 27th layer.
The neighbors are approximately around $2026$. The number of cells is 2107.
Let $n_1, \dots, n_6$ be the neighbors of 2026.
We can say that $n_1 = 2025$, $n_2 = 2027$.
The positions of the neighbors are relatively close to the position of 2026.
Let's find the six neighbors of 2026. Since the neighbors are close to 2026, the positions are likely to be around 2026.
We can estimate the neighbors as $2025, 2027, 2083, 1969, 2084, 1970$.
Their sum is $2025+2027+2083+1969+2084+1970 = 12158$.
The sum of neighbors of $n$ is approximately $6n$.
So, $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.
Consider the average of the neighbors: $12158/6 \approx 2026.33$.
The neighbors are $2025, 2027, x, y, z, w$.
The sum of the neighbors is $12158$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
