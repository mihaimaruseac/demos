Let the hexagonal spiral start at 1. The neighbors of a number $n$ are the six numbers surrounding it.
We want to find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026.
The number 1 is in the center. The numbers in the first layer are 2-7, the second layer are 8-19, and so on.
The number of elements in each layer is $6k$, where $k=1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
The numbers at the corners of the hexagon are $3k^2 - 3k + 2$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \ldots$ and $3k^2 - 3k + 1$.
The numbers on the second hexagon are 8, 14, 19, 23, 26, 28.
We want to find the neighbors of 2026.
Consider the hexagon that surrounds 2026. The formula for the corners of the hexagon is given by $3k^2-3k+1$.
We want to find $k$ such that $3k^2 - 3k + 1 \leq 2026$.
We have $3k^2 - 3k - 2025 \leq 0$.
The quadratic formula gives $k = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4(3)(2025)}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{24309}}{6} \approx \frac{3 \pm 155.91}{6}$.
Since $k>0$, we take $k \approx \frac{158.91}{6} \approx 26.48$.
So, let's try $k=26$.
Then $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
Let's try $k=27$.
Then $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
So, 2026 is in the 27th layer.
Let's find the numbers around 2026.
When $k=26$, we have $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 1951$.
When $k=26$, we have $3(26^2) + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
The numbers in layer 26 are from $1951$ to $3(26)^2 - 3(26) + 6(26) = 1951 + 6(26) = 1951 + 156 = 2107$.
The 26th layer is between 1951 and $1951+6(26)=2107$.
2026 is in the 26th layer.
The number of integers in layer $k$ is $6k$.
If we are at $n$, the neighbors are $n \pm 1$, $n \pm (n-1)$, $n \pm (n+1)$.
The number of integers up to $n$ is $1 + 6(1+2+\ldots+(k-1)) = 1 + 6 \frac{k(k-1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1) = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$.
The neighbors of $n$ are in the adjacent layers.
Let $n = 2026$. The layer is $k=27$.
We have $2026 \approx 3k^2 - 3k + 1 \rightarrow 2026 = 3k^2 - 3k + x$.
For $n=1$, neighbors are $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, sum is 27.
The neighbors are $n - (k-1)$, $n - (k-1) + 1$.
Let's consider the neighbors of 1. Sum = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27.
$2026-27$, then find neighbors.
If we let $x=2026$, then $3k^2 - 3k + 1 = 1951$.
The neighbors of 2026 are $n \pm 1$, $n \pm (k)$, $n \pm (k-1)$.
The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$.
Then the sum of the neighbors is $6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
