Let the spiral be centered at the number 1.
The numbers in the spiral are laid out on a hexagonal grid.
The number 1 has 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
The number 2 has neighbors 1, 3, 9.
The number 3 has neighbors 2, 4, 10.
The number 4 has neighbors 3, 5, 11.
The number 5 has neighbors 4, 6, 12.
The number 6 has neighbors 5, 7, 13.
The number 7 has neighbors 1, 6, 8, 14.
We can consider the hexagonal layers around the number 1.
Layer 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (sum: 27)
Layer 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (sum: 168)
In the spiral, let $N$ be the position of the number $n$.
The number 1 is in position (0,0).
Let $L(n)$ be the number of layers the number $n$ is away from 1.
We want to find the six neighbors of 2026.
If $n = 3k^2-3k+1$, then the number $n$ is in the center of the outer layer $k$.
$2026 \approx 3k^2$
$k^2 \approx \frac{2026}{3} = 675.33$
$k \approx \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98$
Let $k=26$. Then $3k^2 - 3k + 1 = 3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
Let $k=26$. Then $3k^2+3k+1 = 3(26)^2+3(26)+1 = 2028+78+1 = 2107$.
If we assume that 2026 is close to the corner of a hexagon, then the neighbors are
2025, 2027, $2026 \pm 1$, $2026-6(25)$, $2026+6(26)$.
We can observe that the difference between the numbers in the spiral is usually 1.
The neighbors are approximately $n \pm 1$, $n-x$, $n+y$, $n-z$, $n+w$, where x,y,z,w are small differences.
The six neighbors are roughly $2026 \pm 1, 2026 \pm 26$.
We can assume the neighbors are $2026 \pm 1$, and then we have to consider the orientation.
The distance from 1 to 2026 is approximately 26.
The six neighbors of 2026 can be approximately:
2025, 2027, $2026 \pm \Delta$.
The distance to the corners is approximately $k$.
If we are at the center of the layer, then $n = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$, and the neighbors are $3k^2-3k, 3k^2-3k+2, 3k^2-3k+1 \pm 1$.
The numbers are arranged in a hexagonal fashion.
Let $n = 2026$. We want to find the sum of the neighbors of $n$.
Let's consider the spiral.
We can estimate that the neighbors will have numbers close to $n$.
$n-1$, $n+1$, $n-x$, $n+y$, $n-z$, $n+w$.
Sum is $6n + (-1+1-x+y-z+w)$.
We have $2025, 2027$.
Neighbors are $2025, 2027, x, y, z, w$.
The sum of neighbors is 12156.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
