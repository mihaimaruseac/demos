Let $n$ be the number on the hexagonal grid. We want to find the six neighbors of the number 2026.

First, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral. The numbers are written in a hexagonal spiral. We can represent the numbers in the grid using coordinates $(i,j)$, where $i$ and $j$ are integers.
The numbers in the grid can be arranged in concentric hexagons. The center is 1. The next layer has 6 numbers, then 12, then 18, and so on.
The number of elements in the layers are: 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, ...
The $k$-th layer has $6(k-1)$ elements. The numbers in the first few layers are:
Layer 0: 1
Layer 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Layer 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Layer 3: 20, 21, ..., 37
...

The number of elements in the layers up to layer $k$ is given by
$S(k) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6 \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 3k(k+1)$
We want to find $k$ such that $S(k-1) < 2026 \le S(k)$.
$1 + 3(k-1)k < 2026 \le 1 + 3k(k+1)$
$3k^2 - 3k < 2025 \le 3k^2 + 3k + 1$
$k^2 - k < 675 \le k^2 + k + \frac{1}{3}$
We can approximate $k^2 \approx 675$, so $k \approx \sqrt{675} \approx 25.98$.
Let's try $k=26$.
$S(25) = 1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$
$S(26) = 1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$
So, the number 2026 is in the layer $k=26$.
The values of the numbers in layer 26 are between 1952 and 2107.
Let's find the position of 2026 in layer 26.
$2026 - 1951 = 75$
Since each layer has 6(26-1) = 150 numbers, we have 6 sides with 25 numbers each.
We can think of the spiral as going around the center clockwise.
The 6 neighbors of a number $n$ are in the surrounding hexagon.
If $n = 1$, the neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and their sum is 27.
Since the layer is 26, the numbers in layer 26 go from 1952 to 2107.
Since $2026$ is in layer 26, its neighbors are in layers 25 and 26.
We can imagine the number 2026. Its neighbors will be in the layer 25 and the same layer 26.
Since $2026 - 1951 = 75$, the number is close to the middle of the side.
Let the neighbors be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$.
We need the sum of the 6 neighbors of 2026.
Consider the neighbors of $N$, where $N > 1$.
The sum of the neighbors is $6N - 6$.
Sum of neighbors of 2026 $\approx 6(2026) - 6$ is wrong.
Sum of neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + x + y + z + w
The sum of neighbors is $6(2026) - 6 = 12150$ is not correct.
Let $n_1, \dots, n_6$ be the neighbors.
$\sum n_i = 6n - \text{something}$

The neighbors of 2026 are 1951, 1952, 2025, 2027, 2106, 2107.
We can look at $n-1, n-26+1-1, n+26-1, n+1$.

The six neighbors are
1951 + 1952 + 2025 + 2027 + 2106 + 2107 = 12168
$n-1, n-k, n-k-1, n+1, n+k, n+k-1$.
Sum of neighbors is $6n - 6$ is for 1.
The neighbors are 1951, 2025, 2106, 2107, 2027, 1952
The sum of these is $1951+1952+2025+2027+2106+2107 = 12168$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12168}$
