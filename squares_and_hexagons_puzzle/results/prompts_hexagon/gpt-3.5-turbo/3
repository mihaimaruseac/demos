The hexagonal grid follows a pattern of increasing numbers in a spiral. By observing the grid layout, we can determine the position of the number 2026. 

Starting from the center (1), we move outwards in the spiral until we reach or pass the number 2026. By counting, we find that 2026 is the seventh number outwards from the center. 

To find the six neighbors of 2026, we consider the neighboring numbers in the spiral layout. The six neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2024, 2027, 2030, 2031, and 2029.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is:
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2030 + 2031 + 2029 = 12166. 

So, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12166.
