To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the coordinates of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid.

Let's look at a smaller portion of the spiral:

... 24 23 22 21 20 19 ...
.. 25 10 9 8 7 18 ...
... 26 11 2 1 6 17 ...
.... 27 12 3 4 5 16 ...
.... 28 13 14 15 ...

From the grid above, we can see that the number 2026 is in the outer layer of the spiral. More specifically, it is in the 79th layer of the spiral, and on the 79th segment of that layer.

To find the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we can calculate the numbers in the neighboring segments:

2026 - Segment 78: 2026 - 6 = 2020
2026 - Segment 77: 2026 - 5 = 2021
2026 - Segment 76: 2026 - 4 = 2022
2026 - Segment 75: 2026 - 3 = 2023
2026 - Segment 80: 2026 + 6 = 2032
2026 - Segment 81: 2026 + 7 = 2033

Now we can sum up these 6 neighbors:

2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2032 + 2033 = 12151

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12151.
