To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to first determine the position of the number 2026 on the hexagonal grid.

The hexagonal grid is laid out in a spiral pattern, with the center of the grid being the number 1. The numbers increase in a clockwise spiral pattern, with each new layer of the spiral adding 6 additional numbers.

Starting from the center (1), we can calculate the position of each layer of the spiral as follows:
- Layer 1: 1 (1 number)
- Layer 2: 2 to 7 (6 numbers)
- Layer 3: 8 to 19 (12 numbers)
- Layer 4: 20 to 37 (18 numbers)
- ...

The position of the number 2026 can be calculated by finding the layer of the spiral it lies on. We know that layer 1 has 1 number, layer 2 has 6 numbers, and layer 3 has 12 numbers. The total number of numbers on layers 1 to 3 is 1 + 6 + 12 = 19. Therefore, the number 2026 lies on layer 4.

To find the position of the number 2026 on layer 4, we can subtract the total number of numbers on layers 1 to 3 from 2026:
2026 - 19 = 2007

Therefore, the number 2026 is the 2007th number on layer 4 of the hexagonal grid.

Now we need to calculate the 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on layer 4 of the hexagonal grid.

Starting from the number 2026, the 6 neighbors will be in the following positions:
- 2026 - 1 = 2025
- 2025 - 18 = 2007
- 2007 + 1 = 2008
- 2008 + 1 = 2009
- 2009 + 18 = 2027
- 2027 + 1 = 2028

Now we can calculate the sum of these 6 neighbors:
2025 + 2007 + 2008 + 2009 + 2027 + 2028 = 12004

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12004.
