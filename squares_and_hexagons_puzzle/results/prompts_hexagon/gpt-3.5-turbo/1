To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of a number on the spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid, we need to identify its position in relation to the center of the grid and then calculate the sum of the 6 neighboring numbers.

In this case, the number 2026 lies on the third "ring" of the spiral laid out on the hexagonal grid. The numbers on the third ring are as follows:

15 16 17 18 ...
4 1 2 19 20 ...
14 5 2026 7 8 ...
13 6 3 9 10 ...
12 11 10 ...

Now we can calculate the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026:

15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 7 = 92

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 92.
