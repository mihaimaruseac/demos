To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we can follow the spiral pattern of the hexagonal grid to identify its surrounding numbers:

2027  2028  ...
2025  2026  2010
2019  2020  2021  2022
2018  2012  2011  2015
2017  2016  2025  2024  ...

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is:
2027 + 2028 + 2025 + 2010 + 2019 + 2018 = 2027 + 2028 + 2025 + 2010 + 2019 + 2018 = 12027

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12027.
