To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to identify the position of 2026 on the spiral laid out on the hexagonal grid. Since the grid is not completely shown, we will need to determine it based on the pattern.

The spiral sequence on the hexagonal grid follows a specific pattern where each layer of the spiral consists of 6n numbers, where n is the layer number starting from n=0 at the center. Additionally, each layer increases by 6 from the previous layer.

Let's find the position of 2026 on the spiral:

Layer 0: 1 number (center) - 1 number in total
Layer 1: 6 numbers - 6 numbers in total
Layer 2: 12 numbers - 18 numbers in total
Layer 3: 18 numbers - 36 numbers in total
...

To find the layer number that contains 2026, we calculate the total numbers in each layer until we reach a value greater than 2026:

Layer 0: 1
Layer 1: 1 + 6 = 7
Layer 2: 7 + 6 + 6 = 19
Layer 3: 19 + 12 + 6 = 37
...

Since 2026 falls between the 36th and 37th number on layer 3, we conclude that 2026 is on the 3rd layer.

Now, we need to determine the position of 2026 within the 3rd layer such that we can find its neighbors and calculate their sum.

Layer 3 consists of 18 numbers and the numbers increase by 6. We can calculate the starting number of the 3rd layer:

1 + 1*6 (for layer 1) + 2*6 (for layer 2) = 13

So, the starting number of the 3rd layer is 13 and 2026 is 2026 - 13 = 2013 positions away from the starting number within the same layer.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 3rd layer:

2026 = 13 + 6n (position within the 3rd layer)
6n = 2013
n = 335

Therefore, 2026 is the 335th number on the 3rd layer.

Now, we can find the neighbors of 2026 on the hexagonal grid and calculate their sum. The neighbors include the 6 numbers closest to 2026 on the hexagonal grid.

By observing the pattern of the spiral, we can identify the neighbors of 2026 are:
2017, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2028, 2027

Sum of the neighbors = 2017 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2028 + 2027 = 12118

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12118.
