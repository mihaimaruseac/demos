To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral, we need to determine the numbers surrounding 2026 on the hexagonal grid. 

Starting from the center and moving outwards on the spiral, we can see that 2026 is one of the numbers on the corner of a hexagon. The six neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it on the hexagon. 

The numbers surrounding 2026 are 2021, 2025, 2035, 2050, 2049, and 2034. 

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is: 

2021 + 2025 + 2035 + 2050 + 2049 + 2034 = 12114. 

So, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12114.
