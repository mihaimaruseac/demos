To find the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the location of 2026 on the hexagonal grid.

Since the numbers are laid out on a spiral, we can determine the layer of the spiral that 2026 is on. The sum of the numbers on each layer of the spiral is given by the formula: 3*n*(n+1) + 1, where n is the layer number.

By plugging in values of n into the formula, we can determine that 2026 is on the 17th layer of the spiral.

Next, we find the position of 2026 on the 17th layer of the spiral. Since the last number on the 17th layer is 2025, we know that 2026 is the first number on the 18th layer of the spiral.

Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 are the numbers 2020, 2025, 2027, 2044, 2045, and 2043.

Calculating the sum of these neighbors:
2020 + 2025 + 2027 + 2044 + 2045 + 2043 = 12104

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12104.
