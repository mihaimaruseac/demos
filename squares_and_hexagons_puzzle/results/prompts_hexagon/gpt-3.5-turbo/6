To find the 6 neighbors of a number on the spiral hexagonal grid, we need to find the surrounding numbers that are adjacent to the given number.

The number 2026 is surrounded by the following numbers on the spiral hexagonal grid:

2020 2021
2019 2026 2022
2018 2017

Now we can calculate the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026:

2020 + 2021 + 2019 + 2022 + 2018 + 2017 = 12097

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12097.
