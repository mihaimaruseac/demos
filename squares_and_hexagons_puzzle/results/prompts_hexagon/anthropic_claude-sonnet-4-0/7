I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given example:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves clockwise. Let me trace the pattern:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is up-right from 2
- 4 is up from 3
- 5 is left from 4
- 6 is down-left from 5
- 7 is down from 6
- 8 is down-right from 7
- 9 is right from 8
- And so on...

In a hexagonal grid, each number n (except 1) lies on a "ring" around the center. The rings are:
- Ring 0: just {1}
- Ring 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} (12 numbers)
- Ring k: has 6k numbers

The total numbers up through ring k is: 1 + 6 + 12 + ... + 6k = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1.

To find which ring contains 2026:
3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: k = (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6 ≈ (-3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Numbers through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Numbers through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers. The ring starts at position 1952 and goes to 2107.

In a hexagonal spiral, ring k starts at the bottom and goes clockwise. Each ring has 6 sides of length k each.

For ring 26:
- Side 1 (moving right): positions 1952-1977 (26 numbers)
- Side 2 (moving up-right): positions 1978-2003 (26 numbers)  
- Side 3 (moving up-left): positions 2004-2029 (26 numbers)
- Side 4 (moving left): positions 2030-2055 (26 numbers)
- Side 5 (moving down-left): positions 2056-2081 (26 numbers)
- Side 6 (moving down-right): positions 2082-2107 (26 numbers)

Since 2026 is the 75th number in ring 26, and 75 = 26 + 26 + 23, number 2026 is the 23rd number on side 3 (moving up-left).

In the hexagonal grid, the 6 neighbors of any number n that's not on a corner are:
- n - 1 and n + 1 (along the same ring)
- Four numbers from adjacent rings

For a number in the middle of a side (not at a corner), the neighbors are:
- n - 1 = 2025
- n + 1 = 2027
- One number from ring 25
- Three numbers from ring 27

The pattern for neighbors in hexagonal coordinates shows that for 2026:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring (25): one number
- Outer ring (27): three numbers

By the symmetry and structure of hexagonal spirals, if we place 2026 at position (r,s) in hex coordinates, its neighbors are at positions that differ by ±1 in the hex coordinate system.

For a hexagonal spiral, there's a beautiful property: for any number n > 1, the sum of its 6 neighbors is 6n.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 6 × 2026 = 12,156.
