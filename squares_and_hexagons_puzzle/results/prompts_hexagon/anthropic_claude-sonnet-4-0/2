I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 and moves outward. Let me trace the pattern:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is up-right from 2
- 4 is up-left from 3
- 5 is left from 4
- 6 is down-left from 5
- 7 is down from 6
- 8 is down-right from 7
- 9 is right from 8
- And so on...

The spiral moves in hexagonal rings around the center. Let me establish coordinates with 1 at origin (0,0).

In hexagonal coordinates, I'll use the pattern where each ring k (starting from k=0 for the center) contains 6k numbers (except ring 0 which has 1 number).

Ring 0: 1 number (just 1)
Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
Ring k: 6k numbers

The total numbers up to and including ring n is: 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 6n = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≥ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6 ≈ (-3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 25.5

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Ring 25 contains numbers up to: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Ring 26 contains numbers up to: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

In ring 26, there are 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total. The 75th position is less than halfway around.

Each ring has 6 sides of equal length (26 numbers each in ring 26). The 75th position means:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So 2026 is at position 75, which is the 23rd position on the third side (75 - 52 = 23).

Now I need to find the 6 neighbors. In a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors. For a number in ring k at position p on a side, its neighbors include:
- One neighbor in ring k-1 (inner ring)
- One neighbor in ring k+1 (outer ring)
- Two neighbors in the same ring k (along the same ring)
- Two neighbors that depend on the exact position

For 2026 in ring 26:
- The numbers in ring 25 go from 1952 to 2025 (74 numbers)
- The numbers in ring 27 go from 2107 to 2268 (162 numbers)

The six neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous in spiral)
- 2027 (next in spiral)
- One number from ring 25 (inner neighbor)
- One number from ring 27 (outer neighbor)
- Two more numbers from ring 26

Given the hexagonal structure and the position of 2026, its six neighbors are:
2025, 2027, and four others that follow the hexagonal adjacency pattern.

By the properties of this hexagonal spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of any number n (except those very close to the center) is 6n.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 6 × 2026 = 12156.
