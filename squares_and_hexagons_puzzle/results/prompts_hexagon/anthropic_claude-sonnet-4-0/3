I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward. From 1, it goes:
- 1 → 2 (right)
- 2 → 3 (up-right)
- 3 → 4 (up-left)  
- 4 → 5 (left)
- 5 → 6 (down-left)
- 6 → 7 (down-right)
- 7 → 8 (right)
- 8 → 9 (right)
- And so on...

This is a hexagonal spiral where we complete each "ring" around the center before moving to the next ring.

Let me analyze the ring structure:
- Ring 0: just {1}
- Ring 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} (12 numbers)
- Ring k: 6k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The total numbers up to and including ring k is:
1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 6 × k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026.

For ring k: 3k² + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026
3k² + 3k + 1 - 2026 ≥ 0
3k² + 3k - 2025 ≥ 0
k² + k - 675 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: k = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2

√2701 ≈ 51.97, so k ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Numbers through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Numbers through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers, numbered from 1952 to 2107.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides of length k (where k is the ring number). The 75th position in ring 26:
- Side 1: positions 1-26 (numbers 1952-1977)
- Side 2: positions 27-52 (numbers 1978-2003)  
- Side 3: positions 53-78 (numbers 2004-2029)

So 2026 is at position 75, which is the 23rd number on side 3 (since 75 - 52 = 23).

For any number not at a corner of the hexagon, its 6 neighbors are:
- The number before and after it in the same ring
- 2 numbers in the inner ring (k-1 = 25)
- 2 numbers in the outer ring (k+1 = 27)

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025 and 2027
- Inner ring (ring 25): I need to find the corresponding positions
- Outer ring (ring 27): I need to find the corresponding positions

For a hexagonal spiral, if a number n is at position p in ring k, its neighbors in adjacent rings can be calculated based on the geometric relationship.

However, there's a more direct approach. In a hexagonal spiral, for any number n (except 1), the sum of its 6 neighbors equals 6n.

This is a property of hexagonal spirals: each number (except the center) is the average of its 6 neighbors.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 6 × 2026 = 12,156.
