I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 and moves clockwise. From 1:
- 1 → 2 (right)
- 2 → 3 (up-right) 
- 3 → 4 (up-left)
- 4 → 5 (left)
- 5 → 6 (down-left)
- 6 → 7 (down-right)
- 7 → 8 (right)
- 8 → 9 (right)
- 9 → 10 (up-right)

This is a hexagonal spiral where we complete hexagonal "rings" around the center.

Let me analyze the ring structure:
- Ring 0: just {1}
- Ring 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: {20, 21, ..., 37} (18 numbers)

In general, ring n (for n ≥ 1) contains 6n numbers.

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
1 + 6(1) + 6(2) + ... + 6(n) = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 · n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-3 ± √(9 + 4·3·2025))/6 = (-3 ± √24309)/6

√24309 ≈ 155.9, so n ≈ (-3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 25.48

So n = 25. Let me check:
- Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

Since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107, number 2026 is in ring 26.

Ring 26 starts at number 1952 and ends at 2107.
So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

In a hexagonal ring, there are 6 sides each of length n. For ring 26, each side has 26 numbers.
- Side 1: positions 1-26 (numbers 1952-1977)
- Side 2: positions 27-52 (numbers 1978-2003) 
- Side 3: positions 53-78 (numbers 2004-2029)

So 2026 is at position 75 in ring 26, which puts it on side 3 at position 75-52 = 23 within that side.

For any number in the middle of a side (not at corners), its 6 neighbors are:
- 2 neighbors in the same ring (adjacent positions in the spiral)
- 2 neighbors in the inner ring (ring 25)
- 2 neighbors in the outer ring (ring 27)

The adjacent numbers in ring 26 are 2025 and 2027.

For the inner ring neighbors: Ring 25 has 6×25 = 150 numbers (from 1802 to 1951).
For the outer ring neighbors: Ring 27 starts at 2108.

In hexagonal grids, if a number N is at position p in ring r, its inner neighbors are approximately at positions around p×(r-1)/r in ring r-1, and outer neighbors at positions around p×(r+1)/r in ring r+1.

For 2026 at position 75 in ring 26:
- Inner ring positions ≈ 75×25/26 ≈ 72.1, so around positions 72-73 in ring 25
- Ring 25 starts at 1802, so neighbors are around 1802+71=1873 and 1802+72=1874
- Outer ring positions ≈ 75×27/26 ≈ 77.9, so around positions 77-78 in ring 27  
- Ring 27 starts at 2108, so neighbors are around 2108+76=2184 and 2108+77=2185

Therefore, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1873, 1874, 2184, 2185.

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168
