I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
```

I can see that 1 is at the center, and the spiral moves outward. Let me trace the path:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is above 2
- 4 is to the upper-left of 3
- 5 is to the left of 4
- 6 is to the lower-left of 5
- 7 is below 6
- 8 is to the lower-right of 7
- 9 is to the right of 8
- And so on...

This is a hexagonal spiral that moves: right, up-right, up-left, left, down-left, down-right, then repeats this pattern for larger rings.

Let me establish the ring structure:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2,3,4,5,6,7 (6 numbers)
- Ring 2: 8,9,10,...,19 (12 numbers)
- Ring 3: 20,21,22,...,37 (18 numbers)
- Ring k: has 6k numbers

The total numbers up to ring k is: 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + ... + 6k = 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 6k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1) = 3k² + 3k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026.

Let me solve 3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026:
3k² + 3k + 1 = 2026
3k² + 3k - 2025 = 0
k² + k - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: k = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2 = (-1 ± 51.97)/2

Since k must be positive: k ≈ 25.485

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Ring 25 ends at: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Ring 26 ends at: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal ring, the spiral moves in 6 directions, each side having 26 numbers.
- Side 1 (right): positions 1-26 in the ring
- Side 2 (up-right): positions 27-52 in the ring  
- Side 3 (up-left): positions 53-78 in the ring
- Side 4 (left): positions 79-104 in the ring
- Side 5 (down-left): positions 105-130 in the ring
- Side 6 (down-right): positions 131-156 in the ring

Since 2026 is at position 75 in ring 26, it's on side 3 (up-left), at position 75 - 52 = 23 along that side.

For any number in a hexagonal spiral, its 6 neighbors are:
- The number before and after it in the same ring (if they exist)
- Numbers in the adjacent inner and outer rings

For 2026 at position 75 in ring 26:
- Previous in ring: 2025
- Next in ring: 2027
- The other 4 neighbors are in rings 25 and 27

By the symmetry of hexagonal spirals, if a number n is not at a corner of its ring, its 6 neighbors sum to 6n.

Since position 23 out of 26 on a side is not at a corner, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is:

6 × 2026 = 12156
