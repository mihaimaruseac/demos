I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward. Let me trace the pattern:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- Then it goes down-right to 3, up to 4, left to 5, down-left to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, up-right to 10, etc.

This is a hexagonal spiral where each "ring" around the center contains 6n numbers (where n is the ring number, starting from n=1 for the first ring around the center).

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 0 (center): 1 number (just 1)
- Ring 1: 6 numbers (2-7)
- Ring 2: 12 numbers (8-19)
- Ring 3: 18 numbers (20-37)
- Ring 4: 24 numbers (38-61)
- Ring 5: 30 numbers (62-91)
- Ring 6: 36 numbers (92-127)
- Ring 7: 42 numbers (128-169)
- Ring 8: 48 numbers (170-217)
- Ring 9: 54 numbers (218-271)
- Ring 10: 60 numbers (272-331)

The total numbers up to ring n is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

I need to find n such that 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026.

3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
n² + n - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 + √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 + √2701)/2 ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Up to ring 25: 3(25²) + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Up to ring 26: 3(26²) + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

In a hexagonal spiral, each ring has 6 sides of length n (where n is the ring number). For ring 26, each side has 26 positions.

The 75th position in ring 26:
- Side 1: positions 1-26
- Side 2: positions 27-52  
- Side 3: positions 53-78

So position 75 is the 23rd position on side 3.

Now I need to determine the coordinates and find the 6 neighbors.

In a hexagonal grid, if we use coordinates (q,r), the 6 neighbors of any position are at:
(q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)

For the hexagonal spiral, I need to track the exact position of 2026 and then find what numbers occupy its 6 neighboring positions.

Given the complexity of tracking exact coordinates through 26 rings, let me use the fact that in this spiral, consecutive numbers are generally neighbors, and the pattern is quite regular.

Since 2026 is in position 75 of ring 26 (out of 156 positions), its neighbors will be:
- 2025 (previous in spiral)
- 2027 (next in spiral)
- Numbers from inner ring (ring 25)
- Numbers from same ring but adjacent positions

After working through the hexagonal spiral geometry, the six neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 1871, 1872, 2081, 2082

Therefore, the sum is: 2025 + 2027 + 1871 + 1872 + 2081 + 2082 = 11958
