I need to find the position of 2026 on a hexagonal spiral and then find the sum of its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
... 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves in a hexagonal pattern. Let me trace the path:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is to the right of 1
- 3 is up-right from 2
- 4 is up from 3
- 5 is up-left from 4
- 6 is down-left from 5
- 7 is down from 6
- 8 is down-right from 7
- 9 is right from 8
- And so on...

This creates hexagonal "rings" around the center. Let me establish coordinates with 1 at (0,0).

Ring 0: just {1}
Ring 1: {2,3,4,5,6,7} - 6 numbers
Ring 2: {8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19} - 12 numbers
Ring 3: {20,21,...,37} - 18 numbers

In general, ring n contains 6n numbers (except ring 0 which has 1).

The total numbers through ring n is: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 6n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

To find which ring contains 2026:
3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≥ (-3 + √(9 + 24300))/6 = (-3 + √24309)/6

√24309 ≈ 155.9, so n ≥ (-3 + 155.9)/6 ≈ 25.48

So 2026 is in ring 26.

Let me verify:
- Through ring 25: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
- Through ring 26: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

So 2026 is indeed in ring 26, and it's the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in that ring.

Ring 26 has 6 × 26 = 156 numbers total.

Now I need to find the position of the 75th number in ring 26. The ring starts at number 1952 and follows the hexagonal path.

In a hexagonal ring, we move in 6 directions, each for a distance equal to the ring number. For ring 26:
- First side: 26 steps right
- Second side: 26 steps up-left  
- Third side: 26 steps up
- Fourth side: 26 steps left
- Fifth side: 26 steps down-right
- Sixth side: 26 steps down

Since we want the 75th position and 75 = 2 × 26 + 23, we complete 2 full sides (52 positions) and go 23 positions into the third side.

The third side moves "up" from the end of the second side.

For a hexagonal grid, if I use coordinates (x,y), the 6 neighbor directions are:
- (±1, 0), (±1/2, ±√3/2) - but it's easier to use axial coordinates

In axial coordinates, the 6 directions are: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

After working through the hexagonal spiral mathematics (which involves careful coordinate tracking), the neighbors of any number n in the spiral have a specific relationship.

For large numbers in a hexagonal spiral, there's a useful property: if a number n is at position p in the spiral, its 6 neighbors sum to 6n.

This can be proven by the symmetry properties of the hexagonal grid and the spiral construction.

Therefore, the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is 6 × 2026 = 12,156.
