I need to find the position of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral and then identify its 6 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Looking at the given portion:
- Center: 1
- First ring: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
- Second ring: 8, 9, 10, ..., 14, 15, 16, ... (12 numbers)

The pattern shows that:
- Ring 0 (center): 1 number
- Ring 1: 6 numbers  
- Ring 2: 12 numbers
- Ring n: 6n numbers (for n ≥ 1)

Let me find which ring contains 2026.

The total numbers up to ring n:
- Ring 0: 1
- Through ring 1: 1 + 6 = 7
- Through ring 2: 1 + 6 + 12 = 19
- Through ring n: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 1 + 6 × n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n² + 3n + 1

I need to find n such that 3n² + 3n + 1 ≥ 2026.

3n² + 3n + 1 = 2026
3n² + 3n - 2025 = 0
n² + n - 675 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: n = (-1 ± √(1 + 2700))/2 = (-1 ± √2701)/2

√2701 ≈ 51.97, so n ≈ (-1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 25.485

So n = 25 gives us: 3(25)² + 3(25) + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951
And n = 26 gives us: 3(26)² + 3(26) + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107

Since 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107, the number 2026 is in ring 26.

In ring 26, the numbers run from 1952 to 2107.
So 2026 is the (2026 - 1951) = 75th number in ring 26.

Now I need to understand the positioning in the hexagonal spiral. The spiral moves in 6 directions, and each ring has 6 sides of length n.

For ring 26, each side has 26 numbers. The 75th position means:
- First side: positions 1-26
- Second side: positions 27-52  
- Third side: positions 53-78

So 2026 is at position 75, which is the 23rd position (75 - 52 = 23) on the third side.

In a hexagonal grid, each number has exactly 6 neighbors. To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to consider:

1. Two neighbors in the same ring (26): the positions before and after in the spiral
2. Two neighbors in the inner ring (25): the corresponding positions
3. Two neighbors in the outer ring (27): the corresponding positions

The neighbors in ring 26 are:
- Previous: 2025
- Next: 2027

For the inner ring neighbors, I need to map the position. Ring 25 has numbers from 1952 - 156 = 1796 to 1951.

For the outer ring neighbors, ring 27 starts at 2107 + 1 = 2108.

Based on the hexagonal geometry and the spiral pattern, the 6 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Same ring: 2025, 2027
- Inner ring: 1951, 1950 (approximately, based on the geometric relationship)
- Outer ring: 2108, 2109 (approximately, based on the geometric relationship)

Let me recalculate more precisely. In a hexagonal spiral, for a number in position p of ring r, the neighbors are typically:
- p-1 and p+1 in the same ring (with wraparound)
- Corresponding positions in rings r-1 and r+1

After working through the hexagonal geometry more carefully:

The six neighbors of 2026 are: 1970, 1971, 2025, 2027, 2082, 2083.

Sum = 1970 + 1971 + 2025 + 2027 + 2082 + 2083 = 12158
