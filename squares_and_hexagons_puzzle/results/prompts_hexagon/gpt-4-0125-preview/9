To determine the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in this hexagonal spiral, we need to understand the pattern that governs their placement first. Given that this is a hexagonal grid, each number has 6 neighbors, unless it's on the outer boundary of the complete grid. The pattern starts with 1 in the center, and numbers increase as we spiral outwards.

### Identifying 2026's Position

The spiral expands outward in layers. The center (1) is surrounded by a layer of 6 numbers, the next layer contains 12 numbers, and so forth, with each new hexagonal layer containing 6 more numbers than the last one.

Layer 1 consists of 1 number only (the number 1 itself).
Layer 2 has 6 numbers (2 through 7).
Layer 3 has 12 numbers (8 through 19), continuing this pattern.

The nth layer will have \(6(n - 1)\) numbers if \(n > 1\).

### Calculating the Layer of 2026

To find the layer in which 2026 resides, we need to find the value of n for which the sum of all numbers from layer 2 up to layer n exceeds or equals 2026. The total number of numbers up to the nth layer can be found by 

\[
1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + \dots + 6(n-1)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a = 6\), the common difference \(d = 6\), and \(n-1\) terms. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n-1)d] \text{, for \(n > 1\)}
\]

Including the center, the total becomes

\[
1 + \frac{n-1}{2} [2(6) + (n-2)(6)] = 1 + 3(n-1)(n-1)
\]

We replace \(S_n\) with 2026 to solve for \(n\):

\[
2026 = 1 + 3(n-1)^2
\]

Simplifying,

\[
2025 = 3(n-1)^2
\]

\[
675 = (n-1)^2
\]

\(n-1 = \sqrt{675}\)

\(n-1 \approx 25.98\)

Since \(n\) must be an integer, \(n = 26 + 1 = 27\), indicating that 2026 is in the 27th layer.

### Locating Neighbors

Given its place in the 27th layer, the numbers spiraling outwards increase sequentially. The neighbors of a given number in this grid follow a certain pattern:

1. Directly before and after it in the sequence.
2. Two numbers located adjacent but in the layers inside and outside relative to the spiraled path.

However, this grid's specific layout and the neighbors' exact numerical values require understanding the precise mathematical relationship between the numbers, which is complex because of the sequence's nature on a hexagonal grid. Identifying direct neighbors without a visual or algorithmic model is challenging and prone to errors.

### Answer Estimate
Given that finding an exact method for calculating the neighbors of 2026 directly from this description is complex and would generally require a more detailed analysis or a computational approach to accurately trace the number's exact location on the grid and identify its neighbors, it’s not straightforward to precisely provide the sum of all 6 neighbors without further information on the sequence's progression or without an algorithm designed to map out each number's exact position on the grid.

For a precise answer, a closer examination of the hexagonal pattern and possibly a computer algorithm would be required to map numbers to their exact locations and hence calculate the neighbors directly.
