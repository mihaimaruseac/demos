<think>
The problem involves natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the snippet:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7, and then it goes outwards. Let me sketch this out.

Assume that 1 is at the center. Then, going clockwise or counterclockwise? Looking at the numbers: around 1, we have 2 and 5 in the same row, but in hex grid, each cell has six neighbors.

In the second row: 15,5,1,2,9. But 5 and 1 are adjacent, 1 and 2 are adjacent. Then above: 14,4,3,10. 4 is probably above 1, since 4 is next to 3 and 10, but also next to 5? This is a bit messy.

Perhaps I should assign coordinates to the hex grid. Hex grids can be represented with axial coordinates or offset coordinates. I recall that in a hexagonal spiral, the numbers are arranged in rings around the center.

Let me try to list the numbers in order. Start at 1. Then moving outwards. Typically, in a hexagonal spiral, you start at center, then add a ring of 6 cells, then a ring of 12, and so on.

The first ring (distance 1) has numbers 2 through 7? But in the snippet, around 1 we have 2,3,4,5,6,7? But in the text, it shows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc., but not all are neighbors of 1.

From the snippet: near 1, we have 2 and 5 mentioned. 15 is next to 5? Let's see the neighbors of 1.

From the grid:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3  10 ... so probably 4 is above 1, and 3 is next to 4, etc.

Row 2: 15  5  1  2  9  so 5 is left of 1, 2 is right of 1.

Row 3: 16  6  7  8  so 6 is below and left, 7 below, 8 below right.

But in a hex grid, each cell has six neighbors. For cell 1, neighbors should be: above, above-right, below-right, below, below-left, above-left.

From the grid, it seems:

- Right: 2

- Left: 5? But 5 is listed left, but in hex grid, left might be adjacent.

But 5 is directly left, and 2 directly right. Then above should be 4, since row above has 4 above 1? The first row has 14,4,3,10. 4 is above 1, and 3 is to the right of 4? But then 3 should be above-right of 1.

Similarly, below: row 3 has 16,6,7,8. 6 is below-left of 1? 7 is below, 8 below-right.

Let's list the neighbors of 1:

- Right: 2 (from row 2)

- Left: 5 (from row 2)

- Above: 4? (since above row has 4 above 1)

But above row has 14,4,3,10. If 1 is centered, and 4 is above it, then to the left of 4 is 14? But 14 might be above-left of 1.

Similarly, to the right of 4 is 3, which should be above-right of 1.

Then below: row 3 has 16,6,7,8. If 6 is below-left, 7 below, 8 below-right.

But what about below-left and above-left? For example, above-left of 1 should be adjacent to 1 and to 4 and to 5.

5 is left of 1, 4 is above 1, so above-left should be adjacent to both. In the grid, is there a number there? The snippet doesn't show it, but probably it's 15 or something.

In row 2, it starts with 15, then 5, so 15 is left of 5? So 15 is above-left of 1? Let's see.

Assume that from 1, moving left is 5, moving up-left is 15? But in hex grid, the neighbors are at directions: let's define the axes.

I recall that in a hexagonal lattice, we can use cube coordinates with x+y+z=0.

Set up a coordinate system. Let the center be (0,0,0). Then the six neighbors are at (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1). Since x+y+z=0.

Standard cube coordinates for hex grid: each direction: let's say q,r,s with q+r+s=0.

Neighbors of (0,0,0) are (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1).

Now, assign numbers. From the snippet, number 1 is at (0,0,0).

Number 2 is right of 1, so let's say direction (1,0,-1).

Number 5 is left of 1, so perhaps (-1,0,1).

Then above: number 4, which might be (0,1,-1).

Below: number 7? Row 3 has 7 below, but let's see.

In row 3: 16,6,7,8. Probably 7 is directly below, so (0,-1,1).

Then 6 is below-left, so (-1,0,1)? But that's where 5 is? Conflict.

Perhaps different orientation.

Maybe the grid is oriented with flat top or pointy top. In the snippet, it seems like flat top, since rows are horizontal.

In flat top hex grid, the neighbors are: left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right.

For cell 1 at (0,0):

- Right: 2 at (1,0) or something.

Set axial coordinates. Use two coordinates: q and r, with s = -q-r.

Neighbors: (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1). This is for pointy top, but for flat top, it might be different.

For flat top, neighbors are: (q+1,r), (q+1,r-1), (q,r-1), (q-1,r), (q-1,r+1), (q,r+1).

Let's define for cell at (q,r):

- East: (q+1,r)

- West: (q-1,r)

- Northeast: (q,r-1) or (q+1,r-1)? I need to be careful.

Standard for flat top: the neighbors are:

- NW: (q-1,r) or (q,r-1)? Let's think.

Typically, if rows are horizontal, and hexes are flat on top, then for a cell, neighbors are: left and right on the same row, then up-left and up-right on the row above, down-left and down-right on the row below.

In the snippet, row 2 has cells at y=0: say 15,5,1,2,9. So probably q increases to the right.

So let cell 1 be at (0,0).

Cell 2 is right of 1, so (1,0).

Cell 5 is left of 1, so (-1,0).

Now above, row 1: cells at y=1? Or y=-1? Usually y increases up or down.

In the snippet, row 1 is above row 2, so probably y increases downward or upward. Typically in math, y increases up, but in grids, often y increases down. To avoid confusion, let's say the row number.

Let the center row be r=0. Then row above is r=1 or r=-1? The snippet shows "..." so it's not symmetric, but likely the center is at r=0.

In row r=0: cells from q= -2 to 2 or something, but we have 15 at left, then 5,1,2,9 at right. So q from -2 to 2? 15 at q=-2, 5 at q=-1, 1 at q=0, 2 at q=1, 9 at q=2? But then neighbors of 1 should include q= -1,0,1 in r=0, but also r=1 and r=-1.

Row above: r= -1, say, with cells 14,4,3,10. Probably centered above 1.

So at r= -1, q=0 should be above 1, which is 4.

Then left of that is 14 at q= -1, r= -1? But in hex grid, the row above is offset.

In flat top hex grid, each row is offset by half a cell. Specifically, for even rows or odd rows, the q coordinates are shifted.

In this case, since the center is at (0,0), and it's probably an "even" row or "odd" row.

From the neighbors: cell at (0,0) should have neighbors at:

- (1,0) : east

- (-1,0) : west

- (0,-1) : northwest? Let's calculate.

For flat top, the neighbors are:

- East: (q+1,r)

- West: (q-1,r)

- Northeast: (q+1,r-1) or (q,r-1)? I need to recall.

I can use the fact that the distance from center determines the ring.

Let me list the numbers in order of the spiral.

Start at 1.

Then move to the next cell. From the snippet, after 1, it goes to 2, then probably to 3, etc.

The sequence is 1, then 2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc.

From the grid, after 1 is 2 (to the right), then it might go up to 3, but in the grid, above 2 is 3? In row 1, we have 3 and 4, with 4 above 1, 3 to the right of 4.

So likely, from 1, it goes to 2 (east), then from 2 it goes to 3 (northeast), then to 4 (northwest), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (southwest), then to 7 (south), then to 8 (southeast), then to 9 (east again), and so on.

Let's see the path: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> ...

From the grid: after 8, it goes to 9, which is in the same row as 2, since in row 2, after 2 is 9.

Then after 9, probably to 10, which is in row 1, to the right of 3? The snippet has 10 after 3 in row 1.

Row 1: 14,4,3,10 so after 3 is 10.

But 14 is before 4, so likely 14 is left of 4.

So sequence: from 8, it goes to 9 (east from 8? 8 is in row 3, at q=2 or something, 9 is in row 2 at q=2, but in hex grid, southeast from 8 might be 9.

Let's try to map it.

Assume cell 1 at (0,0).

Cell 2 at (1,0) (east).

Cell 3: northeast of 2? If we go to (1,-1) or (2,-1)? But (1,-1) might be above and left of 2.

In the grid, 3 is above 2? In row 1, 3 is to the right of 4, and 4 is above 1, so if 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then above 1 is (0,-1) for 4, and above 2 is (1,-1) for 3.

Yes, so cell 3 at (1,-1).

Then cell 4 at (0,-1).

Then cell 5 at (-1,0) (west of 1).

Then cell 6: southwest of 5? So at (-1,1) or something.

In row 3, we have 6,7,8. 6 is below-left, so probably at (-1,1), 7 at (0,1), 8 at (1,1).

Yes, so cell 6 at (-1,1), cell 7 at (0,1), cell 8 at (1,1).

Then cell 9: after 8, probably east to (2,1)? But in the grid, row 2 has 9 at the end, and row 2 is r=0, which has cells from q=-2 to q=2: 15(q=-2),5(q=-1),1(q=0),2(q=1),9(q=2). So at (2,0) is 9.

But from 8 at (1,1), how to get to 9 at (2,0)? In hex grid, from (1,1) to (2,0) is northeast? Depending on the orientation.

In flat top hex grid, from (q,r) to (q+1,r-1) is northeast.

Here from (1,1) to (2,0): q+1, r-1, so yes, northeast.

Then from 9 at (2,0), next is 10. Where is 10? In row 1, after 3 is 10, and row 1 is r=-1, so at (2,-1)? Since 3 is at (1,-1), so east to (2,-1) is 10.

Then probably to 11,12, etc.

But in the snippet, row 1 has 14,4,3,10, so 14 at left, then 4,3,10. So q-coordinates: if 4 at (0,-1), 3 at (1,-1), 10 at (2,-1), so 14 must be at (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) should be adjacent to 4 and 5.

5 is at (-1,0), 4 at (0,-1), so (-1,-1) is adjacent to both.

Yes, so cell 14 at (-1,-1)? But 14 is larger, and we are at smaller numbers.

The sequence should be in order: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,...

After 10, next should be 11. Where? Probably continuing east or something.

After 10 at (2,-1), next might be to (3,-1) or to northeast.

But in the spiral, after completing a ring, it starts the next ring.

Currently we have: center:1

First ring: cells 2 to 7: 2:(1,0),3:(1,-1),4:(0,-1),5:(-1,0),6:(-1,1),7:(0,1)? But cell 7 is at (0,1), but we have cell 8 at (1,1), which is also in the first ring? First ring should have 6 cells: from 2 to 7 inclusive, that's 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

But in our assignment, we have cell 8 at (1,1), which is not yet assigned. Cell 7 is at (0,1), cell 6 at (-1,1), so cell 8 at (1,1) should be part of the first ring? But 1 to 7 are assigned, so ring 0: cell 1

Ring 1: cells 2 to 7: positions: let's list:

- East: (1,0):2

- Northeast: (1,-1):3? But (1,-1) is not adjacent to center? Distance.

In axial coordinates, distance from (0,0) is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) but s=-q-r, so distance d = (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2, but since s=-q-r, and for hex grid, the distance is (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2? Standard formula is max(|q|, |r|, |s|) with s=-q-r, but since q+r+s=0, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 where dq,dr,ds are differences, but for position, the Manhattan distance in cube coordinates.

For a cell at (q,r), with s= -q-r, the distance from origin is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2.

For (1,0): s= -1-0= -1, |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1, sum=2, distance=1.

Similarly, (1,-1): s= -1-(-1)=0, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=0, sum=2, distance=1.

(0,-1): s= -0-(-1)=1, |q|=0,|r|=1,|s|=1, sum=2, distance=1.

(-1,0): s= -(-1)-0=1, |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1, sum=2, distance=1.

(-1,1): s= -(-1)-1=0, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=0, sum=2, distance=1.

(0,1): s= -0-1= -1, |q|=0,|r|=1,|s|=1, sum=2, distance=1.

So these six are all at distance 1.

Then cell 8 at (1,1): q=1,r=1,s= -2, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, sum=4, distance=2. So it's in the next ring.

Similarly, cell 9 at (2,0): q=2,r=0,s= -2, |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2, sum=4, distance=2.

Cell 10 at (2,-1): q=2,r= -1,s= -1, |q|=2,|r|=1,|s|=1, sum=4, distance=2.

Cell 11? Probably at (2,-2) or (1,-2), etc.

But in the sequence, after 7 at (0,1), it goes to 8 at (1,1), which is adjacent, then to 9 at (2,0), which is adjacent to 8? From (1,1) to (2,0): as I said, northeast, so yes adjacent.

Then to 10 at (2,-1), east from 9? From (2,0) to (2,-1)? But r decreases, so north, but in flat top, moving north might not be direct; actually, (2,0) to (2,-1) is not adjacent because the q-coordinate is the same, but in hex grid, same q, r differs by 1, but for flat top, when moving vertically, it's only if the row is aligned, but here rows are offset.

In this coordinate system, two cells are adjacent if |dq| <=1, |dr| <=1, and |dq + dr| <=1? Let's check the differences.

The vector between cells: for example, from (0,0) to (1,0): dq=1, dr=0

To (0,-1): dq=0, dr=-1

To (1,-1): dq=1, dr=-1

To (-1,0): dq=-1, dr=0

To (0,1): dq=0, dr=1

To (-1,1): dq=-1, dr=1

Now, the differences: dq and dr, and the sum dq+dr ranges from -1 to 1, but |dq| and |dr| are at most 1, and not both non-zero in a way that sum is large, but in this case, all these have |dq| <=1, |dr| <=1, and |dq + dr| <=1? For (1,-1): dq+dr=0, |0|<=1. For (1,0): sum=1, |1|<=1? But for a cell at distance 2, say (2,0): dq=2, dr=0, |dq|=2>1, so not adjacent. Good.

Adjacent if |dq| <=1, |dr| <=1, and |dq + dr| <=1? From (0,0) to (1,-1): dq=1, dr=-1, sum=0, |sum|=0<=1, and |dq|=1,|dr|=1<=1.

But is (1,-1) adjacent to (0,0)? Yes.

Now, from (1,1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=-1, same as above, so yes adjacent.

From (2,0) to (2,-1): dq=0, dr=-1, which is valid, so adjacent.

Now back to sequence. After 10 at (2,-1), next should be 11. Probably continue in the same direction. Currently moving east? From 9 to 10 was east (same r, q+1), so likely continue to (3,-1) for 11.

Then to (4,-1) for 12? But then it would keep going, but eventually it needs to turn.

After 10, it might turn. In spiral, after reaching a corner, it turns.

From the snippet, after 10, it might go to 11,12,13,14.

In row 1, it has 14,4,3,10, so 14 is at left, so probably q= -1,-1 for 14? Earlier I thought 14 at (-1,-1).

But (-1,-1) is at distance: q=-1,r=-1,s=2, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, sum=4, distance=2, same as others.

And sequence: after 10, if it goes to 11,12,13,14.

14 is at (-1,-1), which is northwest of 4 at (0,-1).

So likely, after 10 at (2,-1), it turns north or northwest.

But to get to (-1,-1), it needs to go left.

Probably it goes west along the top row.

So from 10 at (2,-1), next to (1,-1)? But (1,-1) is already occupied by 3.

3 is at (1,-1), so it can't go there.

Mistake.

The ring distance 2 should have more cells. Ring k has 6k cells for k>=1.

Ring 0: 1 cell

Ring 1: 6 cells (2 to 7)

Ring 2: 12 cells (8 to 19)

But in our assignment, we have cell 8 at (1,1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,-1), then next should be 11 at (2,-2)? Or (1,-2), etc.

But in the snippet, we have 14, which is probably in ring 2.

Let's list the positions for ring 2.

The cells at distance 2 from center.

Distance d=2 means (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 =2, so |q| + |r| + |q+r| =4.

Possible (q,r) with integer q,r.

For example: (2,0): |2|+|0|+|2+0|=2+0+2=4

(2,-1): |2|+|-1|+|2-1|=2+1+1=4

(2,-2): |2|+|-2|+|2-2|=2+2+0=4

(1,1): |1|+|1|+|1+1|=1+1+2=4

(1,-2): |1|+|-2|+|1-2|=1+2+1=4

(0,2): |0|+|2|+|0+2|=0+2+2=4

(0,-2): |0|+|-2|+|0-2|=0+2+2=4

(-1,2): | -1| + |2| + |-1+2| =1+2+1=4

(-1,-1): | -1| + |-1| + |-1-1| =1+1+2=4

(-2,1): | -2| + |1| + |-2+1| =2+1+1=4

(-2,0): | -2| + |0| + |-2+0| =2+0+2=4

(-2,-1): | -2| + |-1| + |-2-1| =2+1+3? |-3|=3, sum=6>4, no.

s= -q-r, |s|=|q+r|, so |q| + |r| + |q+r| =4.

For (q,r) = (2,0): 2+0+2=4

(2,-1):2+1+|1|=2+1+1=4

(2,-2):2+2+|0|=4

(1,1):1+1+|2|=1+1+2=4

(1,0):1+0+|1|=1+0+1=2<4, distance 1

(1,-1):1+1+|0|=2<4

(1,-2):1+2+|-1|=1+2+1=4

(0,2):0+2+2=4

(0,-2):0+2+2=4? |q+r|=| -2|=2, yes

(-1,2):1+2+|1|=1+2+1=4

(-1,1):1+1|0|=2<4

(-1,0):1+0+1=2<4

(-1,-1):1+1+|-2|=1+1+2=4

(-2,1):2+1+|-1|=2+1+1=4

(-2,0):2+0+2=4

(-2,-1):2+1+|-3|=2+1+3=6>4, not

(-2,2):2+2+|0|=4? q=-2,r=2,s=0, |q|=2,|r|=2,|s|=0, sum=4, distance=2.

I missed some.

Also (0,2), (0,-2), (-2,2), etc.

List all pairs where |q| + |r| + |q+r| =4.

Since s= -q-r, and |q| + |r| + |s| =4, and q,r,s integers, q+r+s=0.

The solutions are all (q,r) such that the maximum of |q|,|r|,|s| is 2, and since sum of abs is 4, it must be that the values are such that two are ±2, and the other is 0, or one is ±2, and the others are ±1,±1 with same sign or something.

Cases:

1. One coordinate 0, others ±2: e.g. (2,0,s=-2), ( -2,0,s=2), (0,2,s=-2), (0,-2,s=2), (2,-2,s=0), (-2,2,s=0) — but (2,-2): q=2,r=-2,s=0

( -2,2,s=0)

2. All coordinates non-zero: |q|,|r|,|s| sum to 4, each at least 1, so possibilities: 2,1,1 or 2,-1,-1 etc, but since sum abs, signs matter.

If |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, then s= -q-r, so | -q-r| = |q+r| =1.

So for q=2, |2+r|=1, so 2+r=1 or 2+r=-1, so r=-1 or r=-3.

r=-1: |r|=1, s= -2-(-1)= -1, |s|=1, good.

r=-3: |r|=3>1, not.

Similarly q=2, r=-1, s=-1.

Similarly q=-2, | -2 + r| =1, so -2+r=1 or -2+r=-1, r=3 or r=1.

r=3: |r|=3>1, no; r=1: |r|=1, s= -(-2)-1=2-1=1, |s|=1, good.

Similarly for other permutations.

So list:

- q=2,r=0,s=-2

- q=2,r=-1,s=-1

- q=2,r=-2,s=0

- q=1,r=1,s=-2? |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, sum=4

- q=1,r=-2,s=1? |1|+|-2|+|1|=1+2+1=4? s= -q-r= -1 -(-2)=1, yes

- q=0,r=2,s=-2

- q=0,r=-2,s=2

- q=-1,r=2,s=-1? | -1|+|2|+|-1|=1+2+1=4, s= -(-1)-2=1-2=-1

- q=-1,r=-1,s=2? | -1|+|-1|+|2|=1+1+2=4

- q=-2,r=1,s=1? | -2|+|1|+|1|=2+1+1=4

- q=-2,r=0,s=2

- q=-2,r=-1,s=3? | -2|+|-1|+|3|=2+1+3=6>4, not

- q=1,r=0,s=-1: sum abs 1+0+1=2<4

Earlier I have:

From above:

(2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

(1,1), (1,-2)? q=1,r=-2,s= -1 -(-2)=1? s= -q-r= -1 -(-2)= -1+2=1, yes |q|=1,|r|=2,|s|=1? |s|=|1|=1, sum=1+2+1=4, yes

But r=-2, s=1

Similarly, (0,2), (0,-2)

(-1,2), (-1,-1)? q=-1,r=-1,s= -(-1)-(-1)=1+1=2, |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, sum=4

(-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,2)? q=-2,r=2,s= -(-2)-2=2-2=0, |q|=2,|r|=2,|s|=0, sum=4

And (1,-1) is distance 1, already covered.

So all 12 positions for ring 2:

List by (q,r):

(2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

(1,1), (1,-2)? (1,-2)

(0,2), (0,-2)

(-1,2), (-1,-1)

(-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,2)

I have 11, missing one.

(1,1), (1,-2), but what about ( -1, -1) is there, (0,2), etc.

( -2,2) is there.

What about (0,0) but distance 0.

Or (1,0) distance 1.

Another one: q=0,r=0 not.

q=3,r=-3, but distance larger.

I have: from above calculation:

- (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

- (1,1), (1,-2) — but (1,-2)

- (0,2), (0,-2)

- (-1,2), (-1,-1)

- (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,2)

That's 3+2+2+2+3=12? (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) —3

(1,1),(1,-2) —2

(0,2),(0,-2) —2

(-1,2),(-1,-1) —2

(-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,2) —3, total 3+2+2+2+3=12, good.

Now in the spiral, the order is filled in some direction.

From the sequence: after cell 7 at (0,1), which is the last of ring 1.

Then ring 2 starts. Typically, it starts by moving in the direction away from center.

From 7 at (0,1), the next cell might be to (1,1) or to (-1,2), etc.

In the grid, we have cell 8 at (1,1), as per earlier snippet.

Then 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,-1), then probably 11 at (2,-2), then 12 at (1,-2), then 13 at (0,-2), then 14 at (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) is in the list, but not adjacent to previous.

After (2,-2), next might be to (1,-2), then to (0,-2), then to (-1,-2), but (-1,-2) is not in the list; q=-1,r=-2,s=3, |q|=1,|r|=2,|s|=3, sum=6>4, not distance 2.

From (0,-2), it could go to (-1,-1) or to (-1,-2), but (-1,-2) not distance 2.

The cells are connected, so after (0,-2), it might go to (-1,-1), which is adjacent? From (0,-2) to (-1,-1): dq=-1, dr=1, |dq|=1,|dr|=1, |dq+dr|=0<=1, so yes adjacent.

Similarly, then to (-2,0) or something.

Let's see the sequence from the snippet.

We have 14 at left of 4 in row 1, and 4 is at (0,-1), so probably 14 is at (-1,-1), since adjacent to 4 and to 5 at (-1,0).

And 14 is larger than 10, so in ring 2.

Also, 15 is in row 2 at left, q=-2,r=0, since left of 5 at (-1,0), so probably (-2,0).

16 in row 3, below, probably at (-2,1) or something.

In the snippet: row 3: 16,6,7,8, and 6 is at (-1,1), so 16 is left of 6, so at (-2,1).

Sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...

7 at (0,1), then 8 at (1,1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (2,-1), then 11 at (2,-2), 12 at (1,-2), 13 at (0,-2), then 14 at (-1,-1), then 15 at (-2,0), then 16 at (-2,1), then 17 at (-2,2), then 18 at (-1,2), then 19 at (0,2), then ring 2 is complete with 12 cells: 8 to 19.

In the snippet, after 16 is probably 17, but not shown, but likely.

Now, is 14 at (-1,-1)? Let's check if it fits.

From 13 at (0,-2), to 14 at (-1,-1): dq=-1, dr=1, as above, adjacent.

Then from 14 at (-1,-1) to 15 at (-2,0): dq=-1, dr=1, same vector? dq=-1, dr=1, sum dq+dr=0.

From (-1,-1) to (-2,0): dq=-1, dr=1, yes.

Then to 16 at (-2,1): from (-2,0) to (-2,1): dq=0, dr=1, adjacent.

Then to 17 at (-2,2): dq=0, dr=1, to (-2,2).

Then to 18 at (-1,2): from (-2,2) to (-1,2): dq=1, dr=0, adjacent.

Then to 19 at (0,2): dq=1, dr=0, to (0,2).

Then ring 2 complete.

In the snippet, we have 14,15,16, so yes.

Now, the spiral continues to ring 3, which has 18 cells (since 6*k for ring k, ring k has 6k cells for k>=1).

Ring 1: k=1, 6 cells.

Ring 2: k=2, 12 cells.

Ring 3: k=3, 18 cells, numbers 20 to 37.

But we don't need that yet.

Now, I need to find where 2026 is.

First, find which ring it is in.

The rings: ring 0: n=1

Ring 1: n=2 to 7, 6 cells

Ring 2: n=8 to 19, 12 cells

Ring 3: n=20 to 37? 20 to 20+18-1=37, yes.

Ring k for k>=1 has 6k cells, starting from n_k = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 6i = 1 + 6*(k-1)k/2 = 1 + 3k(k-1)

Sum from i=1 to m of 6i = 6*m(m+1)/2 = 3m(m+1)

So the last number in ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Sum from i=1 to k of 6i = 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 3k(k+1)

So last number of ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1)

Ring k starts at n_{start}(k) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 6i = 1 + 3(k-1)k

And ends at n_{end}(k) = n_{start}(k) + 6k - 1 = 1 + 3k(k-1) + 6k - 1 = 3k^2 - 3k + 6k = 3k^2 + 3k = 3k(k+1)

As above.

So n_end(k) = 3k(k+1)

Now, find k such that n_end(k) >= 2026.

Solve 3k(k+1) >= 2026

k(k+1) >= 2026/3 ≈ 675.333

k^2 ≈ 675, k≈26, since 26^2=676.

26*27=702, 3*702=2106 >=2026

25*26=650, 3*650=1950 <2026

So ring k=26 ends at 3*26*27=3*702=2106

Ring k=25 ends at 3*25*26=3*650=1950

So 1950 < 2026 <= 2106, so 2026 is in ring k=26.

Start of ring k=26: n_start = 1 + 3*(k-1)k = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650=1+1950=1951

End: 1951 + 6*26 - 1 = 1951 + 156 -1 = 2106, yes.

So numbers from 1951 to 2106 are in ring 26.

Now, I need to find the position of 2026 in this ring.

The ring has 6k = 6*26=156 cells.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells? For a hexagonal ring, each side has k cells, since ring k has 6k cells, so each side has exactly k cells.

In ring k, starting from a certain point.

Typically, the spiral starts at the center, then moves out in a direction, say east.

Then for each ring, it starts at the cell adjacent to the start of previous ring.

In this case, for ring k, it starts at the cell that is in the direction of the "first" direction from the center.

From the earlier pattern:

For ring 1: started at (1,0) with n=2.

Ring 2: started at (1,1) with n=8? But (1,1) is southeast or something.

From center, the start of ring k is at (k,0) or something.

For ring 1: cells include (1,0), which is east.

Ring 2: started at (1,1), which is southeast? From center, but not directly.

The starting point of ring k is at (k,0) in axial coordinates? For k=1: (1,0), yes n=2.

For k=2: should be (2,0)? But ring 2 started at (1,1) with n=8, but (2,0) is n=9? Not the same.

In ring 2, first cell is (1,1) at n=8, while (2,0) is n=9.

So not.

The direction: in ring k, it starts at the cell that is k steps east? But for k=2, it started at (1,1), not (2,0).

Notice that from the end of previous ring, it moves to the start of next ring.

End of ring k-1 is at some point, then it moves to the start of ring k.

For example, end of ring 1: last cell is n=7 at (0,1)

Then it moves to n=8 at (1,1), which is adjacent: from (0,1) to (1,1): dq=1, dr=0, so east.

Similarly, end of ring 2: last cell is n=19 at (0,2)? Earlier we had ring 2 ends at (0,2) with n=19.

Then moves to start of ring 3: probably to (1,2) or something.

Ring 3: distance 3, cells from n=20 to 37.

Start: after 19 at (0,2), move east to (1,2)? Then n=20 at (1,2).

Then continue.

In general, the start of ring k is at (k,1-k) or something? For k=1: (1,0)? But we have (1,0) for n=2.

But for k=2, start is (1,1), which is not (2,-1) or something.

Note that the starting point for ring k is at (k,0) only for k=1.

Perhaps in the direction perpendicular.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the starting point of ring k is at (k,0) in cube coordinates, but let's compute.

Set the starting point of ring k as S_k.

S_k has coordinates.

From pattern: k=1: S1 = (1,0) in (q,r)

k=2: S2 = (1,1)

k=3: S3 = (1,2)? Assuming after 19 at (0,2), move to (1,2) for n=20.

Then ring 3: from (1,2), probably move northeast to (2,1) or something.

But let's list the direction of traversal.

In ring k, it traverses in a certain order: typically, it goes along a direction, then turns, etc.

From earlier ring 2: started at (1,1), then moved east? To (2,1)? But in our case, it went to (2,0)? From (1,1) to (2,0), which is northeast (dq=1,dr=-1)

Then to (2,-1), east? dq=0,dr=-1? From (2,0) to (2,-1): same q, r decreases, which is north? In our coordinate, r increases downward? Earlier we set r=0 for center, r=-1 above, r=1 below, so r increases downward, so decreasing r is upward.

From (2,0) to (2,-1): dq=0, dr=-1, so north.

Then to (2,-2): north again.

Then to (1,-2): southwest? dq=-1, dr=0? West.

From (2,-2) to (1,-2): dq=-1, dr=0, west.

Then to (0,-2): west.

Then to (-1,-1): northwest? dq=-1, dr=1, since from (0,-2) to (-1,-1): dq=-1, dr=1.

Then to (-2,0): northwest? dq=-1, dr=1? From (-1,-1) to (-2,0): dq=-1, dr=1, same vector.

Then to (-2,1): south? dq=0, dr=1? Down.

From (-2,0) to (-2,1): dq=0, dr=1, down.

Then to (-2,2): down.

Then to (-1,2): east? dq=1, dr=0? From (-2,2) to (-1,2): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Then to (0,2): east.

Then ring complete.

So the directions: start at (1,1), move northeast to (2,0)? But (1,1) to (2,0) is dq=1,dr=-1.

Then move north to (2,-1), (2,-2): dr=-1 each time.

Then move west to (1,-2), (0,-2): dq=-1.

Then move northwest to (-1,-1), (-2,0): dq=-1,dr=1.

Then move south to (-2,1), (-2,2): dr=1.

Then move east to (-1,2), (0,2): dq=1.

Each "side" has k=2 cells, and direction changes after k cells.

In this case, for ring k=2, each side has 2 cells.

The directions in order: first direction: from start, move in direction dq=1,dr=-1 (northeast)

But moved only one step? From (1,1) to (2,0), that's one step, but k=2, should have two cells? The cells are traversed, but the side has cells, but the movement is between cells.

In ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells.

The starting cell is the first cell of the first side.

Then it moves along the side.

For ring k=2:

- Side 1: cells: (1,1) and (2,0)? But (1,1) is start, then next is (2,0), so two cells: n=8 and n=9? But n=8 at (1,1), n=9 at (2,0).

But earlier I thought n=9 is at (2,0), but in sequence n=8 at (1,1), n=9 at (2,0).

Then next side: from (2,0) to (2,-1) and (2,-2)? n=10 at (2,-1), n=11 at (2,-2).

So side 2: (2,0) and (2,-2)? But (2,-1) is between.

Cells: after (2,0), it moves to (2,-1), then to (2,-2), so two cells: n=10 and n=11? But n=9 is at (2,0), n=10 at (2,-1), n=11 at (2,-2).

So for side 2: cells (2,-1) and (2,-2)? But (2,0) is end of previous side.

Actually, each side consists of k cells, but the direction is constant for the side.

In side 1: from (1,1) to (2,0): but the direction is not constant; from (1,1) to next cell (2,0), vector (1,-1), but then if it were to continue, but it doesn't; after (2,0), it moves to (2,-1), vector (0,-1), different direction.

So the side is defined by the direction of movement.

In this case, for ring k, the movement directions are fixed in order.

From the path:

After start, it moves in direction: for ring 2: from S2=(1,1) to next cell: to (2,0), vector (1,-1)

Then after that, it moves north: to (2,-1), vector (0,-1)

But each move is to the next cell, and for each segment, it moves k steps? But here it moved only one step per direction change, but k=2, should move multiple steps.

I think I miscounted.

In ring 2, from n=8 at (1,1), move to n=9 at (2,0) — one move.

Then from n=9 at (2,0) move to n=10 at (2,-1) — second move, but same direction? From (2,0) to (2,-1) is vector (0,-1), while from (1,1) to (2,0) is (1,-1), different.

But in the sequence, after (2,0), it went to (2,-1), which is north, not continuing northeast.

But for k=2, it should have two cells per side? But here from start to end of first side: only one cell moved? The first side includes cells n=8 and n=9? Two cells: (1,1) and (2,0).

But the direction between them is not constant; the cells are not aligned in a straight line in hex grid.

In hex grid, a "side" may not be a straight line, but in terms of the grid, the cells on a side of the hexagon are not necessarily in a straight line if the hex is not aligned, but in this case, for a hexagonal ring, the cells on one side are collinear in the grid.

For example, in ring 2, the "east" side might be cells with max q, which are (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2)? But in our list, (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) are three cells, but k=2, should be two.

For ring k, the side length is k cells, but the cells are at corners as well.

Typically, for a hexagonal spiral, each side of the ring has k cells, including the corner cells, but corner cells are shared.

In ring k, there are 6 corners, and between corners, there are k-1 cells, but total cells 6k, so if 6 corners, and 6*(k-1) edge cells, total 6k, yes.

For example, ring 2: k=2, so each side has 1 edge cell between corners? Total cells: 6 corners and 6*1=6 edge cells? But 6+6=12, but corners are included, so it's 6 corners and the cells between are not additional; actually, each side has k cells, which include the two corners and k-2 cells in between, but for k=2, each side has 2 cells, which are the two corners for that side.

For example, in ring 2, the six corners are at (2,0), (2,-2), (0,-2), (-2,0), (-2,2), (0,2)? But in our list, (2,0),(2,-2),(0,-2),(-2,0),(-2,2),(0,2) are all present, and also (2,-1), (1,-2), (-1,-1), (-2,1), (-1,2), (1,1) — the other six.

But in the traversal, it visits all, but the corners are visited at turns.

In the sequence for ring 2: cells in order: (1,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-1), (-2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2), (-1,2), (0,2)

The corners: (2,0) is a corner? But it's visited second, then (2,-2) fourth, (0,-2) sixth, etc.

The actual corner cells might be those with max |q| or |r|, but in this case, the turns are at (2,0), (2,-2), (0,-2), (-2,0), (-2,2), (0,2), and (1,1) is not a corner, it's an edge cell.

For ring k, the corners are at (k,0), (k,-k), (0,-k), (-k,0), (-k,k), (0,k) in axial coordinates? For k=2: (2,0), (2,-2), (0,-2), (-2,0), (-2,2), (0,2) — yes, these are the six corners.

Then the other cells are on the sides: for example, between (2,0) and (2,-2): cells like (2,-1)

Between (2,-2) and (0,-2): cells like (1,-2)

 Etc.

In the spiral path, for ring k, it starts at a non-corner cell. For k=2, started at (1,1), which is on the side between (0,2) and (2,0)? The side from (0,2) to (2,0) might be cells with q+r=k or something.

For the side from (0,k) to (k,0), the cells have r = k - q, for q=0 to k.

For example, k=2: q from 0 to 2, r=2-q: q=0,r=2; q=1,r=1; q=2,r=0. So cells (0,2),(1,1),(2,0)

Yes, so for side between corner (0,k) and (k,0), cells are (q, k-q) for q=0 to k.

Similarly for other sides.

In the spiral, it traverses each side in order.

For ring k, it starts at the cell adjacent to the end of previous ring.

End of ring k-1 is at (0,k-1) or something? For k=2, end of ring 1 is at (0,1), which is a corner.

Then start of ring 2 is at (1,1), which is the next cell on the side from (0,1) to (2,0)? But for ring 2, side from (0,2) to (2,0), but (0,1) is not on it.

The side it starts on is the one in the direction it was moving.

At the end of ring k-1, it is at a corner, say (0,k-1), and it was moving east or something.

For ring 1: ended at (0,1), and before that was from (-1,1) to (0,1), vector (1,0), east.

Then it moves to start of ring 2: to (1,1), vector (1,0)? From (0,1) to (1,1), dq=1,dr=0, east.

But (1,1) is not on the same "row"; in terms of direction, it moved east to (1,1).

Then for ring 2, it moves along the side. The side it is on is from (0,2) to (2,0), but it's at (1,1), so it can move towards (2,0) or towards (0,2).

In this case, it moved to (2,0), which is northeast.

The direction: from (1,1) to (2,0): vector (1,-1), which is northeast.

Then after reaching (2,0), it turns to the next direction: north, to (2,-1), vector (0,-1).

And so on.

The sequence of directions for each side:

For each side, there is a constant direction vector for moving to the next cell.

For side 1: from start to first corner. For ring k, start at S_k, then move to C1, then to C2, etc.

In this case for ring k, it visits the cells in order along the sides.

For a given side, the direction is constant.

For example, in ring 2, side 1: cells (1,1) and (2,0). From (1,1) to (2,0): vector (1,-1)

Side 2: cells (2,-1) and (2,-2)? But (2,0) is corner, then next is (2,-1), vector (0,-1), then to (2,-2), same vector.

But (2,-1) and (2,-2) are two cells, with vector (0,-1) between them.

Then side 3: from (2,-2) to (1,-2)? Vector (-1,0)? Then to (0,-2), same vector.

Side 4: from (0,-2) to (-1,-1), vector (-1,1)

Then to (-2,0), same vector.

Side 5: from (-2,0) to (-2,1), vector (0,1)

To (-2,2), same.

Side 6: from (-2,2) to (-1,2), vector (1,0)

To (0,2), same.

Then back to start, but it stops.

So each side has a constant direction vector for the moves within the side.

The number of moves per side is k, but since it moves from one cell to the next, for a side with m cells, there are m-1 moves, but here each side has k cells, so k-1 moves? But in this case for k=2, each side has 2 cells, so one move per side, but the direction is constant for that segment.

In general, for a side, there are k cells, and the direction vector is constant between consecutive cells on that side.

The direction vectors for the six sides are fixed: let's list them.

From above for ring 2:

Side 1: vector (1,-1)  // northeast

Side 2: vector (0,-1)  // north

Side 3: vector (-1,0)  // west

Side 4: vector (-1,1)  // northwest

Side 5: vector (0,1)   // south

Side 6: vector (1,0)   // east

Note that these vectors are the same as the neighbor vectors but scaled? Actually, each is one of the six possible neighbor vectors.

Specifically: (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,0)

But missing (1,0) is there, but (1,0) is east, (0,1) is south, etc.

The six directions: east (1,0), southeast? But in our list, we have (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)

(1,-1) is northeast, (-1,1) is northwest.

The standard neighbor vectors are: (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) — exactly these six.

In order: for the spiral, the directions are cycled in this order: (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,0)

For ring 2.

Now for ring 1: ring 1 has 6 cells, but since k=1, each side has one cell? But corners only.

In ring 1: cells: (1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1)

Traversed in order: 2:(1,0),3:(1,-1),4:(0,-1),5:(-1,0),6:(-1,1),7:(0,1)

Vectors: from (1,0) to (1,-1): (0,-1) north

To (0,-1): (-1,0) west? From (1,-1) to (0,-1): dq=-1,dr=0, west.

To (-1,0): from (0,-1) to (-1,0): dq=-1,dr=1? Vector (-1,1) northwest.

To (-1,1): from (-1,0) to (-1,1): (0,1) south.

To (0,1): from (-1,1) to (0,1): (1,0) east.

But it started at (1,0), so the moves are: after placing (1,0), move to (1,-1) with (0,-1), then to (0,-1) with (-1,0)? From (1,-1) to (0,-1): dq=-1,dr=0, west.

Then to (-1,0): dq=-1,dr=1? From (0,-1) to (-1,0): dq=-1, dr=1, vector (-1,1)

Then to (-1,1): dq=0,dr=1, (0,1)

Then to (0,1): dq=1,dr=0, (1,0)

So directions: (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,0)

But it started with moving from center to (1,0), but for the ring itself, the first move is from (1,0) to (1,-1).

The sequence of direction vectors for the moves in ring k is the same for all k: it cycles through the six directions in order: let's see the sequence.

For ring 1: moves: to next cell: from 2 to 3: (0,-1)

3 to 4: (-1,0)

4 to 5: (-1,1)? From (0,-1) to (-1,0): dq=-1, dr=1, yes (-1,1)

5 to 6: (0,1) from (-1,0) to (-1,1)

6 to 7: (1,0) from (-1,1) to (0,1)

So directions: (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,0)

But there are only 5 moves for 6 cells? Since 6 cells, 5 moves, but ring has 6k cells, so 6k-1 moves.

For k=1, 5 moves, directions as above: north, west, northwest, south, east.

But missing one direction? The six possible are: east(1,0), northeast(1,-1), north(0,-1), west(-1,0), northwest(-1,1), south(0,1)

In the sequence: north(0,-1), west(-1,0), northwest(-1,1), south(0,1), east(1,0)

Missing northeast(1,-1).

But in ring 2, it started with northeast.

The first move of the ring depends on the starting point.

For ring k, the starting cell S_k, and the first move direction.

From earlier, for ring k, S_k is at (k,1-k) or something? For k=1: S1=(1,0)

k=2: S2=(1,1)

k=3: S3=(1,2)? 

Notice that S_k has q=k, r=1-k? For k=1: q=1,r=0? 1-1=0, yes (1,0)

k=2: q=2,r=1-2=-1? But we have (1,1), not (2,-1)

Perhaps (k-1,k-1) or something.

k=1: (0,0) but not.

From end of previous ring: for ring k-1, ends at (0,k-1)

Then moves to S_k = (1,k-1) ? For k=2: from (0,1) to (1,1), yes.

For k=3: end of ring 2 at (0,2), move to (1,2) for S3.

Then first move: from (1,2) to next cell. In ring 3, probably move northeast to (2,1) or something.

Generally, from S_k = (1,k-1) ? For k=2: (1,1), k=3: (1,2)

Then first direction: to (2,k-2)? For k=2: to (2,0), which is (2,1-1)? r=0, k-2=0, yes (2,0)

For k=3: to (2,1)? Since k-2=1, so (2,1)

Vector from S_k to next: from (1,k-1) to (2,k-2): dq=1, dr= (k-2)-(k-1) = -1, so (1,-1), northeast.

Same as ring 2.

Then after that, it moves in the same sequence of directions as ring 1 and 2.

For ring k, after the first move, it follows the same direction sequence: north, west, northwest, south, east, but then back to northeast? But after east, it should go to the next side.

In ring 2, after first move to (2,0), then moved north to (2,-1), which is direction (0,-1)

Then west to (1,-2)? From (2,-2) to (1,-2): (-1,0)

Then northwest to (-1,-1)? From (0,-2) to (-1,-1): (-1,1)

Then south to (-2,1)? From (-2,0) to (-2,1): (0,1)

Then east to (-1,2)? From (-2,2) to (-1,2): (1,0)

Then to (0,2), same direction.

Now, after that, it would go to next, but ring ends.

The sequence of directions for the moves: first move: (1,-1) northeast

Then next moves: (0,-1) north, (-1,0) west, (-1,1) northwest, (0,1) south, (1,0) east

Then for the next side, it would repeat, but since each side has k cells, and k moves? For a side with m cells, there are m-1 moves.

In ring k, each side has k cells, so k-1 moves per side.

In the sequence above, for each side, the direction is constant, but in the list, for side 1: only one move? For k=2, side 1 has two cells, one move: from S_k to C1 with vector (1,-1)

Then side 2: from C1 to next cell, but in side 2, cells are C1 and the next corner? In ring k, the corners are visited, and between corners there are k-1 cells? Total cells per side is k, including the two corners? No.

As earlier, for a side, there are k cells. For example, side from corner A to corner B, with k cells including A and B.

The direction from A to B is constant, and cells are equally spaced.

In axial coordinates, for side from (0,k) to (k,0), cells (q,k-q) for q=0 to k, vector from one to next is (1,-1) if moving from q to q+1.

Similarly for other sides.

In the spiral traversal, for ring k, it starts not at a corner, but at a cell on the side.

Specifically, for the first side, from corner (0,k) to (k,0), it starts at (1,k-1)? For k=2: (1,1), which is q=1,r=1, k-q=2-1=1, yes r=k-q? For side from (0,k) to (k,0), r = k - q.

So for q from 0 to k, r=k-q.

Cell at (q, k-q)

For k=2: q=0,r=2; q=1,r=1; q=2,r=0.

Start at (1,1), which is q=1,r=1.

Then it moves towards (k,0) = (2,0), so increasing q, decreasing r, vector (1,-1)

After reaching (2,0), it moves to the next side.

The next side is from (k,0) to (k,-k)? For k=2, from (2,0) to (2,-2)

Cells: for this side, q=k, r from 0 to -k.

So r decreasing, q constant.

Cells (k,r) for r=0,-1,-2,...,-k

For k=2: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2)

But in traversal, it was at (2,0), then to (2,-1), then to (2,-2)

Vector from (2,0) to (2,-1): (0,-1), then to (2,-2): (0,-1), same.

Then from (2,-2) to next side: to (1,-2)? But (1,-2) is on the next side.

Next side from (2,-2) to (0,-k) = (0,-2)

Cells with q + r = k - k? For this side, from (k,-k) to (0,-k), so r= -k, q from k to 0.

Cells (q, -k) for q=k,k-1,...,0

For k=2: (2,-2),(1,-2),(0,-2)

Vector from (2,-2) to (1,-2): (-1,0), to (0,-2): (-1,0)

Then from (0,-2) to next side: to (-1,-1)

Next side from (0,-k) to (-k,0) = (-2,0)

Cells with ? From (0,-2) to (-2,0), so q from 0 to -2, r from -2 to 0, with r = q - something.

The line: when moving from (0,-k) to (-k,0), the vector per step is (-1,1), since dq=-1, dr=1.

Cells: (q, q - k) or something. For k=2: (0,-2), (-1,-1), (-2,0)

r = q - k? For q=0,r=-2=0-2; q=-1,r=-1=-1-2? -3 no.

q + r = -k? For (0,-2):0-2=-2; (-1,-1):-1-1=-2; (-2,0):-2+0=-2, yes.

So cells with q + r = -k.

Vector (-1,1)

Then from (-2,0) to next side: to (-2,1)

Side from (-k,0) to (-k,k) = (-2,2)

Cells (-k,r) for r=0 to k, so q=-k, r increasing.

Vector (0,1)

Cells (-2,0),(-2,1),(-2,2)

Then from (-2,2) to next: to (-1,2)

Side from (-k,k) to (0,k) = (-2,2) to (0,2)

Cells (q,k) for q=-k to 0, so r=k, q increasing.

Vector (1,0)

Cells (-2,2),(-1,2),(0,2)

Then from (0,2) back to start, but it ends.

In the spiral, after (0,2), it would go to the start of next ring, but for this ring, it stops at the last corner.

In our case for ring 2, it ended at (0,2), which is a corner.

Now, the start was at (1,1), not a corner.

For ring k, it starts at (1,k-1) for the first side.

The first side has cells from (0,k) to (k,0), but it starts at (1,k-1), which is not an endpoint.

Specifically, for the first side, cells: (q, k-q) for q=0 to k, but it starts at q=1, r=k-1.

Then moves to q=k, r=0, with vector (1,-1), so it moves k-1 steps? From q=1 to q=k, delta q=k-1, each step dq=1,dr=-1, so number of moves: k-1? But number of cells from start to corner is k-1 cells? From q=1 to q=k, inclusive, that's k cells: q=1,2,...,k, with r=k-q.

For example k=2: q=1,r=1; q=2,r=0. So two cells, one move.

In general, from start S_k = (1,k-1) to corner C1 = (k,0), there are k-1 moves? But for k=2, one move, which is k-1=1.

Number of cells in this segment: from (1,k-1) to (k,0), with steps (1,-1), so after m moves, at (1+m, k-1 - m)

Set equal to (k,0): 1+m=k, k-1-m=0, so m=k-1, and r= k-1 - (k-1) =0, yes.

So after m=k-1 moves, at (k,0), and number of cells visited: from start to end, inclusive, is (k-1) +1 = k cells? The cells are: start at (1,k-1), after first move to (2,k-2), ..., after (k-1)th move to (k,0). So the cells are (1,k-1), (2,k-2), ..., (k,0). That's k cells: for i=1 to k, (i, k-i)

But for k=2: (1,1),(2,0) yes.

But earlier I said the side has cells (q,k-q) for q=0 to k, which includes (0,k) and (k,0), but here we start at (1,k-1), not at (0,k).

So for the first side, in the spiral, it visits only from (1,k-1) to (k,0), k cells, missing (0,k).

Then at (k,0), it moves to the next side, which is from (k,0) to (k,-k), but starts at (k,0), then to (k,-1), etc.

Cells for second side: (k,r) for r=0,-1,-2,...,-k

But it starts at r=0, ends at r=-k.

So cells (k,0), (k,-1), ..., (k,-k). That's k+1 cells? r from 0 to -k, inclusive, so r=0,-1,-2,...,-k, which is k+1 values.

But for k=2: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) — three cells, but k=2, should be k cells per side? Contradiction.

Problem.

In ring k, total cells 6k, and 6 sides, each should have k cells.

But for side 2, if it has cells from (k,0) to (k,-k), that's |0 - (-k)| +1 = k+1 cells, too many.

Perhaps it starts from (k,-1) or something.

In the traversal for ring 2: at (2,0), then to (2,-1), then to (2,-2), so cells (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) — three cells for k=2.

But 3 >2, and total would be more than 12.

But earlier we have only 12 cells, and in the list, (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) are all in, but for side 2, if it includes only two cells, but here it has three.

Perhaps the side includes only the cells between, but no.

For ring k, the side from corner (k,0) to corner (k,-k), the cells are (k,r) for r=0 down to r= -k, but since corners are shared, each corner is shared by two sides, so each side has k cells including the starting corner but not the ending corner, or vice versa.

In standard, for a hexagonal ring, each side has k cells, and the corners are included in the sides, but each corner is the end of one side and start of the next.

In the sequence, when it reaches a corner, it is the end of one side and start of the next.

For ring k, the corners are at (k,0), (k,-k), (0,-k), (-k,0), (-k,k), (0,k)

For side 1: from (0,k) to (k,0) — cells in between: but including both? Then for k=2, cells (0,2),(1,1),(2,0) — three cells, but k=2, should be 2 cells? 3>2.

Unless for side 1, it starts after (0,k), but in spiral, it starts at (1,k-1), not at (0,k).

Perhaps in the spiral path, it does not include the corner (0,k) in this ring; it was included in previous ring.

For example, in ring 2, the cell (0,2) is included, at the end.

But (0,2) is a corner for ring 2.

And it is visited at the end.

The cell (0,k) is the last cell of the ring.

For the first side, it starts at (1,k-1), ends at (k,0)

Then second side: starts at (k,0), ends at (k,-k)

Then third side: starts at (k,-k), ends at (0,-k)

Fourth side: starts at (0,-k), ends at (-k,0)

Fifth side: starts at (-k,0), ends at (-k,k)

Sixth side: starts at (-k,k), ends at (0,k)

And (0,k) is the last cell.

Now, for each side, the number of cells from start to end inclusive.

For side 1: from (1,k-1) to (k,0)

As above, cells (i, k-i) for i=1 to k

Number of cells: i=1,2,...,k, so k cells.

For k=2: (1,1),(2,0) —2 cells.

Side 2: from (k,0) to (k,-k)

Cells (k,r) for r=0,-1,-2,...,-k

r from 0 to -k, step -1, so r=0,-1,-2,...,-k, which is k+1 values: 0 to -k inclusive is |0-(-k)|+1=k+1 cells.

But for k=2: r=0,-1,-2, three cells, but should be k=2 cells.

Mistake.

For side 2, it should be from (k,0) to (k,-k), but only the cells in between, but then only if k>1, but for k=2, from (2,0) to (2,-2), if only (2,-1), then one cell, but k=2, should be 2 cells.

Perhaps it includes (k,0) and (k,-k), but then only two cells for k=2, but then the cells in between are missing.

In the path, for side 2, it includes (k,0), (k,-1), ..., (k,-k), which is k+1 cells for the side, but that can't be.

For ring 2, side 2: cells (2,0),(2,-1),(2,-2) — three cells, but the side should have only 2 cells since total 12/6=2.

But 3>2, and in the list, these are all distinct cells, but for the ring, all are included, but if each side has 3 cells, total 18, too many.

I think I have a confusion.

In ring k, there are 6k cells. The 6 corners are part of it, and between each pair of adjacent corners, there are k-1 additional cells, so total cells = 6 corners + 6*(k-1) = 6k, yes.

For k=2, 6 corners + 6*1 = 6+6=12 cells.

The additional cells are on the sides, not at corners.

For example, between (2,0) and (2,-2), there is (2,-1)

Between (2,-2) and (0,-2), there is (1,-2)

 etc.

In the spiral path, it visits the cells in order, and at the corners, it turns.

For ring k, it starts at a non-corner cell on the first side.

For example, ring 2: starts at (1,1), which is not a corner; corners are (2,0),(2,-2), etc.

Then moves to (2,0) (corner), then to (2,-1) (non-corner), then to (2,-2) (corner), then to (1,-2) (non-corner), then to (0,-2) (corner), and so on.

So the path is: non-corner, corner, non-corner, corner, etc.

For ring k, since there are 6k cells, and 6 corners, so 6k - 6 non-corners, but for k=2, 12-6=6 non-corners, which matches.

The start is a non-corner cell.

Then it moves to the next corner, then to the next non-corner, and so on.

The distance between start and first corner is 1 move, then from there to next non-corner is 1 move, and so on.

For each "segment" between a non-corner and a corner, or corner to non-corner, it's one move.

But for the entire ring, there are 6k cells, so 6k-1 moves.

The moves are between cells, and each move is to an adjacent cell in the ring.

To find the position of a number, I need to know the ring and the index within the ring.

For ring k, there are 6k cells, indexed from 0 to 6k-1.

The start cell is cell 0: S_k = (1,k-1) in (q,r)

Then cell 1: the first corner C1 = (k,0)

Then cell 2: next non-corner, which is on the second side.

From C1 = (k,0), it moves in the next direction, which is (0,-1) north, to (k,-1)

For k=2: from (2,0) to (2,-1)

So cell 2: (k,-1)

Then cell 3: next corner C2 = (k,-k)

For k=2: (2,-2)

Then cell 4: next non-corner, move in next direction (-1,0) west, to (k-1,-k)

For k=2: (1,-2)

Then cell 5: corner C3 = (0,-k) = (0,-2)

Then cell 6: non-corner, move in next direction (-1,1) northwest, to (-1,-k+1)? From (0,-2) to (-1,-1) for k=2, vector (-1,1), so ( -1, -2 +1) = (-1,-1)

General: from C3 = (0,-k) to cell 6: ( -1, -k +1)

Then cell 7: corner C4 = (-k,0)

From ( -1, -k+1) to (-k,0): vector (-1,1)? dq= -1, dr=1, yes, same direction.

For cell 6 to C4: from ( -1, -k+1) to (-k,0): dq= -1, dr= - (-k+1) +0? r from -k+1 to 0, dr = 0 - (-k+1) = k-1, not 1.

For k=2: from (-1,-1) to (-2,0): dq= -1, dr=1, yes ( -1,1)

And distance: |dq|=1, |dr|=1, |dq+dr|=0, adjacent, good.

Then cell 8: non-corner, move south (0,1) to (-k,1)

For k=2: (-2,1)

Then cell 9: corner C5 = (-k,k) = (-2,2)

Then cell 10: non-corner, move east (1,0) to (-k+1,k) = (-1,2)

Then cell 11: corner C6 = (0,k) = (0,2)

Then ring ends.

For general k, the cells are:

Cell 0: S_k = (1,k-1)

Cell 1: C1 = (k,0)

Cell 2: P2 = (k,-1)

Cell 3: C2 = (k,-k)

Cell 4: P3 = (k-1,-k)

Cell 5: C3 = (0,-k)

Cell 6: P4 = (-1,-k+1)  // since from (0,-k) move (-1,1) to (-1,-k+1)

Cell 7: C4 = (-k,0)

Cell 8: P5 = (-k,1)  // move (0,1) from C4

Cell 9: C5 = (-k,k)

Cell 10: P6 = (-k+1,k)  // move (1,0) from C5 to (-k+1,k)

Cell 11: C6 = (0,k)

Then for k>2, it continues, but in this sequence, for k=2, cells up to cell 11, which is 12 cells, good.

But for k>2, there are more cells on each side.

For example, for k=3, ring 3, should have 18 cells.

Start cell 0: S3 = (1,3-1)=(1,2)

Cell 1: C1 = (3,0)

Then cell 2: should be P2 = (3,-1)  // move north from C1

But then cell 3: not yet C2, because there should be more cells on the side.

After cell 2 at (3,-1), it should move further north to (3,-2), then to C2=(3,-3)

So for cell 3: (3,-2)

Cell 4: C2=(3,-3)

Then cell 5: P3 = (2,-3)  // move west from C2 to (k-1,-k)=(2,-3)

Cell 6: then to (1,-3)? Since move west again, to (1,-3)

Cell 7: C3=(0,-3)

And so on.

So general pattern: for each side, after the start, it moves in the direction for that side for k-1 steps to the corner, but since it starts at a non-corner, and ends at corner, and there are k cells in between including both, so it moves k-1 times in that direction.

For the first side: from cell 0: (1,k-1) to cell 1: (k,0), with vector (1,-1), and it moves k-1 times? For k=2: one move, cells: cell0, cell1.

For k=3: cells: cell0: (1,2), then move to cell1: (2,1)? No, should be to (3,0), but from (1,2) to (3,0) is not adjacent; must go through intermediate cells.

From (1,2) to (2,1) to (3,0), with vector (1,-1) each move.

So cell0: (1,2)

Cell1: (2,1)  // after first move

Cell2: (3,0)  // after second move

So for k=3, two moves, cells 0,1,2 on first side.

Number of cells on first side: k=3 cells: (1,2),(2,1),(3,0)

Then at cell2: C1=(3,0)

Then next side: second side, direction north (0,-1)

From (3,0) to (3,-1), then to (3,-2), then to (3,-3) = C2

So cell3: (3,-1)

Cell4: (3,-2)

Cell5: (3,-3) = C2

Then third side: direction west (-1,0)

From (3,-3) to (2,-3), then to (1,-3), then to (0,-3) = C3

Cell6: (2,-3)

Cell7: (1,-3)

Cell8: (0,-3) = C3

Then fourth side: direction northwest (-1,1)

From (0,-3) to (-1,-2), then to (-2,-1), then to (-3,0) = C4

Cell9: (-1,-2)

Cell10: (-2,-1)

Cell11: (-3,0) = C4

Then fifth side: south (0,1)

From (-3,0) to (-3,1), to (-3,2), to (-3,3) = C5

Cell12: (-3,1)

Cell13: (-3,2)

Cell14: (-3,3) = C5

Then sixth side: east (1,0)

From (-3,3) to (-2,3), to (-1,3), to (0,3) = C6

Cell15: (-2,3)

Cell16: (-1,3)

Cell17: (0,3) = C6

Then ring complete, 18 cells.

Perfect.

So general for ring k:

- Start at cell 0: (1, k-1)

- First side (direction (1,-1)): cells for i=0 to k-1: (1+i, k-1 - i) = (1+i, (k-1)-i)

Since r = (k-1) - i

At i=0: (1,k-1)

i=1: (2,k-2)

...

i=k-1: (k,0) which is cell number i in this side? Cell index: from 0 to k-1, so cells 0 to k-1 on this side.

Cell m for m=0 to k-1: (1+m, k-1 - m)

- Then at cell k-1: (k,0) = C1

- Second side (direction (0,-1)): from here, move north.

Cells: for j=0 to k-1: (k, 0 - j) = (k, -j)

But j from 0: (k,0), but this is already cell k-1, so for the new cells, j=1 to k-1: cell index from k to k + (k-2)? Better to continue the index.

After cell k-1: (k,0)

Then cell k: (k,-1)

Cell k+1: (k,-2)

...

Cell k+(k-1) -1? From cell k to cell k + (k-1) -1? Number of new cells: from (k,-1) to (k,-k), which is k cells: r= -1,-2,...,-k

But (k,0) is already included, so new cells are (k,-1),(k,-2),...,(k,-k), which is k cells? r from -1 to -k, inclusive, that's k values? -1,-2,...,-k, number is k.

But the corner C2 = (k,-k) is included.

So cells for second side: cell m for m=k to 2k-1: (k, -(m - k) -1 ? When m=k: (k,-1)

m=k+1: (k,-2)

...

m=k+(k-1) = 2k-1: (k,-k)

So cell m: (k, - (m - k + 1) ) ? For m=k: - (k - k +1) = -1, yes

m=2k-1: - (2k-1 - k +1) = - (k) , yes.

Since r = - (m - k + 1)

Or r = k - m - 1? For m=k: k-k-1=-1, yes; m=2k-1: k-(2k-1)-1= k-2k+1-1= -k, yes.

- Then at cell 2k-1: (k,-k) = C2

- Third side (direction (-1,0)): move west.

Cells: from (k,-k) to (0,-k)

So q from k down to 0, r= -k

Cells: (q, -k) for q=k-1, k-2, ..., 0

But q=k is already at cell 2k-1, so new cells q=k-1 down to 0.

Number: from q=k-1 to 0, inclusive, that's k cells? q=k-1,k-2,...,0, number is k.

Cell index: from 2k to 3k-1

Cell m: for m=2k to 3k-1: q = 3k-1 - m ? When m=2k: q=k-1

m=2k+1: q=k-2

...

m=3k-1: q=0

So q = 3k-1 - m

r = -k

- Then cell 3k-1: (0,-k) = C3

- Fourth side (direction (-1,1)): move northwest.

From (0,-k) to (-k,0)

Cells on the line q + r = -k

From (0,-k) to (-k,0), with vector (-1,1)

Cells: after (0,-k), next is (-1,-k+1), then (-2,-k+2), ..., to (-k,0)

General cell: (q, r) with r = -k - q, and q from -1 down to -k

At q=0: (0,-k) already

q=-1: (-1,-k+1)? r= -k - (-1) = -k+1

q=-2: r= -k - (-2) = -k+2

...

q=-k: r= -k - (-k) =0

So cells: q= -1,-2,...,-k

r= -k - q

Number of cells: k cells (from -1 to -k)

Cell index: from 3k to 4k-1

Cell m: q = -(m - 3k + 1) ? When m=3k: q=-1

m=3k+1: q=-2

...

m=4k-1: q= -k

r = -k - q

- Then cell 4k-1: (-k,0) = C4

- Fifth side (direction (0,1)): move south.

From (-k,0) to (-k,k)

Cells: r from 1 to k, q= -k

So cell m: for m=4k to 5k-1: q= -k, r= m - 4k ? When m=4k: r=0? But already at r=0, so r from 1 to k.

m=4k: r=1

m=4k+1: r=2

...

m=5k-1: r=k

So r = m - 4k + 0? m=4k: r=1? Set r = m - 4k

m=4k: r=0, but should be 1, so r = m - 4k + 1

m=4k: r=1

m=5k-1: r=5k-1 -4k +1 = k, yes.

q= -k

- Then cell 5k-1: (-k,k) = C5

- Sixth side (direction (1,0)): move east.

From (-k,k) to (0,k)

Cells: q from -k+1 to 0, r=k

Cell m: for m=5k to 6k-1: q= m - 5k - k ? When m=5k: q= -k+1? Since from (-k,k) move east to (-k+1,k)

m=5k: q= -k+1

m=5k+1: q= -k+2

...

m=6k-1: q=0

So q = m - 5k - k + 1? m - 5k: for m=5k:0, but q= -k+1, so q = m - 5k - k + 1 = m - 6k +1

m=5k: q=5k -6k +1= -k+1, yes

m=6k-1: q=6k-1-6k+1=0, yes.

r=k

Then cell 6k-1: (0,k) = C6

Now, for our purpose, we have ring k=26, number 2026.

Start of ring: n_start = 1951

So the index within the ring: let idx = n - n_start = 2026 - 1951 = 75

Since n_start is cell 0, so idx=75 means the 76th cell in the ring? Index from 0 to 155 (since 156 cells), so idx=75 is the 76th cell, but index 75.

Now, we need to find which side it is on, and position.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k=26 cells.

The cells are grouped per side: side 1: cells 0 to 25 (since k=26, cells 0 to 25? Earlier for side 1: cells m=0 to k-1=25, so 26 cells.

Similarly each side has k cells.

So total cells: 6 * 26 = 156, good.

Now, side 1: cells 0 to 25

Side 2: cells 26 to 51? Since k=26, side 2: from cell k=26 to cell 2k-1=52-1=51? Earlier for side 2: cells m=k to 2k-1, so for k=26, m=26 to 51 inclusive.

Number of cells: 51-26+1=26, good.

Side 3: m=2k to 3k-1=52 to 77? 3*26-1=78-1=77? 52 to 77 inclusive: 77-52+1=26 cells.

But idx=75, which is between 52 and 77? 52 to 77, 75<77, so yes.

Side 4: m=3k to 4k-1=78 to 103? 4*26-1=104-1=103

Side 5: 104 to 129? 5k=130, to 5k-1=129? m=4k to 5k-1=104 to 129? 4k=104, 5k-1=129, yes.

Side 6: m=5k to 6k-1=130 to 155.

Now idx=75, and side 3: m=52 to 77, so 75 is in side 3.

Side 3: cells from m=2k to 3k-1, i.e., 52 to 77.

This side corresponds to the third side, direction west, with cells (q, -k) for q from k-1 down to 0.

k=26.

From earlier: for side 3: cell m: q = 3k-1 - m, r = -k

With m from 2k to 3k-1.

So q = 3k -1 - m

r = -k

For m=75, k=26

q = 3*26 -1 -75 = 78 -1 -75 = 77 -75 = 2

r = -26

So position (q,r) = (2, -26)

Now, we need the six neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors in hex grid: as defined earlier, the six adjacent cells are at:

(q+1,r), (q,r-1), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)? Earlier we had the vectors: (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1)

List:

1. East: (q+1, r)

2. Northeast: (q+1, r-1)  // since earlier (1,-1)

3. North: (q, r-1)  // (0,-1)

4. West: (q-1, r)  // (-1,0)

5. Northwest: (q-1, r+1)  // (-1,1)

6. South: (q, r+1)  // (0,1)

In our coordinate, r increases downward, so (q,r-1) is north, (q,r+1) is south.

So neighbors of (q,r) = (2,-26):

1. (2+1, -26) = (3,-26)

2. (2+1, -26-1) = (3,-27)

3. (2, -26-1) = (2,-27)

4. (2-1, -26) = (1,-26)

5. (2-1, -26+1) = (1,-25)

6. (2, -26+1) = (2,-25)

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions, but they might be in different rings.

First, note that the cell itself is at (2,-26), which is in ring k=26, since distance d = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2 = (|2| + |-26| + |2-26|)/2 = (2+26+| -24|)/2 = (28+24)/2=52/2=26, yes.

Now neighbors:

1. (3,-26): d = (|3| + |-26| + |3-26|)/2 = (3+26+23)/2=52/2=26, same ring.

2. (3,-27): d = (3+27+|3-27|)/2 = (30+| -24|)/2=(30+24)/2=54/2=27, so ring 27.

3. (2,-27): d=(2+27+|2-27|)/2=(29+25)/2=54/2=27, ring 27.

4. (1,-26): d=(1+26+|1-26|)/2=(27+25)/2=52/2=26, same ring.

5. (1,-25): d=(1+25+|1-25|)/2=(26+24)/2=50/2=25, ring 25.

6. (2,-25): d=(2+25+|2-25|)/2=(27+23)/2=50/2=25, ring 25.

So neighbors in ring 26: (3,-26) and (1,-26)

In ring 27: (3,-27) and (2,-27)

In ring 25: (1,-25) and (2,-25)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

Since we have the coordinates and the ring, we can find the index in the ring.

First, for same ring k=26.

Cell (3,-26) and (1,-26)

Now, in ring 26, side 3: cells with q from k-1 down to 0, r=-k, i.e., q from 25 down to 0, r=-26.

And cell m: q = 3k-1 - m = 3*26 -1 -m=78-1-m=77-m

r=-26

So for (q,r)=(3,-26), q=3, so 77-m=3, so m=77-3=74

Similarly, for (1,-26), q=1, 77-m=1, m=77-1=76

Now m is the index in the ring, from 0 to 155.

m=74 and m=76.

Now n = n_start + m = 1951 + m

So for m=74: n=1951+74=2025

m=76: n=1951+76=2027

But our cell is at m=75, n=2026, neighbors at (3,-26) is m=74, n=2025, and (1,-26) is m=76, n=2027.

But are they adjacent? In the ring, m=74,75,76 are consecutive cells? In side 3, cells are in order of q decreasing, so q=77-m, so m=52: q=77-52=25

m=53: q=24

...

m=74: q=77-74=3

m=75: q=77-75=2

m=76: q=77-76=1

m=77: q=77-77=0

So yes, consecutive: m=74: (3,-26), m=75: (2,-26), m=76: (1,-26)

So neighbors are n=2025 and n=2027, which are adjacent in the spiral.

But we need all six neighbors, including those in other rings.

Now, neighbors in ring 27: (3,-27) and (2,-27)

Ring k=27, distance 27.

n_start for ring 27: n_start(k) = 1 + 3(k-1)k

For k=27: 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702=1+2106=2107

End: 3k(k+1)=3*27*28=3*756=2268

Now, position (3,-27) and (2,-27)

In ring 27, which side?

First, find the coordinates.

Ring 27 starts at S_{27} = (1,27-1)=(1,26)

Then side 1: cells m=0 to 26: (1+m, 26 - m) for m=0 to 26? Earlier: cell m: (1+m, k-1 - m) = (1+m, 27-1 - m) = (1+m, 26 - m)

So for m=0: (1,26)

m=1: (2,25)

...

m=26: (27,0)

Now, we have (3,-27) and (2,-27), which are not in this side.

Side 2: cells m=k to 2k-1, i.e., m=27 to 53

Cell m: (k, -(m - k + 1)) = (27, -(m - 27 + 1)) = (27, -(m - 26))

Since k=27.

q=k=27, r= -(m - k + 1) = -(m - 27 + 1) = -(m - 26)

So for m=27: r= -(27-26)= -1

m=28: r=-2

...

m=53: r= -(53-26)= -27

So cells: (27,-1), (27,-2), ..., (27,-27)

But we need (3,-27), not here.

Side 3: m=2k to 3k-1=54 to 80? 3*27-1=81-1=80

Cell m: q=3k-1 - m = 3*27 -1 -m=81-1-m=80-m

r= -k= -27

So q=80-m, r=-27

For (q,r)=(3,-27): q=3, so 80-m=3, m=77

Similarly for (2,-27): q=2, 80-m=2, m=78

Now m=77 and 78, which are within 54 to 80? 77 and 78 yes.

Now n = n_start + m = 2107 + m

So for (3,-27): m=77, n=2107+77=2184

For (2,-27): m=78, n=2107+78=2185

Now, neighbors in ring 25: (1,-25) and (2,-25)

Ring k=25, distance 25.

n_start(k=25) = 1 + 3*(25-1)*25 = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600=1+1800=1801

End: 3*25*26=1950, as before.

Position (1,-25) and (2,-25)

In ring 25, which side?

Side 3: similar to before.

Side 3: m=2k to 3k-1=50 to 74? k=25, 2k=50, 3k-1=75-1=74

Cell m: q=3k-1 -m=75-1-m=74-m

r=-k=-25

So for (q,r)=(1,-25): q=1, so 74-m=1, m=73

For (2,-25): q=2, 74-m=2, m=72

Now m=72 and 73, within 50 to 74? Yes.

n = n_start + m = 1801 + m

So for (1,-25): m=73, n=1801+73=1874

For (2,-25): m=72, n=1801+72=1873

Now, we have all six neighbors:

- (3,-26): n=2025

- (1,-26): n=2027

- (3,-27): n=2184

- (2,-27): n=2185

- (1,-25): n=1874

- (2,-25): n=1873

Now sum: 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 + 1874 + 1873

Compute step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

1874 + 1873 = 3747

Now sum these: 4052 + 4369 = 8421

8421 + 3747 = 12168

Add: 8421 + 3700 = 12121, plus 47 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

But let me verify with a smaller example to make sure.

For example, take number 1 at (0,0). Its neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

Now according to formula, but we have the positions.

Neighbors: (1,0):2, (1,-1):3, (0,-1):4, (-1,0):5, (-1,1):6, (0,1):7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

Now for another number, say number 8 at (1,1) in ring 2.

Neighbors: should be adjacent cells.

From grid: neighbors of (1,1): 

- East: (2,1)? But in ring 2, (2,1) is not present? Distance: (2,1): |2|+|1|+|3|=6, distance 3? Ring 3.

Actual neighbors: in hex grid, adjacent to (1,1):

(1+1,1)=(2,1)

(1,1-1)=(1,0)

(1-1,1)=(0,1)

(1,1+1)=(1,2)

(1+1,1-1)=(2,0)

(1-1,1+1)=(0,2)

Now, which numbers? (2,1): in ring 3? Distance (|2|+|1|+|3|)/2=6/2=3, ring 3.

(1,0): ring 1, n=2? But (1,0) is n=2.

(0,1): ring 1, n=7

(1,2): ring 3? Distance (1+2+|3|)/2=6/2=3

(2,0): ring 2, n=9

(0,2): ring 2, n=19? End.

From earlier assignment: (1,1) is n=8

Neighbors:

- (2,1): later, ring 3, n=20? Since ring 3 starts at (1,2)? Earlier for ring 3, cell0: (1,2), but (2,1) might be cell1 or something.

In ring 3: start (1,2), then to (2,1)? From (1,2) to (2,1): vector (1,-1), same as before.

Cell0: (1,2) n=20

Cell1: (2,1) n=21? Assuming sequence.

But (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1).

Similarly, (1,0): n=2

(0,1): n=7

(1,2): n=20

(2,0): n=9

(0,2): n=19

So neighbors: 2,7,9,19,20, and (2,1) which is n=21? 

List: (1,0):2, (0,1):7, (2,0):9, (0,2):19, (1,2):20, (2,1):21

Sum: 2+7+9+19+20+21= let's compute: 2+7=9, +9=18, +19=37, +20=57, +21=78.

Now, according to our method, for n=8, which is in ring k=2, idx=n - n_start, n_start ring2=8? Earlier ring2 starts at n=8, so idx=0.

Position: S2=(1,1)

We need neighbors: same as above.

But to verify the sum calculation.

In our case for 2026, we have neighbors: 2025,2027,2184,2185,1873,1874.

Sum 12168.

But in the small example, for n=8, neighbors sum to 78.

Now, is there a pattern? But probably correct.

Since the neighbors are symmetric, but in this case, for a cell not on the corner, it has neighbors in three different rings: one in same ring, two in inner ring, three in outer? In this case, we have two in same ring (but adjacent), two in inner ring (ring 25), two in outer ring (ring 27).

In the sum, we have two consecutive in same ring: 2025 and 2027, which are adjacent to 2026.

Then two in ring 25: 1873 and 1874, which might be adjacent to each other? 1873 and 1874 are consecutive numbers? Probably adjacent.

Similarly in ring 27: 2184 and 2185 consecutive.

But anyway, we have the numbers.

So sum is 2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185

We computed as 12168.

But let me add again:

Group: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168? 7799 + 4000 = 11799, +369 = 11799 + 370 -1 = 12169 -1 = 12168, yes.

4052 + 4369 = 8421, as before, +3747=8421+3747=12168.

So the sum is 12168.

But the problem asks for the sum of all six neighbors, and we have it.

Now, to box the answer.

But just to be thorough, are all these neighbors distinct and correct? In the grid, since it's a spiral, no duplicates, and we have six distinct neighbors.

For example, in the small case, it worked.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located in ring 26 of the hexagonal spiral, at axial coordinates \((q, r) = (2, -26)\). The six neighbors of this cell are at the following coordinates:

- \((3, -26)\)
- \((1, -26)\)
- \((3, -27)\)
- \((2, -27)\)
- \((1, -25)\)
- \((2, -25)\)

These neighbors belong to different rings based on their distances from the origin:

- \((3, -26)\) and \((1, -26)\) are in ring 26.
- \((3, -27)\) and \((2, -27)\) are in ring 27.
- \((1, -25)\) and \((2, -25)\) are in ring 25.

The starting number for each ring is given by \(n_{\text{start}}(k) = 1 + 3k(k-1)\), and the index within the ring is used to find the specific numbers.

- For ring 26 (\(k = 26\)), \(n_{\text{start}} = 1951\):
  - \((3, -26)\) corresponds to index \(m = 74\), so the number is \(1951 + 74 = 2025\).
  - \((1, -26)\) corresponds to index \(m = 76\), so the number is \(1951 + 76 = 2027\).

- For ring 27 (\(k = 27\)), \(n_{\text{start}} = 2107\):
  - \((3, -27)\) corresponds to index \(m = 77\), so the number is \(2107 + 77 = 2184\).
  - \((2, -27)\) corresponds to index \(m = 78\), so the number is \(2107 + 78 = 2185\).

- For ring 25 (\(k = 25\)), \(n_{\text{start}} = 1801\):
  - \((2, -25)\) corresponds to index \(m = 72\), so the number is \(1801 + 72 = 1873\).
  - \((1, -25)\) corresponds to index \(m = 73\), so the number is \(1801 + 73 = 1874\).

The neighbors are the numbers 2025, 2027, 2184, 2185, 1873, and 1874. Their sum is calculated as follows:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(2184 + 2185 = 4369\)
- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(4052 + 4369 = 8421\)
- \(8421 + 3747 = 12168\)

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

\boxed{12168}
