The problem involves natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. I need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on the hexagonal grid.

From the example, it shows:

... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

It seems like 1 is at the center, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7, but in the diagram, it's not symmetric. Let me sketch this out.

Assume the center is 1. Then clockwise or counterclockwise, but looking at the neighbors:

Directly to the right of 1 is 2, above-right is 3, above-left is 4? But in the diagram, above 1 is not directly shown, but we have:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3 10 ... this might be above.

Perhaps the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops. In hexagonal grids, there are two common orientations.

Looking at the numbers: around 1, we see 2,9? No, in the middle row: 15,5,1,2,9

So left of 1 is 5? But 5 is below-left or something.

List the neighbors of each number based on the diagram.

For 1: adjacent to 2 (right), 5 (left? but 5 is listed left in the row, but in hex grid, left might not be adjacent if it's diagonal.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. So for cell 1, it should have six neighbors.

From the diagram:

- To the right: 2

- To the left: 5? But in the row it's 15,5,1,2,9 so 5 is left, 2 is right.

But in hex grid, left and right are adjacent only if it's a straight line, but typically in hex grids, horizontal neighbors are adjacent.

Also, diagonally above and below.

But in the diagram, above 1, we have row above: 14,4,3,10

So probably 4 and 3 are above 1.

Similarly, below: 16,6,7,8

So 6 and 7 are below 1.

Now, let's see adjacency.

Assume that horizontally, left and right are adjacent.

Vertically, in hex grid, it's offset.

For example, cell above 1 might be between left and right neighbors.

From the diagram, relative to 1:

- Right: 2

- Left: 5

- Upper-right: 3? Since above row has 3 to the right of 1's position.

In the upper row: 14,4,3,10. Since 1 is below, probably the cells above are shifted.

Typically, in hex grids with flat tops, the row above is offset by half a cell.

But here, looking at numbers, for 1:

- Directly above: perhaps 4? But 4 is listed, and 3 is to the right of 4.

But 3 is adjacent to 2? Since 2 is right of 1, and 3 is upper-right, so probably adjacent.

Similarly, below, 6 and 7.

Let me list the neighbors of 1.

From the spiral, 1 is surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Because after 1, it goes to 2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc.

The sequence starts at 1, then adds neighbors.

The spiral path: from 1, it goes to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right), then to 4 (up-left), then to 5 (left), then to 6 (down-left), then to 7 (down-right), then to 8 (right), but 8 is adjacent to 7, and then to 9 (up-right), etc.

In the diagram, after 7 is 8, which is to the right of 7, and then 9 is upper-right of 8, but in the row, it's shown as ...9 after 2, but 2 is already there.

The diagram shows:

Middle row: 15,5,1,2,9

Lower row: 16,6,7,8

Upper row: 14,4,3,10

So let's map the positions.

Assume the grid is hexagonal with pointy tops, so horizontal rows.

Set coordinates.

Define a coordinate system for hexagonal grid.

A common system is axial coordinates with two axes, q and r, or cube coordinates.

To make it easy, I can use a system where each cell has a position (x,y) with x horizontal, y vertical, but since it's hex, the y-coordinate might be offset.

For simplicity, I can think in terms of rings.

Notice that the spiral starts at center 1, then the first ring has numbers 2 through 7, which is 6 numbers.

Then next ring has 8 through 19? Let's see the diagram: after 7 is 8, then 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc.

In the diagram, we have 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, but 16 is in lower row, 15 in middle, etc.

From 1, the neighbors are 2 to 7.

Then the next layer: 8 to 19? But in diagram, we see up to 16, but probably 17,18,19 are not shown.

Count how many numbers in each ring.

The center cell: ring 0, 1 cell.

First ring: ring 1, 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Second ring: ring 2, should have more cells. Since each ring adds cells proportional to radius.

In a hexagonal grid, the number of cells in ring k is 6k for k≥1, and ring 0 has 1 cell.

Ring 1: 6 cells, yes.

Ring 2: should be 12 cells? Because circumference grows linearly.

Total cells up to ring k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1

k=1: 1+6=7 cells: numbers 1 to 7.

k=2: 1+3*2*3=1+18=19 cells: numbers 1 to 19.

In the diagram, we have up to 16, but probably 17,18,19 are there but not shown.

In upper row: 14,4,3,10 — 4 and 3 are part of ring 1, 14 and 10 might be ring 2.

Similarly, middle: 15,5,1,2,9 — 5,1,2 ring 0 and 1, 15 and 9 ring 2.

Lower: 16,6,7,8 — 6,7 ring 1, 16 and 8 ring 2.

So numbers 8 to 19 are in ring 2, 12 cells, yes.

8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.

In diagram, 8 is shown, 9,10,14,15,16, so missing 11,12,13,17,18,19, but they are implied.

Now, the spiral order: it starts at 1, then goes to 2,3,4,5,6,7, then to 8.

After 7, where does it go? In the diagram, 7 is in lower row, and 8 is to the right of 7? In lower row: 16,6,7,8 so probably 8 is to the right of 7.

Then next should be 9, which is in middle row to the right of 2? Middle row has 2 and then 9, so yes, 9 is to the right of 2.

But 2 is above 7? Let's see the relative positions.

From 7 (lower row), right is 8.

Then from 8, probably up-right to 9, since 9 is in middle row to the right.

Middle row is above lower row? Typically, rows are stacked vertically.

Assume rows: row y=0: middle row: numbers ...15,5,1,2,9...

But 1 is at center, so probably y=0.

Set y=0 for middle row.

Then upper row y=1, lower row y=-1.

In hex grid with pointy tops, for a given row, the x-coordinates are integers, and adjacent rows are offset.

Specifically, for row y, the cells are at (x,y) with x integer, and neighbors are (x±1,y), (x,y±1), but (x,y±1) would be directly above, but in hex grid, directly above might not be aligned; instead, it's (x±1,y±1) depending on offset.

Standard axial coordinates: let’s say q and r, with s = -q - r, but perhaps simpler.

I recall that in such spirals, the position can be determined by the ring and the side.

Each ring k has 6k cells, for k≥1.

The first cell of ring k is after the last cell of ring k-1.

Total cells up to ring k-1 is S(k-1) = 1 + 3(k-1)k

For k=0, S(-1)=0, S(0)=1

S(1)=1+3*1*2=7? Earlier I said 1+3k(k+1), but for k=1, 1+3*1*2=7, yes.

General formula: total cells up to ring m is T(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1) ? For m=0,1; m=1,7; m=2,1+3*2*3=19, yes.

T(m) = 3m(m+1) + 1

The first number in ring k is T(k-1) + 1

For k=1, T(0)+1=1+1=2

k=2, T(1)+1=7+1=8

k=3, T(2)+1=19+1=20, and so on.

Now, ring k has 6k cells.

These cells are arranged in six sides, each with k cells.

For example, ring 1: 6 cells, one per side: positions say, starting from east, then northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, or something.

In the diagram, from 1, it goes to 2 (east), then to 3 (northeast), then to 4 (northwest), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (southwest), then to 7 (southeast).

Then next, to 8. Where is 8? From 7 (southeast), it goes to 8, which in diagram is east of 7? But southeast to east might not be adjacent directly.

In the spiral, after 7, it goes to 8, which is adjacent to 7 and also to 1? But 1 is already surrounded, so probably 8 is adjacent to 7 and to the next cell.

In ring 2, there are 12 cells, so two per side.

Typically, the spiral goes outwards.

From 7 (which is at the southeast corner of ring 1), it moves outward to the next ring, in the same direction or adjacent.

In many spirals, it continues in the direction it was going, but here, after placing 7, it might turn.

Looking at diagram: 7 is at (say) southeast, then 8 is to the east of 7, but since it's ring 2, and ring 2 starts, probably 8 is the first cell of ring 2.

In ring 2, the cells are added along each side.

The direction: from 7 to 8, in diagram, 7 is in lower row, 8 is to the right, so same row, so probably east direction.

Then from 8 to 9: in diagram, 9 is in middle row to the right of 2, so if middle row is above, and 8 is below, so from 8 (lower row, x say), to 9 (middle row, x+1), so up-right direction.

Then from 9 to 10: upper row has 10 to the right of 3? Upper row: 14,4,3,10 so 3 is there, then 10 is to the right of 3? But 3 is ring 1, 10 is ring 2, so probably adjacent.

After 9, it goes to 10. Where is 10? In upper row, right of 3, so if 3 is at north, then east of north.

But let's list the sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...

In diagram: after 7 is 8 (east), then 9 (up-right, to middle row), then 10? Where? Upper row has 3 and 10, but 3 is already there, so after 9, it should go to 10, which might be north of 9 or something.

9 is in middle row, say at x=2 or something, upper row is above, so probably directly above 9 is a cell, but in hex grid, directly above might not be aligned.

Assume that from 9, it goes north to 10. But in diagram, upper row has 4,3,10, and 4 and 3 are ring 1, so 10 is probably adjacent to 3.

Since 3 is at north of center, and 10 is east of 3, so from 9 (which is east of 2, and 2 is east of center), so 9 is southeast of center? Let's assign coordinates.

Set center at (0,0).

Assume hex grid with axial coordinates q,r.

Set q east-west, r northwest-southeast, or something.

Standard: let q be the column, r be the row, but with offset.

For simplicity, define the grid such that the center is (0,0).

Neighbors: east: (1,0), west: (-1,0), northeast: (0,1), northwest: (-1,1), southeast: (1,-1), southwest: (0,-1)? Let's see the vector sum.

In cube coordinates, each direction has a vector.

But for this spiral, I can find a formula for the position of number n.

Since I need to find neighbors of 2026, I can find which ring it's in, and its position in the ring.

First, find which ring k contains 2026.

The total cells up to ring m is T(m) = 3m(m+1) + 1

Set T(m) ≥ 2026, find smallest m.

Solve 3m(m+1) +1 ≥ 2026

3m^2 + 3m +1 ≥ 2026

3m^2 + 3m - 2025 ≥ 0

Divide by 3: m^2 + m - 675 ≥ 0

Solve quadratic: m = [-1 ± √(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± √2701]/2

√2701, let me compute: 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 2704-2701=3, so √2701 ≈ 51.97, so m ≥ [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.485

So m ≥ 26? Since m integer.

Check m=25: T(25) = 3*25*26 +1 = 3*650 +1 = 1950 +1 = 1951

1951 < 2026

T(26) = 3*26*27 +1 = 3*702 +1 = 2106 +1 = 2107

2107 > 2026, so yes, up to ring 25 has 1951 cells, so ring 26 starts at 1952.

T(25) = 3*25*26 +1 = 1950 +1 = 1951, so numbers 1 to 1951 are in rings 0 to 25.

Ring 26 starts at 1952 and has 6*26 = 156 cells, from 1952 to 1951 + 156 = 2107? 1951 + 156 = 2107, yes, since T(26)=2107.

So 2026 is in ring 26, since 1952 ≤ 2026 ≤ 2107.

Now, the position in the ring: the first cell of ring k is at position 1, and there are 6k cells.

Ring k has 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are in order: typically, starting from the east side, or wherever the spiral starts.

In the first ring, k=1, cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7 corresponding to directions.

From earlier, 2 is east, 3 is northeast, 4 is northwest, 5 is west, 6 is southwest, 7 is southeast.

Then for ring 2, starts at 8, which is adjacent to 7 (southeast), and since it's ring 2, it might be on the southeast side or something.

In ring 2, first cell 8 is in the same direction as the last cell of previous ring, which is southeast (7).

In many spirals, the first cell of the new ring is in the direction of the "exit" of the previous ring.

Here, after placing 7 at southeast, it moves to the next ring in the southeast direction, but since it's a new ring, it might be placed at a cell adjacent to 7 and outside.

In the diagram, 7 is at southeast, 8 is east of 7, but east might be the direction.

From earlier diagram, lower row: 16,6,7,8 — so if y=-1, x: say 6 at x=0? But center is (0,0), so neighbors: east (1,0)=2, southeast? Let's define.

Set center (0,0).

Assume:

- East: (1,0) = 2

- Northeast: (1,1) or (0,1)? Standard cube coordinates.

Use offset coordinates.

Set for row y, the x-coordinates, with y integer, and for even y, x even, or something. But to make center (0,0), and symmetric.

From the sequence:

Cell 1: (0,0)

Then moves east to cell 2: (1,0)

Then moves northeast to cell 3: (1,1)? But in hex grid, from (1,0) to (1,1) might not be adjacent if rows are horizontal.

Assume pointy top hex grid, so neighbors are: east (q+1,r), west (q-1,r), northeast (q,r+1), northwest (q-1,r+1), southeast (q,r-1), southwest (q-1,r-1)? Let's define.

Standard axial coordinates: q and r, with s = -q - r.

Neighbors: (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)? But (q+1,r) and (q,r+1) are adjacent, but the vectors.

Better to use cube coordinates: three coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0.

Then neighbors: (x+1,y-1,z), (x+1,y,z-1), etc., but standard: the six directions:

- East: (1,-1,0)

- Northeast: (1,0,-1)

- Northwest: (0,1,-1)

- West: (-1,1,0)

- Southwest: (-1,0,1)

- Southeast: (0,-1,1)

Sum to zero.

For center (0,0,0)

East: (1,-1,0) = cell 2

Then from (1,-1,0), it goes to northeast. Northeast is (1,0,-1)

So cell 3: (1,0,-1)

Then to northwest: northwest is (0,1,-1)

Cell 4: (0,1,-1)

Then to west: (-1,1,0)

Cell 5: (-1,1,0)

Then to southwest: (-1,0,1)

Cell 6: (-1,0,1)

Then to southeast: (0,-1,1)

Cell 7: (0,-1,1)

Now, next, to cell 8. From (0,-1,1), it should go to the next ring. In which direction? Probably continues in the same direction it was going, but since it just came from southwest to southeast, it was moving southeast, so continue southeast? Southeast is (0,-1,1), but that's itself. Directions are relative.

The last move was from 6 to 7: southwest to southeast? From cell 6 (-1,0,1) to cell 7 (0,-1,1), which is a move of (1,-1,0)? Difference: (0 - (-1), -1 - 0, 1-1) = (1,-1,0), which is east direction.

From (-1,0,1) to (0,-1,1): delta (1,-1,0), which is east.

But southeast direction is (0,-1,1), which is different.

The direction of move: from 6 to 7 is in the east direction, since delta (1,-1,0).

Then to go to next ring, it might move in a direction perpendicular or continue.

In spiral, typically, after completing a ring, it moves outward to start the next ring.

From cell 7 (0,-1,1), it moves east to cell 8? But east would be (1,-1,0) + something? To move outward.

In the diagram, from 7 to 8 is east, so to (1,-1,0)? But (1,-1,0) is already cell 2.

Conflict.

Perhaps it moves in the direction of the next side.

From 7 at southeast, it moves east to a new cell.

In cube coordinates, from (0,-1,1), moving east: (1,-1,0), but that's occupied by 2.

So cannot. Therefore, it must move to a different direction.

Typically, in hexagonal spiral, when starting a new ring, it moves in the "forward" direction relative to the last move.

Last move was from 6 to 7: delta (1,-1,0) east.

Then to start new ring, it might turn 60 degrees, say left or right.

In this case, from 7, after arriving from west (since delta was east, so came from west), so it might turn to go northeast or southeast.

In the diagram, it goes east to 8, but east is occupied? No, in ring 2, new cells.

From 7 (0,-1,1), moving east: to (1,-1,0)? But (1,-1,0) is cell 2, which is already there. So cannot go there.

Perhaps the move is not to an adjacent cell in the same direction, but to a new cell in the outward direction.

The cell adjacent to 7 in the southeast direction, but southeast is a direction, but outward.

From 7, the neighbor in the direction it was going.

Perhaps the first cell of the new ring is adjacent to the last cell of previous ring and is in the "corner" direction.

In this case, for ring 2, cell 8 is adjacent to cell 7 and to cell 1? But cell 1 is already there, and neighbors should be only one shared or something.

Let's calculate the neighbors.

From the diagram, cell 7 is at (0,-1,1), neighbors are: the six directions:

- East: (1,-1,0) = cell 2

- Northeast: (1,0,-1) = cell 3

- Northwest: (0,0,0)? (0-1, -1+1,1+0)? Northwest is (-1,1,0)? From (0,-1,1), northwest: add (-1,1,0)? Standard: the neighbors are obtained by adding the six vectors: (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)

So for cell 7: (0,-1,1)

Add (1,-1,0): (1,-2,1)

Add (1,0,-1): (1,-1,0) — this is cell 2

Add (0,1,-1): (0,0,0) — cell 1

Add (-1,1,0): (-1,0,1) — cell 6

Add (-1,0,1): (-1,-1,2) — not occupied yet

Add (0,-1,1): (0,-2,2) — not occupied

So neighbors are cell 1,2,6, and three new cells: (1,-2,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2)

Now, in the spiral, cell 8 is placed at one of these, adjacent to 7.

From diagram, it is to the east of 7, and in the lower row, same as 7, so probably same y, different x.

In cube coordinates, y is one coordinate, but here the coordinates are not aligned with rows.

In the diagram, lower row has y=-1 or something, but cells have different z.

For cell 7: (0,-1,1), and it is in the "lower" row, but what is the row? Perhaps the sum x+y+z=0, but for cell 7: 0-1+1=0, good.

The "row" might be defined by r or something.

In the diagram, lower row has cells with same r if we use axial r.

To match the diagram, in lower row, we have 16,6,7,8

Cell 6: (-1,0,1)

Cell 7: (0,-1,1)

Cell 8: ? if to the right of 7, so if we think x-coordinate, from 6 to 7 is from x=-1 to x=0, so increasing x, so 8 at x=1.

Cell 6: (-1,0,1), cell 7: (0,-1,1), so x-coordinate is not consistent.

Perhaps use axial coordinates.

Set q and r, with s = -q - r.

Let q be the east-west coordinate.

For cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: east: (1,0) in (q,r)? But then r is north-south? But in axial, neighbors are (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1), etc.

Standard axial: neighbors are (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)

For cell 1: (0,0)

East: (1,0) = cell 2

Northeast: (1,1)? But (1,1) is not a neighbor; distance |dq| + |dr| + |ds| but in axial, the distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|), but for neighbors, it should be at Manhattan distance 1.

From (0,0), (1,0) is neighbor, (0,1) is neighbor, (1,-1) is neighbor, etc.

(1,0): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1, sum |1|+|0|+|-1|=2, not 1. I think I confuse.

In cube coordinates, it's easier.

Back to cube.

Cell 7: (0,-1,1)

Adjacent cells: as above, (1,-2,1), (1,-1,0), (0,0,0), (-1,0,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2)

Occupied: (1,-1,0) = cell 2, (0,0,0) = cell 1, (-1,0,1) = cell 6

Unoccupied: (1,-2,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2)

Now, in the diagram, cell 8 is to the east of 7. What does "east" mean? In the grid, east might be the (1,-1,0) direction, but that's already occupied.

Perhaps "east" in the diagram is not the same as the coordinate east.

In the lower row, cells are at the same "level", but in cube coordinates, the sum x+y+z=0, so they are on the plane, but the row might be defined by y or z.

For cell 6: (-1,0,1), cell 7: (0,-1,1), cell 8: say (1,-2,1) or (0,-2,2) or (-1,-1,2)

If we look at the z-coordinate, cell 6 and 7 have z=1, cell 8 might have z=1 or 2.

In the diagram, it's in the same row, so probably same z or same y.

Assume that in the lower row, the cells have the same r if we use axial, but let's calculate the position.

From the sequence, after 7, it goes to 8, and in diagram, it's to the right, and then to 9, which is in the middle row, so probably above and right.

So from 7 (0,-1,1), to 8, say (1,-2,1), then to 9, which should be adjacent to 8 and to 2 or something.

Cell 9 is in middle row, and to the right of 2, and 2 is at (1,-1,0)

From 8 (1,-2,1), neighbors include (1,-1,0) = cell 2, and (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), etc.

(1,-1,0) is cell 2, so if 9 is at (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1) or (0,-1,0) etc.

In diagram, it's to the right of 2, so if 2 is at (1,-1,0), right might be (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)

Probably (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1)

Then from there to 10, which is in upper row, and to the right of 3, and 3 is at (1,0,-1)

So likely 10 is at (2,0,-2) or something.

Let's assume that cell 8 is at (1,-2,1), since it's east of 7 (0,-1,1), and if east is +q direction.

Then cell 9: from 8, it goes to 9, which is up-right, so perhaps to (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1)

If to (2,-2,0), then neighbors of 8: (1,-2,1) neighbors: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2) etc.

(1,-1,0) is cell 2, so if 9 is at (2,-2,0), then it is adjacent to 8 and to 2? Since (2,-2,0) and (1,-1,0) are not adjacent; distance |2-1| + |-2+1| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, not 1, so not adjacent.

If to (2,-1,-1), then distance to 2 (1,-1,0): |2-1| + |-1+1| + |-1-0| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

If to (0,-1,0), but that might be occupied or not.

(0,-1,0) is not yet occupied; is it a neighbor of 8? From (1,-2,1) to (0,-1,0): delta (-1,1,-1), not a neighbor vector; distance |1-0| + |-2+1| + |1-0| =1+1+1=3, not 1.

So not adjacent.

Perhaps cell 8 is at (0,-2,2)

Then neighbors: (1,-2,1), (-1,-2,3), (0,-1,1), (0,-3,3), (1,-3,2), (-1,-1,2)

(0,-1,1) is cell 7, so adjacent.

Then to 9, say (1,-2,1) or (1,-3,2) etc.

But in diagram, 9 is in middle row, which is y=0 or something.

Cell 2 is at (1,-1,0), middle row.

So probably cell 9 is at (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1) or (1,0,-1) but occupied.

Assume that the "row" is defined by the sum or difference.

Notice that in the lower row, cells have the same z-coordinate or same y.

Cell 6: (-1,0,1), cell 7: (0,-1,1), so z=1 for both.

Cell 8: if to the right, and same row, so same z, so z=1, and x increases, so from cell 7 (0,-1,1), to (1,-2,1), since y = -x - z = -1 -1 = -2, wait no, in cube, x+y+z=0, so for z=1, x+y= -1.

Cell 7: x=0, y= -1, z=1, sum 0-1+1=0.

Cell 8: if same z=1, and x=1, then y= -1 -1 = -2, so (1,-2,1)

Then cell 6: (-1,0,1), so at x= -1, y=0, z=1.

So in lower row, z=1, x from -1 to 0 to 1, y = -x -1.

Cells: x= -1, y=0; x=0, y= -1; x=1, y= -2.

So not on a straight line in terms of x or y, but in the diagram, it's shown as a row, so probably it's a diagonal in the coordinate system, but for the purpose, we can work with coordinates.

So cell 8: (1,-2,1)

Then cell 9: from 8, it goes to 9, which is in middle row, and to the right of 2.

Middle row has z=0? Cell 1: (0,0,0), cell 2: (1,-1,0), cell 5: (-1,1,0), so z=0 for middle row.

Cell 9 is in middle row, so z=0, and to the right of 2, which is at (1,-1,0), so probably x>1, say (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)

If (2,-2,0), sum 2-2+0=0, good.

If (2,-1,-1), sum 2-1-1=0, also good.

Now, which one is adjacent to 8? 8 is at (1,-2,1)

Distance to (2,-2,0): |1-2| + |-2+2| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

To (2,-1,-1): |1-2| + |-2+1| + |1+1| =1+1+2=4, not adjacent.

Problem.

Perhaps cell 8 is not at (1,-2,1), but at (0,-2,2)

Then neighbors: as above, (1,-2,1), etc.

To (1,-2,1), which is not occupied, or to (0,-1,1) = cell 7, etc.

Then to 9, if in middle row z=0, say (1,-1,0) but occupied, or (0,-1,0), or (-1,-1,2) etc.

(0,-1,0) is sum 0-1+0= -1 ≠0, not on plane.

Must have sum 0.

So (1,-1,0) occupied, (0,0,0) occupied, (-1,1,0) occupied, (0,1,-1) occupied, etc.

Possible: (1,0,-1) occupied by 3, ( -1,0,1) occupied by 6, (0,-1,1) by 7, so all neighbors of center are occupied.

For new cell, like (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), etc.

From 8 at (0,-2,2), to (1,-2,1) or (1,-3,2) or (-1,-1,2) etc.

Say to (1,-2,1), then from there to 9.

But 9 is in middle row, z=0, so need a cell with z=0, like (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1) or (1,-1,0) but occupied.

From (1,-2,1) to (2,-2,0): delta (1,0,-1), which is northeast direction, since (1,0,-1) is northeast vector.

And (2,-2,0) is in middle row if we consider z=0.

And it is to the right of 2 (1,-1,0)? 2 is at (1,-1,0), (2,-2,0) is at x=2,y= -2, while 2 is at x=1,y= -1, so not the same x or y.

But in the diagram, "to the right" might mean in the same row, but in the row, cells may not have the same x or y.

In the middle row of the diagram, it's shown as 15,5,1,2,9, so probably 9 is to the right of 2, so in the sequence, x-coordinate increasing, so if 2 is at some x, 9 at higher x.

Assume that in each row, the "x" coordinate is consistent.

For middle row y=0, cells have r=0 in axial, but let's define the coordinate along the row.

From the diagram, in middle row: cells at x= -2:15? But 15 is ring 2, not yet.

For now, cell 1: x=0, cell 5: x= -1, cell 2: x=1, cell 9: x=2? But cell 5 is at (-1,1,0) in cube, which is not on the same y.

Perhaps the "row" is defined by the sum x+y or something.

For cell in "middle row": cell 1: x+y+z=0, but x+y=0 (since z=0), so x+y=0.

Cell 2: 1+ (-1) =0, cell 5: -1+1=0, cell 3: 1+0=1, not 0, but cell 3 is in upper row? In diagram, upper row has 4,3,10, cell 4: (0,1,-1), x+y=0+1=1, cell 3: (1,0,-1), x+y=1+0=1, cell 10: say (2,0,-2), x+y=2+0=2, not same.

Lower row: cell 6: (-1,0,1), x+y= -1+0= -1, cell 7: (0,-1,1), x+y=0-1= -1, cell 8: (1,-2,1), x+y=1-2= -1, so for lower row, x+y= -1.

Upper row: cell 3: (1,0,-1), x+y=1+0=1, cell 4: (0,1,-1), x+y=0+1=1, cell 10: if (2,0,-2), x+y=2, not same, or (1,1,-2), x+y=2, or (0,2,-2), etc.

Cell 3 and 4 have x+y=1, so probably upper row has x+y=1.

Then cell 10 should have x+y=1, and be in ring 2.

So for example (1,0,-1) occupied, (0,1,-1) occupied, then (2,-1,-1), (1,1,-2), (0,2,-2), (-1,2,-1), etc.

Now in the diagram, it is to the right of 3, and 3 is at say x=1,y=0,z= -1, so if "right" means increase q, so increase x, so to (2,-1,-1) or (2,0,-2) but (2,0,-2) has x+y=2, not 1.

(2,-1,-1): x+y=2-1=1, good.

Similarly, for cell 9 in middle row, x+y=0, to the right of 2 (1,-1,0), so increase x, to (2,-1,-1) or (2,0,-2) but (2,0,-2) has x+y=2, not 0, (2,-1,-1) has x+y=1, not 0.

(2,-2,0): x+y=0, good.

So cell 9 at (2,-2,0)

Then cell 10 at (2,-1,-1)? But x+y=1, good for upper row.

Now, are they adjacent? From cell 8: we have it at (1,-2,1) for lower row.

To cell 9: (2,-2,0)

Distance: |1-2| + |-2+2| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent! Oh no.

From 8 to 9 is not adjacent? But in the spiral, it should be adjacent because it's a path.

In the spiral, the cells are placed in order, and each new cell is adjacent to the previous one, but not necessarily to the center or others.

For the path to be continuous, consecutive numbers are adjacent.

So from 7 to 8 must be adjacent, 8 to 9 adjacent, etc.

Cell 7: (0,-1,1)

Cell 8: must be adjacent, so one of the neighbors: (1,-2,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2), (1,-1,0) occupied, (0,0,0) occupied, (-1,0,1) occupied.

So (1,-2,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2)

In diagram, it's to the east, and same row, so likely (1,-2,1) or (0,-2,2)

If (1,-2,1), then to cell 9, which is in middle row, and adjacent to 8.

Neighbors of (1,-2,1): (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

(1,-1,0) is cell 2, occupied.

(0,-2,1) is not cell 7, cell 7 is (0,-1,1), different.

(0,-1,0) is not occupied yet.

So possible: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

Cell 9 is in middle row, so x+y=0, since for middle row cells have x+y+z=0 and z=0? No, not necessarily; cell 1,2,5 have z=0, but in ring 2, may have different.

For cell 9 to be in the same "row" as 2, which is the y=0 row in some sense, but in cube, the rows may be defined by the value of y or z.

From diagram, middle row has cells with the same r in axial, but let's assume that for the row, the coordinate that is constant is the one perpendicular to the row.

In this case, for the lower row, cells have the same z-coordinate, as cell 6,7,8 all have z=1.

Similarly, middle row: cell 1,2,5 have z=0.

Cell 9 should have z=0, since in middle row.

Similarly, upper row: cell 3,4 have z= -1? Cell 3: (1,0,-1), z= -1, cell 4: (0,1,-1), z= -1, so yes, upper row z= -1, middle z=0, lower z=1.

So cell 9 in middle row, so z=0.

Cell 8 in lower row, z=1.

So cell 8 at (1,-2,1) (since we assumed same z, and east of 7)

Then neighbors with z=0: but z is fixed for the cell, but neighbors can have different z.

To be adjacent, the cells are adjacent regardless of row, but for cell 9, it must have z=0, and be adjacent to cell 8 (1,-2,1)

So the neighbors of (1,-2,1) are: as above, (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

Among these, those with sum 0: (2,-2,0): 2-2+0=0, good; (2,-1,-1):2-1-1=0, good; (1,-1,0):1-1+0=0, but occupied by cell 2; (0,-2,1):0-2+1= -1≠0; (0,-1,0):0-1+0= -1≠0; (1,-3,2):1-3+2=0, good.

So possible: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-3,2)

Now, cell 9 is to the right of cell 2, and cell 2 is at (1,-1,0), so if "right" means increase x, then (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0) or (3,-2,-1) etc, but among neighbors, (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)

In the diagram, it's in the same row as 2, and to the right, so probably same z, and same y or something, but both have z=0, same as cell 2.

Cell 2 at (1,-1,0), so y= -1.

Cell 9 at (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)

If (2,-1,-1), y= -1, same as cell 2.

If (2,-2,0), y= -2, different.

Also, in the row, it should be continuous, but in diagram, it's shown as 2 then 9, so likely adjacent in the row, so probably same y or same x, but in hex grid, in a row, cells have constant y or constant x.

In this case, for middle row, cells have constant y? Cell 1: (0,0,0), y=0; cell 2: (1,-1,0), y= -1; cell 5: (-1,1,0), y=1; so not constant y.

Constant x? No.

Perhaps the "row" is defined by the direction, but for the purpose, since it's a straight line in the diagram, but in coordinates, it's a zigzag, but for adjacency in the path, we don't care.

But for cell 9, it should be adjacent to cell 8 and to cell 2 or not necessarily, but in the path, it only needs to be adjacent to cell 8.

From the diagram, after 8, it goes to 9, and 9 is not necessarily adjacent to 2, but in the diagram, it is shown next to 2, so probably adjacent or close.

In the middle row: 15,5,1,2,9, so cells 5,1,2,9 are in sequence, so likely 2 and 9 are adjacent.

Cell 2 at (1,-1,0), cell 9 at say (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)

Distance to cell 2: if (2,-1,-1), |2-1| + |-1+1| + |-1-0| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

If (2,-2,0), |2-1| + |-2+1| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent.

So not adjacent to cell 2. But in the diagram, it is next to it in the row, so probably they are adjacent, meaning that in the hex grid, cells in the same "row" are adjacent if consecutive.

In a hexagonal grid with pointy tops, in a row, consecutive cells are adjacent.

For example, in middle row, cells are at positions with constant r in axial coordinates, or constant y in cube.

In cube coordinates, for a fixed y, the cells have different x,z.

For example, for y=0: cell 1: (0,0,0), cell 2: (1,0,-1)? But earlier we have cell 2 at (1,-1,0), y= -1.

Perhaps for the row, it's defined by the value of x+y or x+z.

For middle row, all cells have y=0 in some system, but in our cube, cell 1: y=0, cell 2: y= -1, cell 5: y=1, so not.

Perhaps use axial coordinates with q and r.

Let q be the east-west, r be the north-south.

Then for cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: east: (1,0)

Cell 3: northeast: (1,1)  ? But then from (1,0) to (1,1), distance |1-1| + |0-1| =0+1=1, and |s1-s2| , s= -q- r, s1= -1-0= -1, s2= -1-1= -2, |s1-s2|=1, and max(|dq|,|dr|,|ds|) = max(0,1,1)=1, so yes, adjacent.

Cell 4: northwest: from (1,1), northwest is (0,2)? Or (0,1)? Northwest is (q-1,r+1) or (q,r+1)? Standard: in axial, the directions are:

- East: (q+1,r)

- West: (q-1,r)

- Northeast: (q,r+1)

- Northwest: (q-1,r+1)

- Southeast: (q,r-1)

- Southwest: (q-1,r-1) or something. Let's check.

From (0,0):

- East: (1,0)

- Northeast: (0,1) or (1,1)? If (0,1), then distance |0-0| + |1-0| =0+1=1, s1=0, s2= -0-1= -1, |s2-s1|=1, max(0,1,1)=1, good.

- Northwest: ( -1,1) or (0,1) but (0,1) is northeast.

Northwest should be left and up, so ( -1,1)

Distance | -1-0| + |1-0| =1+1=2, max(1,1,2)=2, not adjacent. Wrong.

In axial coordinates, the neighbors are:

 (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1) ? Let's see from (0,0):

 (1,0): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1 (since s= -q-r, ds= -1-0= -1), |dq|+ |dr| + |ds| =1+0+1=2, not 1. I think I have a mistake.

In cube coordinates, it's better.

Perhaps for this spiral, the cells are placed in a specific order, and I can find the coordinates by the ring and the side.

For ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are: let's say side 0: east, side 1: northeast, side 2: northwest, side 3: west, side 4: southwest, side 5: southeast.

For ring 1: k=1, cells: 2 on east, 3 on northeast, 4 on northwest, 5 on west, 6 on southwest, 7 on southeast.

For ring 2: k=2, each side has 2 cells.

The first cell of the ring is on the southeast side, since it's adjacent to the last cell of previous ring, which is on southeast.

In ring 1, cell 7 is on southeast.

Then ring 2 starts with 8 on southeast side.

Then it goes to the next side, which is east, then northeast, etc.

So for side s, the cells are placed in order.

For ring 2, side 5: southeast, cells 8 and 9? But 8 and 9 are on the same side? But in the path, from 8 to 9, if on the same side, they should be adjacent along the side.

Then from 9 to 10, which should be on the next side, east.

In the diagram, 8 is southeast, 9 is east, etc.

From 7 to 8: 7 is southeast of center, 8 is southeast of that, but in the grid, it might be at the corner.

Typically, for a side, the cells are along a straight line.

For example, for the southeast side of ring k, the cells are at positions like from the corner.

For ring k, the cells are at distance k from center.

In cube coordinates, the distance from center is (|x| + |y| + |z|)/2, and for ring k, distance k.

For cell in ring k, max(|x|,|y|,|z|) = k, and |x|+ |y| + |z| = 2k, since distance is (|x|+|y|+|z|)/2 = k.

For example, ring 0: (0,0,0), distance 0.

Ring 1: cells like (1,-1,0), |1|+|-1|+|0| =2, distance 1.

Yes.

Now for ring k, the cells are on the "layer" at distance k.

The spiral path starts at the southeast side for each ring, but for ring 1, it started at east, not southeast.

For ring 1, it started at east (cell 2), then northeast (3), northwest (4), west (5), southwest (6), southeast (7).

So it ends at southeast.

Then for the next ring, it starts at the cell adjacent to the last cell and in the southeast direction or something.

In general, for ring k, it starts at the cell on the southeast side, at the "start" position.

Then it goes along the southeast side to the end, then to the east side, and so on, but in which order.

From the sequence, for ring 2: cells 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19

From diagram and sequence, 8 is at southeast, then 9 is next on the same side or next side.

From 8 to 9: in diagram, from lower row to middle row, so probably not on the same side; likely on the next cell in the path.

Typically, it goes along each side in order, but for each side, it may have multiple cells.

For a side with k cells, it places them in order along the side.

For ring 2, southeast side has 2 cells: say 8 and 9.

Then east side: 10 and 11, northeast: 12 and 13, northwest: 14 and 15, west: 16 and 17, southwest: 18 and 19.

But in the diagram, after 8 is 9, then 10, so if 8 and 9 are both on southeast, then from 9 to 10 should be to east side.

In the diagram, 9 is in middle row, 10 in upper row, so likely 9 is the last of southeast, 10 is first of east.

And in the diagram, 10 is to the right of 3, and 3 is northeast of center, so east side might be to the east of northeast.

Let's verify with numbers.

Cell 8: southeast, cell 9: also southeast or next.

From cell 7 to 8: adjacent, both on or near southeast.

Cell 8 to 9: adjacent.

Cell 9 to 10: adjacent.

In the grid, if 8 and 9 are on the southeast side, for ring 2, the southeast side cells are at positions like (0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1) or something.

Let's calculate the coordinates for ring 2 cells.

The southeast side: southeast direction is (0,-1,1), so for distance 2, cells with high z, low y.

The cells on the southeast side are those with the southeast corner, which is in the direction of the vector, but for the side, it's a ray.

For example, for ring 2, the cell at the southeast corner is at 2* (0,-1,1) / something, but since distance 2, the corner cell is at (0,-2,2)

Then the other cells on the side are at (1,-2,1) and ( -1,-1,2), but ( -1,-1,2) is southwest or something.

Typically, for the southeast side, cells have z > |x|, z > |y|, or something.

The cells where the southeast direction is dominant.

For cell on southeast side of ring k, it has z = k, and x and y negative or something.

For example, in ring 1, southeast cell is 7 at (0,-1,1), so z=1, x=0, y= -1.

For ring 2, southeast cells: likely (0,-2,2), and (1,-2,1) or ( -1,-1,2) or (0,-1,1) but occupied.

(0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1) both have distance 2: |0|+|-2|+|2|=4, distance 2; |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, distance 2.

And they are adjacent: distance between (0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1): |0-1| + |-2+2| + |2-1| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent. Oh.

(0,-2,2) and (-1,-1,2): |0+1| + |-2+1| + |2-2| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent.

(0,-2,2) and (0,-1,1): |0-0| + |-2+1| + |2-1| =0+1+1=2, not adjacent, and occupied.

So not adjacent to each other or to previous.

Perhaps the cells on a side are not all adjacent to each other; in a side with k cells, they are in a path, so consecutive on the side are adjacent, but not necessarily all.

For example, for ring 2, southeast side: cells at (0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1), and they are not adjacent, so cannot be on the same side for a path.

So probably not.

Perhaps the side is in a different direction.

For the southeast side, it might be along the southeast direction, so cells like (0,-2,2), (0,-3,3), but that's for higher rings.

For a given ring, the cells on a side are at the same "angle".

Perhaps use a different approach.

I recall that in such hexagonal spirals, the number at position (x,y) can be found, or vice versa.

There are formulas for the spiral number.

I am considering the ring and the sector.

For a number n, find which ring k it is in, as we did.

Then the first number in ring k is f(k) = 3k(k-1) +2 for k≥1? Let's see.

For k=1, f(1) = 2

k=2, f(2) = 8

k=3, f(3) = 3*3*2 +2 = 18+2=20, but earlier T(2)=19, so first of ring 3 is 20, yes.

General: first number of ring k is T(k-1) +1 = 3(k-1)k +1 +1 = 3k(k-1) +2

Yes.

Then the number of cells in the ring is 6k.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are ordered, and the first side is the southeast side, since it starts there for k≥2, but for k=1, it started at east, so perhaps for k≥2, it starts at southeast, for k=1 at east.

For consistency, we can say that the starting point is the cell in the direction of the last cell of previous ring.

For ring k, it starts at the cell that is in the same direction as the first cell of ring 1 or something.

From the sequence, for ring 2, it starts at 8, which is in the southeast direction from center, but at distance 2.

Cell 7 is at (0,-1,1), which is southeast.

Cell 8 is at (0,-2,2) or (1,-2,1), but let's assume (0,-2,2) for the corner.

Then from there, it goes to the next cell on the side. Since it's a corner, and only one cell for k=1, but for k=2, two cells, so it might go to (1,-2,1) or to ( -1,-1,2), but likely to (1,-2,1) if it's continuing the path.

From (0,-2,2) to (1,-2,1), as we had, and they are not adjacent, so perhaps it goes to (0,-1,1) but occupied, or to (1,-1,0) occupied.

Perhaps it goes in a different direction.

Perhaps for the side, the cells are placed in a line, but not radially, but along the edge.

From the cell at the corner, it goes along the side to the next corner.

For example, from southeast corner of ring 2, to the east corner, but the east corner is at (2,-1,-1) or something.

Let's define the corner cells for each ring.

For ring k, the corner cells are at the six directions: east: (k, -k, 0), but distance |k|+|-k|+|0|=2k, distance k, good.

Northeast: (k,0,-k)

Northwest: (0,k,-k)

West: (-k,k,0)

Southwest: (-k,0,k)

Southeast: (0,-k,k)

For k=1: east: (1,-1,0) = cell 2, good.

NE: (1,0,-1) = cell 3, good.

NW: (0,1,-1) = cell 4, good.

W: (-1,1,0) = cell 5, good.

SW: (-1,0,1) = cell 6, good.

SE: (0,-1,1) = cell 7, good.

For ring 2: corners: E: (2,-2,0), NE: (2,0,-2), NW: (0,2,-2), W: (-2,2,0), SW: (-2,0,2), SE: (0,-2,2)

Now, the cells on the sides between corners.

For example, on the southeast side, between SE corner and E corner.

SE corner: (0,-2,2), E corner: (2,-2,0)

The cells on the line between them. In hex grid, the cells at distance 2 with high z.

The cells on the southeast side might be those with z=2, or something, but for ring 2, cells with |x|,|y|,|z| <=2, sum 4, and on the southeast part.

The cells between (0,-2,2) and (2,-2,0) are (1,-2,1) and perhaps others, but (1,-2,1) is one.

And (0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1) are adjacent? Distance |0-1| + |-2+2| + |2-1| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

 (0,-2,2) and (2,-2,0) are not adjacent.

To have a path, the cells on the side should be adjacent to each other.

For the southeast side, cells: (0,-2,2), then (1,-2,1), then (2,-2,0) but (2,-2,0) is the east corner.

But (0,-2,2) and (1,-2,1) are not adjacent, as distance 2.

So not.

Perhaps the side includes cells like (0,-2,2), (0,-1,1), but (0,-1,1) is in ring 1, already occupied.

So for ring k, the cells are only at distance exactly k, so cannot include distance k-1.

Therefore, on a side, the cells may not be all adjacent if k>1; only for k=1 they are corners and adjacent to center.

For k>1, on a side with k cells, they are not all adjacent to each other; the side is not a straight line in terms of adjacency; it's a sequence where each is adjacent to the next, but not necessarily in a straight line.

For example, for ring 2, southeast side: cells 8 and 9.

Cell 8 at (0,-2,2), cell 9 at (1,-2,1) or ( -1,-1,2)

If cell 8 at (0,-2,2), cell 9 at (1,-2,1), then distance 2, not adjacent, so not good.

Cell 8 at (0,-2,2), cell 9 at (0,-1,1) but occupied.

Or cell 8 at (1,-2,1), cell 9 at (0,-2,2) or (2,-2,0) or (1,-1,0) etc.

Suppose cell 8 at (1,-2,1), cell 9 at (2,-2,0) or (1,-1,0) or (0,-2,1) etc.

If (2,-2,0), distance |1-2| + |-2+2| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

If (1,-1,0), distance |1-1| + |-2+1| + |1-0| =0+1+1=2, not adjacent.

If (0,-2,1), distance |1-0| + |-2+2| + |1-1| =1+0+0=1, adjacent! Good.

So cell 8 at (1,-2,1), cell 9 at (0,-2,1)? (0,-2,1), sum 0-2+1= -1≠0, not on plane.

(0,-2,1) sum -1, not 0.

 (0,-1,1) is cell 7, sum 0.

 ( -1,-1,2) sum -1-1+2=0, good, and distance to (1,-2,1): | -1-1| + | -1+2| + |2-1| =2+1+1=4, not adjacent.

 (0,-3,3) sum 0-3+3=0, distance |1-0| + |-2+3| + |1-3| =1+1+2=4, not.

So no adjacent cell with sum 0 at distance 1 from (1,-2,1) except the ones we listed, and they are not on the plane or not adjacent.

The neighbors are only the six directions, all at distance 1, and for (1,-2,1), they are (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

All have sum 0? (2,-2,0):2-2+0=0, (2,-1,-1):2-1-1=0, (1,-1,0):1-1+0=0, (0,-2,1):0-2+1= -1≠0, (0,-1,0):0-1+0= -1≠0, (1,-3,2):1-3+2=0.

So neighbors are (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

 (1,-1,0) is cell 2, occupied.

So unoccupied: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-3,2)

All at distance 1 from center? (2,-2,0): |2|+|-2|+|0|=4, distance 2, good for ring 2.

Similarly others.

So cell 8 at (1,-2,1), then cell 9 could be at (2,-2,0) or (2,-1,-1) or (1,-3,2)

Now in the diagram, cell 9 is in middle row, which has z=0 for some cells, but (2,-2,0) z=0, (2,-1,-1) z= -1, (1,-3,2) z=2.

Cell 2 is at (1,-1,0), z=0, and in middle row, so likely cell 9 also in middle row, so z=0, so (2,-2,0)

Then cell 10 in upper row, z= -1, and to the right of 3, 3 at (1,0,-1), z= -1.

So cell 10 at (2,0,-2) or (2,-1,-1) or etc.

If cell 9 at (2,-2,0), then to cell 10, must be adjacent, so neighbors of (2,-2,0): (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,0), (1,-1,-1), (2,-3,1)

With sum 0: all should have sum 0, (3,-2,-1):3-2-1=0, (3,-1,-2):3-1-2=0, (2,-1,-1):2-1-1=0, (1,-2,0):1-2+0= -1≠0, (1,-1,-1):1-1-1= -1≠0, (2,-3,1):2-3+1=0.

So possible: (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,-1,-1), (2,-3,1)

Cell 10 in upper row, z= -1, so (3,-2,-1) z= -1, (3,-1,-2) z= -2, (2,-1,-1) z= -1, (2,-3,1) z=1.

So possible (3,-2,-1) or (2,-1,-1)

In diagram, to the right of 3 (1,0,-1), so if "right" means increase x, so (2,0,-2) or (2,-1,-1) etc.

(2,-1,-1) is a possibility, and it is adjacent to 3? Cell 3 at (1,0,-1), distance to (2,-1,-1): |1-2| + |0+1| + |-1+1| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent.

(3,-2,-1) distance to (1,0,-1): |3-1| + |-2-0| + |-1+1| =2+2+0=4, not adjacent.

So not adjacent to 3, but in the diagram, it is shown next to 3 in the row, so probably it is adjacent.

Perhaps cell 10 at (2,0,-2), but is it a neighbor of cell 9? Cell 9 at (2,-2,0), distance to (2,0,-2): |2-2| + |-2-0| + |0+2| =0+2+2=4, not adjacent.

So not.

Perhaps cell 8 is at (0,-2,2)

Then neighbors: (1,-2,1), (-1,-2,3), (0,-1,1), (0,-3,3), (1,-3,2), (-1,-1,2)

Sum 0: (1,-2,1):1-2+1=0, (-1,-2,3):-1-2+3=0, (0,-1,1):0-1+1=0 but occupied, (0,-3,3):0-3+3=0, (1,-3,2):1-3+2=0, (-1,-1,2):-1-1+2=0.

So unoccupied: (1,-2,1), (-1,-2,3), (0,-3,3), (1,-3,2), (-1,-1,2)

All distance 2.

Then cell 9, in middle row, z=0, so none have z=0; all have z=1,2,3, not 0.

(1,-2,1) z=1, etc.

So not in middle row.

So not.

Perhaps for cell 9, it is not in the same "row" as cell 2 in terms of z, but in the diagram it is in the middle row, so must have the same row attribute.

Perhaps the row is defined by x+y.

For lower row, x+y= -1, as earlier.

Cell 8 in lower row, so x+y= -1.

Cell 8 at (1,-2,1), x+y=1-2= -1, good.

Cell 9 in middle row, x+y=0.

So cell 9 must have x+y=0.

From neighbors of cell 8: (2,-2,0):2-2=0, good; (2,-1,-1):2-1=1, not 0; (1,-1,0):1-1=0, but occupied; (1,-3,2):1-3= -2, not 0.

So only (2,-2,0) has x+y=0.

So cell 9 at (2,-2,0)

Then cell 10 in upper row, x+y=1, as cell 3 and 4 have x+y=1.

Cell 10 must have x+y=1, and be adjacent to cell 9 (2,-2,0)

Neighbors of (2,-2,0): as above, (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,0), (1,-1,-1), (2,-3,1)

x+y: (3,-2,-1):3-2=1, good; (3,-1,-2):3-1=2, not; (2,-1,-1):2-1=1, good; (1,-2,0):1-2= -1, not; (1,-1,-1):1-1=0, not; (2,-3,1):2-3= -1, not.

So possible (3,-2,-1) or (2,-1,-1)

Now in diagram, to the right of 3 (1,0,-1), x+y=1+0=1, good.

"Right" likely means increase x, so (2,0,-2) or (3,0,-3) etc, but among, (2,-1,-1) x=2, (3,-2,-1) x=3, cell 3 x=1, so both have x>1.

But which one is adjacent to cell 3? Cell 3 at (1,0,-1)

Distance to (2,-1,-1): |2-1| + |-1-0| + |-1+1| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent.

To (3,-2,-1): |3-1| + |-2-0| + |-1+1| =2+2+0=4, not adjacent.

But in the diagram, it is next to 3, so probably adjacent, so must be adjacent to cell 3.

So perhaps cell 10 is at (2,0,-2) or (1,1,-2) etc.

(2,0,-2): x+y=2+0=2, not 1, not in upper row.

(1,1,-2): x+y=2, not 1.

(0,1,-1) occupied.

(2,0,-2) not sum 1.

The cells with x+y=1 and distance 2: (2,-1,-1), (3,-2,-1), (1,0,-1) occupied, (0,1,-1) occupied, ( -1,2,-1), etc.

None are adjacent to cell 3 (1,0,-1) except itself.

(1,0,-1) is cell 3, so no other cell on the same point.

So perhaps cell 10 is not adjacent to cell 3, but in the diagram it is shown in the same row and next to it, so in the hex grid, in the row, cells are not necessarily adjacent if not consecutive, but in this case, in the upper row, cells 4,3,10, so probably 3 and 10 are adjacent.

Cell 4 at (0,1,-1), cell 3 at (1,0,-1), distance |0-1| + |1-0| + |-1+1| =1+1+0=2, not adjacent, but in the diagram, they are next to each other in the row, so in the hex grid, they should be adjacent if in the same row and consecutive.

For cell 3 and 4: (1,0,-1) and (0,1,-1), distance 2, not adjacent, but they are both neighbors of cell 1, so they are not adjacent to each other; in a hexagonal grid, cells that are both adjacent to a common cell are not necessarily adjacent to each other; in fact, for hex grid, the angle is 60 degrees, so cells at 120 degrees are not adjacent.

In the grid, cell 3 and 4 are not adjacent; they are separated by cell 1.

In the diagram, in the upper row, it's shown as 14,4,3,10, so probably 4 and 3 are not adjacent; there might be cells in between, but in ring 1, only these, so perhaps the row is not a straight line, or in the diagram, it's shown with cells not adjacent, but for the purpose of the path, we only care about the spiral path adjacency.

For the neighbor sum, I need the six adjacent cells, so I need the grid position.

Perhaps for the spiral, the cells are placed in order, and I can find the coordinates by simulating or by formula.

I recall that for hexagonal spiral, the number at (x,y,z) can be found, or vice versa.

Perhaps use the ring and the arc length.

For number n in ring k, with first number f = 3k(k-1) +2

Then the index in the ring i = n - f

Then i ranges from 0 to 6k-1.

Then the side s = floor(i / k)

Then the position on the side p = i mod k

Then the cell is at a position based on s and p.

For example, for k=2, f=8, i=0 for n=8, s = floor(0/2)=0, p=0

i=1, s= floor(1/2)=0, p=1

i=2, s=1, p=0

i=3, s=1, p=1

etc.

Now what is s=0: southeast side.

s=1: east side, etc.

For s=0, p=0: cell 8 at the start of southeast side.

p=1: cell 9 at the end of southeast side.

Then s=1, p=0: cell 10 at start of east side, etc.

Now for cell 8 and 9 on southeast side, they should be adjacent.

Assume cell 8 at the southeast corner: (0,-2,2)

Then cell 9 at the next cell on the side, which might be (1,-2,1) or (0,-1,1) but occupied, or ( -1,-1,2)

Suppose cell 8 at (0,-2,2)

Cell 9 at (1,-2,1) , but not adjacent.

Cell 9 at (0,-3,3) , but distance |0|+|-3|+|3|=6, distance 3, not in ring 2.

So not.

Perhaps the start is not at the corner.

For example, for ring 2, the first cell 8 is not at the corner, but at a different position.

In the diagram, cell 8 is not at the corner; cell 16 or 19 is at corner.

For example, cell 16 in lower row, might be southwest corner.

So perhaps for each side, the cells are placed from the "inner" end to the "outer" end or vice versa.

For the southeast side, it starts at the cell adjacent to the previous ring, which is cell 7 at (0,-1,1), so adjacent cells at distance 2: as before, (1,-2,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2), etc.

Suppose cell 8 at (1,-2,1) , adjacent to cell 7 (0,-1,1) , distance |1-0| + |-2+1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, not 1, not adjacent.

To be adjacent, must be at distance 1, but at distance 1 from cell 7 are cells at distance 1 or 2 from center, but distance 1 cells are occupied, distance 2 cells are at distance 2 from cell 7.

From cell 7 (0,-1,1), neighbors are at distance 1 from it, which may have distance 1 or 2 from center.

For example, (1,-2,1): distance from center |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, distance 2, and distance from 7: |1-0| + |-2+1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, not 1.

The distance in the grid is the shortest path, so if not adjacent, distance at least 2.

To be adjacent, the cell must share a side, so distance 1 in the grid metric.

From cell 7 (0,-1,1), the adjacent cells are:
 (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,0,0), (-1,0,1), (-1,-1,2), (0,-2,2)

As before.

 (1,-1,0) = cell 2, distance from center 1, occupied.

 (1,0,-1) = cell 3, distance 1, occupied.

 (0,0,0) = cell 1, distance 0, occupied.

 (-1,0,1) = cell 6, distance 1, occupied.

 (-1,-1,2): sum -1-1+2=0, distance | -1|+|-1|+|2|=4, distance 2 from center, unoccupied.

 (0,-2,2): sum 0-2+2=0, distance 2, unoccupied.

So only two choices: (-1,-1,2) or (0,-2,2)

In the diagram, cell 8 is to the east of 7, and in the same row, so likely (0,-2,2) or (-1,-1,2)

If (0,-2,2), then y= -2, cell 7 y= -1, not same.

Cell 7 (0,-1,1), so if "row" is constant z, z=1 for both, cell 8 should have z=1, so ( -1,-1,2) has z=2, not 1; (0,-2,2) z=2, not 1.

So not in the same row in terms of z.

If "row" is constant x+y, cell 7 x+y=0-1= -1, cell 8 should have x+y= -1, so ( -1,-1,2): -1-1= -2, not -1; (0,-2,2):0-2= -2, not -1.

So not.

Therefore, cell 8 is not in the same row as cell 7 in the diagram sense for the lower row; but in the diagram, it is in the lower row with 6 and 7, so it must have the same row attribute.

Perhaps for the lower row, the cells have the same r in axial coordinates.

Let's define axial coordinates q,r.

Let q be the x-coordinate, r be the y-coordinate.

Then s = -q - r.

Distance max(|dq|,|dr|,|ds|).

Cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: east: (1,0)

Cell 3: northeast: (0,1) or (1,1)? If (0,1), then from (1,0) to (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds= -(-1)-1=0-1= -1, | -1|,|1|,| -1|, max 1, distance 1, good.

Cell 4: northwest: from (0,1), northwest might be (-1,2) or (-1,1) or (0,2)

If to (-1,1), dq= -1, dr=0, ds= -(-1)-1=1-1=0, | -1|,|0|,|0|, max 1, distance 1, good.

Cell 5: west: from (-1,1), west to (-2,1) or (-2,0) or (-1,0)

If to (-2,1), dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 6: southwest: to (-2,0) or (-1,0) or (-2,-1) etc.

If to (-2,0), dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 7: southeast: from (-2,0), to (-1,0) or (-1,-1) or (-2,-1)

If to (-1,0), dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1, max 1, good.

But (-1,0) might be cell 2 or something, cell 2 is at (1,0), different.

Cell 7 should be at a new cell, so say (-2,-1) or (-1,-1)

If to (-2,-1), from (-2,0), dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, max 1, good.

Sum s= -q- r = -(-2)-(-1) =2+1=3, not 0, but in axial, the sum q+r+s=0, s= -q- r, so q+r+ (-q- r) =0, always, so no constraint, but the cells are not on a lattice with sum 0; in axial coordinates, the cells are at all integer (q,r), and the distance is max(|dq|,|dr|,|ds|) with ds = -dq-dr, so |ds| = |dq+dr|, so it's not the same as cube.

In this case, cell 7 at (-2,-1), s= -(-2)-(-1) =2+1=3, distance from center: max(|-2|,|-1|,|3|) =3, not 1. So not in ring 1.

So not good.

Start over.

From cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: (1,0)  // east

Cell 3: from (1,0), go northeast, which is (1,1) or (2,1) or (1,0) to (2,0) but that's east.

Northeast is (q,r+1) or (q+1,r+1)

If (1,1), then from (1,0) to (1,1): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -0-1= -1, |0|,|1|,|1|, max 1, good.

Cell 4: northwest from (1,1), to (0,2) or (0,1) or (1,2)

If to (0,2), dq= -1, dr=1, ds= -(-1)-1=1-1=0, max 1, good.

Cell 5: west from (0,2), to (-1,2) or (-1,1) or (0,1)

If to (-1,2), dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 6: southwest from (-1,2), to (-1,1) or (-2,2) or (-2,1) or (-1,1)

If to (-1,1), dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, max 1, good.

But (-1,1) might be cell 4 or something.

Cell 6 at (-1,1), but cell 4 is at (0,2), cell 5 at (-1,2), so (-1,1) is new.

Cell 7: southeast from (-1,1), to (0,1) or (0,0) or (-1,0) or (0,2) etc.

If to (0,1), dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1, max 1, good.

But (0,1) is not occupied; cell 3 is at (1,1), cell 4 at (0,2), so (0,1) is free.

So cell 7 at (0,1)

Then ring 1 cells: (1,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1), (0,1) — but (0,1) is cell 7, and cell 1 at (0,0), so all good, and distance from center: for (0,1): max(|0|,|1|,| -0-1|=1) =1, good.

Now for cell 8: from cell 7 (0,1), go to next ring. In which direction? In the spiral, it might continue southeast or turn.

In diagram, it goes east, so perhaps to (1,1) but occupied by cell 3.

To (0,0) occupied.

To (-1,1) occupied by cell 6.

So must go to a new cell, say (1,2) or (0,2) occupied, or (-1,0) or (0,0) etc.

Neighbors of (0,1): (1,1) occupied, ( -1,1) occupied, (0,2) occupied, (0,0) occupied, (1,0) occupied, ( -1,0) , (0,1) itself, so only ( -1,0) is free.

So cell 8 at (-1,0)

Then in diagram, it is in lower row, and cell 7 is in upper row or what.

Cell 7 at (0,1), which might be upper row, cell 8 at (-1,0), which might be middle or lower.

Cell 6 at (-1,1), cell 5 at (-1,2), etc.

Then cell 9: from 8 (-1,0), to 9, which in diagram is in middle row, to the right of 2.

Cell 2 at (1,0), so to the right might be (2,0) or (1,1) occupied.

So say (2,0)

But is it adjacent to 8? From (-1,0) to (2,0): dq=3, dr=0, ds= -3, max 3, not 1.

So not adjacent.

From 8 (-1,0), neighbors: (0,0) occupied, (-2,0), (-1,1) occupied, (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-2,1), etc.

So ( -2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), etc.

Then to cell 9, say (0,-1) or (-1,-1) or (-2,0)

In middle row, cell 2 at (1,0), so perhaps (0,0) occupied, or (0,1) occupied, or ( -1,0) occupied, so not.

This is taking too long.

Perhaps for the problem, since I need the neighbors of 2026, and it's in ring 26, I can find its position and then its neighbors.

For a number n in ring k, with i = n - f, f=3k(k-1)+2

Then the side s = floor(i / k)

Then the position on the side p = i mod k

Then the cell is at a relative position.

For example, for ring k, the cell at side s, position p.

Then the coordinates can be given by:

The corner cells are at s=0, p=0 for each side, but since there are 6 sides, s from 0 to 5.

For s=0: southeast side

s=1: east side

s=2: northeast side
s=3: northwest side
s=4: west side
s=5: southwest side

For each side, the cells are at p=0 to k-1, with p=0 at the "start" and p=k-1 at the "end".

The start for s=0 is at the cell adjacent to the last cell of previous ring.

For example, for k=2, f=8, i=0: s= floor(0/2)=0, p=0: cell 8 on southeast side, start.

i=1: s=0, p=1: cell 9 on southeast side, end.

i=2: s= floor(2/2)=1, p=0: cell 10 on east side, start.

i=3: s=1, p=1: cell 11 on east side, end.

i=4: s=2, p=0: cell 12 on northeast side, start.

i=5: s=2, p=1: cell 13 on northeast side, end.

i=6: s=3, p=0: cell 14 on northwest side, start.

i=7: s=3, p=1: cell 15 on northwest side, end.

i=8: s=4, p=0: cell 16 on west side, start.

i=9: s=4, p=1: cell 17 on west side, end.

i=10: s=5, p=0: cell 18 on southwest side, start.

i=11: s=5, p=1: cell 19 on southwest side, end.

Now in the diagram, cell 8 in lower row, cell 9 in middle row, cell 10 in upper row, etc, which matches.

Now for the coordinates, for a given s and p, the cell is at a specific (x,y,z) or (q,r).

For southeast side s=0, the cells are at (0, -k, k) for p=0? But for k=2, (0,-2,2)

Then for p=1, perhaps (1,-2,1) or ( -1,-1,2) etc.

But earlier not adjacent.

Perhaps for s=0, the cells are at (p, -k, k-p) or something.

For example, for k=2, s=0, p=0: (0, -2, 2)

p=1: (1, -2, 1) or (0, -3, 3) but distance 3.

Or ( -1, -2, 3) etc.

Assume (p, -k, k-p) for s=0.

For p=0: (0, -2, 2)

p=1: (1, -2, 1)

Then distance between them: |0-1| + |-2+2| + |2-1| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

 (p, -k-p, k) : p=0: (0,-2,2), p=1: (1,-3,2), distance |0-1| + |-2+3| + |2-2| =1+1+0=2, not.

 (k-p, -k, p) : p=0: (2,-2,0), p=1: (1,-2,1)

Distance |2-1| + |-2+2| + |0-1| =1+0+1=2, not.

Perhaps not in cube coordinates.

In axial, for s=0, cells at (q,r) = (p, -k) or something.

For k=2, s=0, p=0: (0, -2)

p=1: (1, -2) or (0, -3) etc.

Distance from center: for (0,-2): max(|0|,|-2|,|2|) =2, good.

For (1,-2): max(|1|,|-2|,|1|) =2, good.

Distance between (0,-2) and (1,-2): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1-0= -1, |1|,|0|,|1|, max 1, so adjacent! Good.

So in axial coordinates, for southeast side s=0, cells at (q,r) = (p, -k)

For p=0: (0,-2), p=1: (1,-2)

Then for east side s=1, cells at (k, -k + p) or something.

For cell 10: s=1, p=0: start of east side.

Should be at (2, -2) or (2, -1) etc.

In the grid, from cell 9 at (1,-2), to cell 10, should be adjacent, and cell 10 on east side.

Also, in diagram, in upper row, and to the right of 3, cell 3 at (1,1) in axial? Earlier for cell 3: (1,1)? In our axial, cell 1: (0,0), cell 2: (1,0), cell 3: (1,1), cell 4: (0,2), cell 5: (-1,2), cell 6: (-1,1), cell 7: (0,1)

So cell 3 at (1,1)

Cell 10 at say (2,-1) or (2,0) etc.

If cell 10 at (2,-1), then distance to cell 9 (1,-2): dq=1, dr=1, ds= -1-1= -2, |1|,|1|,|2|, max 2, not adjacent.

Cell 10 at (2,0), distance to (1,-2): dq=1, dr=2, ds= -1-2= -3, |1|,|2|,|3|, max 3, not.

Cell 10 at (1,-1), but may be occupied or not; cell 7 at (0,1), cell 2 at (1,0), so (1,-1) is free, distance to (1,-2): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -0-1= -1, |0|,|1|,|1|, max 1, adjacent.

And x+y for upper row should be 1, cell 3 at (1,1), q+r=2, not 1; earlier we had x+y=1 for upper row, but in axial, it may be different.

Cell 10 at (1,-1), q+r=1-1=0, not 1.

Cell 3 at (1,1), q+r=2.

So perhaps not.

For s=1, east side, cells at (k, -k + p)

For k=2, p=0: (2, -2)

p=1: (2, -1)

Then cell 9 at (1,-2) for s=0 p=1

Cell 10 at (2,-2) for s=1 p=0

Distance between (1,-2) and (2,-2): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1-0= -1, |1|,|0|,|1|, max 1, adjacent. Good.

Cell 11 at (2,-1) for s=1 p=1

Distance to cell 10 (2,-2): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -0-1= -1, |0|,|1|,|1|, max 1, adjacent. Good.

Then cell 12: s=2, northeast side, p=0: say (2,0) or (2,1) etc.

Should be adjacent to cell 11 (2,-1)

Say (2,0), distance dq=0, dr=1, ds= -0-1= -1, max 1, good.

Or (3,-1), etc.

In diagram, in upper row, cell 3 at (1,1), so perhaps (2,0) or (2,1)

Cell 12 at (2,0), then cell 13 at (2,1) for p=1.

Then cell 14: s=3, northwest side, p=0: say (1,2) or (0,2) etc.

Adjacent to cell 13 (2,1), say (1,2), distance dq= -1, dr=1, ds= -(-1)-1=1-1=0, | -1|,|1|,|0|, max 1, good.

Cell 15 at (0,2) for p=1, distance to (1,2): dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 16: s=4, west side, p=0: say (-1,2) or (-2,2) etc.

Adjacent to cell 15 (0,2), say (-1,2), distance dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 17 at (-2,2) for p=1, distance to (-1,2): dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 18: s=5, southwest side, p=0: say (-2,1) or (-2,0) etc.

Adjacent to cell 17 (-2,2), say (-2,1), distance dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, max 1, good.

Cell 19 at (-2,0) for p=1, distance to (-2,1): dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, max 1, good.

Now check the diagram.

Cell 8: s=0 p=0: (0,-2)

Cell 9: s=0 p=1: (1,-2)

Cell 10: s=1 p=0: (2,-2)

Cell 11: s=1 p=1: (2,-1)

Cell 12: s=2 p=0: (2,0)

Cell 13: s=2 p=1: (2,1)

Cell 14: s=3 p=0: (1,2)  // northwest start

Cell 15: s=3 p=1: (0,2)

Cell 16: s=4 p=0: (-1,2)

Cell 17: s=4 p=1: (-2,2)

Cell 18: s=5 p=0: (-2,1)

Cell 19: s=5 p=1: (-2,0)

Now in lower row: cell 6: (-1,1), cell 7: (0,1), cell 8: (0,-2) — not the same r or q.

But in the diagram, lower row has 16,6,7,8, so cell 16,6,7,8.

Cell 16: (-1,2), cell 6: (-1,1), cell 7: (0,1), cell 8: (0,-2) — not close.

Cell 16 is at (-1,2), which might be in upper left, not lower.

Perhaps the sides are ordered differently.

For s=0: southeast, but in the spiral, it starts at southeast, but in the grid, southeast is down-right.

Cell 8 at (0,-2), which is south, since r= -2.

Cell 9 at (1,-2), cell 10 at (2,-2), cell 11 at (2,-1), cell 12 at (2,0), etc, so it's moving east then north.

In the diagram, after cell 7 at (0,1), it goes to cell 8 at (0,-2), but are they adjacent? Distance between (0,1) and (0,-2): dq=0, dr= -3, ds=3, max 3, not 1, not adjacent, but in the spiral, they must be adjacent since consecutive numbers.

Cell 7 is 7, cell 8 is 8, so in the path, 7 and 8 are adjacent cells in the grid.

But in this coordinate, (0,1) and (0,-2) are not adjacent.

So must be that cell 8 is adjacent to cell 7.

From cell 7 (0,1), neighbors are (1,1) occupied, (-1,1) occupied, (0,2) occupied, (0,0) occupied, (1,0) occupied, (-1,0), and (0,1) itself.

So only (-1,0) is free.

So cell 8 at (-1,0)

Then cell 9 at say (0,-1) or (-1,-1) or (-2,0) etc.

Then cell 10, etc.

But then it may not match the side order.

Perhaps for the new ring, it starts at a cell adjacent to the last cell, so for cell 7 at (0,1), cell 8 at (-1,0) or ( -1,2) but ( -1,2) is cell 5, occupied, or (1,2) etc.

Say cell 8 at (-1,0)

Then cell 9 at a neighbor, say (0,-1) or (-1,-1) or (-2,0) or (-2,1) etc.

In diagram, in middle row, to the right of 2, cell 2 at (1,0), so perhaps (2,0) or (1,1) occupied.

So say cell 9 at (2,0), but distance to cell 8 (-1,0): dq=3, dr=0, ds= -3, max 3, not 1.

So not adjacent.

Cell 9 at (0,-1), then to cell 10 at (1,-1) or (0,-2) etc.

Then cell 10 at (1,-1), then it can be to the right of cell 3 if cell 3 is at (1,1), but (1,-1) and (1,1) are not close.

This is messy.

Perhaps accept that in axial coordinates, and for the spiral, the coordinates are as above, and for cell 7 and 8, they are not adjacent in the grid, but in the spiral path, they are not consecutive in the sense that between rings, it's not adjacent, but in this case, 7 and 8 are consecutive numbers, so must be adjacent.

Unless the first cell of the new ring is not adjacent to the last cell of previous ring, but in most spirals, it is.

In this case, from the diagram, cell 7 and 8 are adjacent, since in the lower row, next to each other.

In lower row: 16,6,7,8, so 6,7,8 are consecutive in the row, so adjacent.

Cell 6 and 7 adjacent, 7 and 8 adjacent.

Cell 6 at in our first cube: (-1,0,1), cell 7 at (0,-1,1), cell 8 at (1,-2,1) or (0,-2,2) etc.

If cell 6: (-1,0,1), cell 7: (0,-1,1), distance | -1-0| + |0+1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2, not 1, not adjacent in cube, but in the grid, they should be adjacent since both neighbors of cell 1.

In cube coordinates, cell 6 and cell 7: (-1,0,1) and (0,-1,1), the vector difference is (1,-1,0), which has norm |1|+|-1|+|0|=2, not 1, so not adjacent; the angle is 120 degrees, so not adjacent.

But in the diagram, they are shown as adjacent in the row, so perhaps in this grid, the cells are arranged with flat tops, not pointy tops.

In flat top hex grid, the neighbors are different.

In flat top, the rows are horizontal, and each row has cells offset.

For example, row y=0: cells at x even, say.

But for center at (0,0), then neighbors: left and right on same row, then above-left, above-right, below-left, below-right.

For example, cell at (0,0)

- right: (2,0) or (1,0)? Usually, in flat top, the x-coordinate may be doubled.

Assume that for a cell at (x,y), neighbors are (x±2,y), (x±1,y±1), but then distance not uniform.

Standard for flat top: cell at (x,y), with y integer, x integer, and for even y, x even, for odd y, x odd, or something.

But for simplicity, use offset.

From the diagram, in lower row: cells at y= -1, say cell A at x= -2, cell B at x=0, cell C at x=2, but in diagram it's 16,6,7,8, so probably not aligned.

Perhaps it's a diagonal row.

Perhaps for this problem, since I need the neighbors of 2026, and it's in ring 26, and each ring has cells that are all at distance k from center, and the neighbors are at distance k-1, k, or k+1.

For a cell in ring k, its six neighbors are: some in ring k-1, some in ring k, some in ring k+1.

In particular, for cells not on the corners, they may have two in ring k-1, two in ring k, two in ring k+1, but for corners, different.

For example, in ring 1, cell 2 at (1,-1,0), neighbors: as before, (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,0,-1), (0,-1,0), (0,0,-1), (1,-2,1) but some may not be occupied yet, but in general, at distance 1 or 2.

Specifically, for cell in ring k, the neighbors at distance k-1, k, k+1.

For cell 2: distance 1, neighbors at distance 0,1,2.

Cell 1 at (0,0,0) distance 0.

Cell 3 at (1,0,-1) distance 1.

Cell 8 at (1,-2,1) distance 2, etc.

In general, for a cell in ring k, it has exactly two neighbors in ring k-1 ( for k>0), two in ring k, and two in ring k+1, except for the very first cell or corners, but in this symmetric grid, probably for all non-corner cells, but for corners, may have only one in ring k-1 or something.

For example, cell 2 in ring 1: neighbors: let's list in cube coordinates.

Cell 2: (1,-1,0)

Neighbors:
 (2,-1,-1) distance |2|+|-1|+|-1|=4, distance 2
 (2,-2,0) distance 4, distance 2
 (1,0,-1) distance |1|+|0|+|-1|=2, distance 1 — cell 3
 (1,-2,1) distance |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, distance 2
 (0,-1,0) distance |0|+|-1|+|0|=1, distance 0.5? No, |0|+|-1|+|0|=1, but distance is (|x|+|y|+|z|)/2 =0.5, but must be integer, so not a cell.

The cells are only at integer distances, so the neighbors are only at the six directions.

So (1+1,-1,0-1) = (2,-1,-1)
 (1+1,-1-1,0) = (2,-2,0)
 (1,-1+1,0-1) = (1,0,-1)
 (1-1,-1,0+1) = (0,-1,1)
 (1,-1-1,0+1) = (1,-2,1)
 (1-1,-1+1,0) = (0,0,0) — cell 1

So neighbors are: (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,0,-1), (0,-1,1), (1,-2,1), (0,0,0)

Distances from center: (2,-1,-1): |2|+|-1|+|-1|=4, distance 2
 (2,-2,0):4, distance 2
 (1,0,-1):2, distance 1
 (0,-1,1):2, distance 1 — cell 7
 (1,-2,1):4, distance 2
 (0,0,0):0, distance 0

So for cell 2, neighbors are: cell 1 (dist 0), cell 3 (1,0,-1) dist 1, cell 7 (0,-1,1) dist 1, and three at dist 2: (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,-2,1)

So in ring 0,1,2: one in ring 0, two in ring 1, three in ring 2.

Not uniform.

For corner cells, it may be different.

Cell 2 is on the east corner for ring 1.

Similarly, for a cell in ring k, the number of neighbors in each ring depends on its position.

For the cell at 2026 in ring 26, I need to find its position in the ring, then its "type" (corner or edge), then its neighbors.

For ring k, the cell at index i in the ring.

i = n - f, f=3k(k-1)+2

Then s = floor(i / k)  // side index 0 to 5

 p = i mod k  // position on side 0 to k-1

Then if p = 0, it is a "corner" cell for that side, else it is an "edge" cell.

For a corner cell, it has fewer neighbors in ring k-1.

For example, in ring 1, all cells are corners, and each has one neighbor in ring 0 ( the center), two in ring 1 ( adjacent cells), and three in ring 2.

In general, for a corner cell in ring k, it has 1 neighbor in ring k-1, 2 in ring k, 3 in ring k+1.

For an edge cell (not corner), it has 2 neighbors in ring k-1, 2 in ring k, 2 in ring k+1.

For example, in ring 2, take cell 8: if s=0, p=0, corner.

Cell 9: s=0, p=1, also on the same side, but for k=2, p=1 is the end, which may be a corner or not.

In ring 2, the corners are at the six directions, so cell 8,10,12,14,16,18 might be corners, cell 9,11,13,15,17,19 might be edge cells.

For cell 9: in the diagram, it is not at corner; cell 8 at southeast corner, cell 9 at the cell before east corner.

So for cell 9, it is an edge cell, not corner.

So for edge cell, it should have 2 in ring 1, 2 in ring 2, 2 in ring 3.

For cell 8 corner, 1 in ring 1, 2 in ring 2, 3 in ring 3.

Let's verify with actual numbers.

Cell 8: assume at (0,-2,2) in cube, but earlier not used, or in axial.

Assume in cube, cell 8 at (0,-2,2)

Neighbors:
 (1,-2,1), (-1,-2,3), (0,-1,2), (0,-3,3), (1,-3,2), (-1,-1,2)

Distances: (1,-2,1): |1|+|-2|+|1|=4, dist 2
 (-1,-2,3):6, dist 3
 (0,-1,2):3, dist 1.5 not integer
 must have sum 0, so (1,-2,1): sum 1-2+1=0, dist 2
 (-1,-2,3): -1-2+3=0, dist 3
 (0,-1,2):0-1+2=1≠0
 (0,-3,3):0-3+3=0, dist 3
 (1,-3,2):1-3+2=0, dist 2
 (-1,-1,2):-1-1+2=0, dist 2

So neighbors: (1,-2,1) dist 2, (-1,-2,3) dist 3, (0,-3,3) dist 3, (1,-3,2) dist 2, (-1,-1,2) dist 2

So in ring 2,3: three in ring 2, two in ring 3, and one in ring 1? Cell 7 at (0,-1,1) dist 1, and is it adjacent? (0,-1,1) and (0,-2,2): |0-0| + |-1+2| + |1-2| =0+1+1=2, not adjacent.

So no neighbor in ring 1; only in ring 2 and 3.

But for corner cell, it should have a neighbor in ring k-1=1.

So not.

Perhaps cell 8 at (1,-2,1)

Neighbors: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-2,1), (0,-1,0), (1,-3,2)

Sum 0: (2,-2,0):0, dist 2
 (2,-1,-1):0, dist 2
 (1,-1,0):0, dist 1 — cell 2
 (0,-2,1):-1 not 0
 (0,-1,0):-1 not 0
 (1,-3,2):0, dist 2

So neighbors: (2,-2,0) dist 2, (2,-1,-1) dist 2, (1,-1,0) dist 1 (cell 2), (1,-3,2) dist 2

So one in ring 1 (cell 2), three in ring 2, one in ring 3? (1,-3,2) dist |1|+|-3|+|2|=6, dist 3.

So one in ring 1, three in ring 2, two in ring 3.

Close to the 1,2,3 for corner.

For cell 9 at (2,-2,0) say, then neighbors: (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,0), (1,-1,-1), (2,-3,1)

Sum 0: (3,-2,-1):0, dist 3
 (3,-1,-2):0, dist 3
 (2,-1,-1):0, dist 2
 (1,-2,0):-1 not
 (1,-1,-1):-1 not
 (2,-3,1):0, dist 3

So (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,-1,-1), (2,-3,1) all dist 3 or 2; (2,-1,-1) dist 2, others dist 3.

So one in ring 2, three in ring 3.

But should be edge cell with 2 in each.

Not matching.

Perhaps for the cell at 2026, since it's large, and in ring 26, and if it's not on a corner, it might have the full 2-2-2, and the sum of neighbors might be computable.

But for the sum, I need the actual numbers, not just the ring.

Perhaps the neighbors are at n±d for some d, but in spiral, not linear.

Another idea: in such spirals, the neighbors can be found by the relative position.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors is approximately 6 times the number, but with boundary effects, but for large n, but 2026 is not that large, and in ring 26, it may be on the edge.

Perhaps I can find the coordinates for n=2026.

For n in ring k, with k=26, as above.

 f = 3*26*25 +2 = 3*650 +2 = 1950+2 = 1952

So first number of ring 26 is 1952.

Number of cells in ring 26 is 6*26 = 156.

So n=2026, so i = 2026 - 1952 = 74

Then s = floor(i / k) = floor(74 / 26) = 2, since 26*2=52, 74-52=22, so s=2, p=22

k=26, so s = floor(74 / 26) = 2, since 26*2=52 ≤ 74 < 78=26*3, so s=2, p=74-52=22

s=2 corresponds to northeast side, according to our earlier assumption for ring 2, s=2 is northeast.

p=22, so position 22 on the side of 26 cells, so not a corner, since p=0 would be corner, p=25 would be the end, but for k=26, p from 0 to 25, so p=22 is near the end, but not corner.

For an edge cell, it should have 2 neighbors in ring k-1=25, 2 in ring k=26, 2 in ring k+1=27.

The numbers in those rings can be found.

The sum would be the sum of those six numbers.

Since the rings are consecutive, and the cell is not on corner, perhaps the neighbors are at specific offsets.

For example, in ring k, for a cell on the northeast side, at position p, the neighbors might be at fixed relative indices.

But it might be complicated.

Perhaps the number at the cell and its neighbors can be related by the geometry.

Another thought: in many spirals, the sum of neighbors for a cell in the interior is 6n or something, but here it may not be.

For example, take cell 1: neighbors 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

Cell 1 is 1, 6*1=6, not 27.

Cell 2: neighbors: in cube, (1,-1,0), neighbors include cell 1 (0,0,0), cell 3 (1,0,-1), cell 7 (0,-1,1), and cells in ring 2: say (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,-2,1) which are 10,11,8 or something.

From earlier diagram, for cell 2, neighbors are cell 1, cell 3, cell 7, and in ring 2: cell 8,9,10 or something.

In the grid, cell 2 at (1,-1,0), neighbors: (2,-1,-1), (2,-2,0), (1,0,-1) cell 3, (0,-1,0) not cell, (0,0,-1) not, (1,-2,1) cell 8? etc.

From the diagram, for cell 2, in middle row, left is cell 1, right is cell 9, above-right is cell 3, below-right is cell 8 or something.

In the diagram:
Upper row: 14,4,3,10
Middle: 15,5,1,2,9
Lower: 16,6,7,8

So for cell 2: adjacent to:
- left: cell 1
- right: cell 9
- upper-left: cell 5? But cell 5 is left of 1, not directly above-left.
- upper-right: cell 3
- lower-left: cell 7? Cell 7 is in lower row, below cell 1 or cell 2?
- lower-right: cell 8? Cell 8 is below cell 7 or cell 2?

From positions, likely cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1 (left), cell 3 (upper-right), cell 9 (right), cell 8 (lower-right), cell 7 (lower), cell 5 (upper-left) or something.

Cell 5 is at left of cell 1, so probably not adjacent to cell 2.

Cell 6 is in lower row, cell 7, etc.

Assume that cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 7, cell 8, cell 9, and perhaps cell 10 or cell 1 only.

From the spiral path, cell 2 is between 1 and 3, so adjacent to 1 and 3.

Also, later cell 9 is adjacent to 8 and 10, and to 2? In the diagram, in the same row, so probably adjacent to cell 2.

Similarly, cell 8 is in lower row, below cell 2 or cell 1.

In hex grid, cell 2 may be adjacent to cell 7 and cell 8.

For example, in cube, if cell 2 at (1,-1,0), cell 7 at (0,-1,1), distance |1-0| + |-1+1| + |0-1| =1+0+1=2, not adjacent.

Cell 8 at (1,-2,1), distance |1-1| + |-1+2| + |0-1| =0+1+1=2, not.

Cell 9 at (2,-2,0), distance |1-2| + |-1+2| + |0-0| =1+1+0=2, not.

So not adjacent.

Perhaps the grid is flat top.

Assume flat top hex grid.

Set cell 1 at (0,0)

Then neighbors:
- above: cell 4
- below: cell 7
- above-left: cell 3
- above-right: cell 2
- below-left: cell 6
- below-right: cell 5 or something.

From the sequence, after 1, it goes to 2, so cell 2 is a neighbor.

Then to 3, so cell 3 adjacent to 2.

Then to 4, adjacent to 3.

Then to 5, adjacent to 4.

Then to 6, adjacent to 5.
Then to 7, adjacent to 6.
Then to 8, adjacent to 7.

In flat top, the cells are in rows.

Assume row y=0: cells at x=0: cell 1
But then neighbors at (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (-1,1) or something.

Standard for flat top: for a cell at (x,y), with y even, x even, then neighbors (x±2,y), (x±1,y±1)

For example, cell 1: (0,0)

Then neighbors: (2,0), (-2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)

Then cell 2 at say (2,0), cell 3 at (1,1), cell 4 at (0,2), cell 5 at (-1,1), cell 6 at (-2,0), cell 7 at (-1,-1) or something.

Then from cell 7, to cell 8, adjacent, say at (0,-2) or (1,-1) etc.

If cell 7 at (-1,-1), then neighbors include (1,-1), ( -3,-1), (0,0) occupied, (0,-2), (-2,0), (-2,-2), etc.

Say cell 8 at (1,-1) or (0,-2) or (-2,0) etc.

In diagram, in lower row with 6 and 7, cell 6 at say (-2,0), cell 7 at (-1,-1), cell 8 at (0,-2) or (1,-1)

Then cell 9 at (2,0) but occupied by cell 2, or (3,0) or (1,0) etc.

This is similar.

Perhaps for this specific grid, from the given numbers, I can see the pattern for the neighbors.

For example, for cell 1: neighbors 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 27.

For cell 2: from the diagram, in middle row, between cell 1 and cell 9, and above cell 8, below cell 3, etc.

From the arrangement, likely cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, cell 8, and cell 7, and cell 5 or something.

Suppose that cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1 (left), cell 3 (upper-right), cell 9 (right), cell 8 (lower-right), cell 7 (lower), and cell 5 (upper-left) but cell 5 is not close.

Perhaps only five neighbors, but should have six.

In the diagram, for cell 2, it might be adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, and then below to cell 7 and cell 8, but cell 7 and 8 are not both adjacent.

Perhaps cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, cell 8, and cell 7, and cell 6 or something.

Assume that in the grid, cell 2 is at a position where it has cell 1 west, cell 3 northeast, cell 9 east, cell 8 southeast, cell 7 south, cell 6 southwest, but cell 6 is at left, not below.

Perhaps from the numbers.

For cell 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

For cell 2, likely neighbors include 1,3,8,9, and perhaps 7, and another.

In the spiral, cell 2 is between 1 and 3, so adjacent to 1 and 3.

Cell 8 is adjacent to 7 and 9, and to 2? In the diagram, cell 8 is below cell 2 or not.

In the lower row, cell 8 is at the end, cell 2 in middle, so probably not directly below.

Perhaps cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, cell 10, cell 8, cell 7, but too many.

Let's list for cell 2 from the diagram and spiral.

From the spiral path: cell 2 is between 1 and 3, so adjacent to 1 and 3.

Cell 9 is after 8, and before 10, and in the same row as 2, so likely adjacent to 2 and 8 and 10.

Cell 8 is after 7, before 9, in lower row, so adjacent to 7 and 9.

Cell 7 is after 6, before 8, adjacent to 6 and 8.

Cell 6 adjacent to 5 and 7.

 etc.

For cell 2, it is not directly adjacent to 7 or 8, only to 1,3,9, and perhaps to cell 10 or cell 1 only.

In the grid, cell 2 may have cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, and then cell 4, cell 5, cell 10, but not.

Perhaps cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1, cell 3, cell 9, cell 10, cell 8, and cell 7, but that's six, but may not be.

Assume that cell 2 is adjacent to cell 1 (west), cell 3 (northeast), cell 9 (east), cell 8 (southeast), cell 7 (south), and cell 6 (southwest), but cell 6 is not south of cell 2.

Perhaps in the coordinate, cell 2 at (0,0) for a different system.

I think I need to look for a different strategy.

Perhaps the sum of the six neighbors can be found by noting that for a number n, the neighbors are at n±a, n±b, n±c for some a,b,c depending on the ring.

Or perhaps the differences are constant for each ring.

For example, in ring k, for a cell at index i, the neighbors have indices i±d in the ring or in the total.

But it's complicated.

Perhaps for large n, the sum is approximately 6n, and for n=2026, in ring 26, not on corner, so sum close to 6*2026=12156, and since it's not on corner, the error is small, but I need exact value.

Or perhaps calculate for a small cell not on corner.

For example, in ring 2, cell 9: if s=0, p=1, edge cell.

In our earlier axial coordinate assumption, for s=0, p=1: (1,-2)

Then neighbors: in axial, for (1,-2), neighbors are (2,-2), (0,-2), (1,-1), (1,-3), (2,-3), (0,-1)

Some may not be occupied yet.

Cell at (2,-2) might be cell 10, (0,-2) cell 8, (1,-1) may be cell 2 or new, (1,-3) new, etc.

If we assume the cells are placed, cell 8 at (0,-2), cell 9 at (1,-2), cell 10 at (2,-2), cell 11 at (2,-1), etc.

So for cell 9 (1,-2), neighbors:
 (2,-2) = cell 10
 (0,-2) = cell 8
 (1,-1) may be cell 2 or cell 11, but cell 2 at (1,0), not (1,-1)
 (1,-3) new
 (2,-3) new
 (0,-1) may be cell 7 or new.

Cell 7 at (0,1), not (0,-1)

So (1,-1) is free, etc.

So neighbors are cell 8 (0,-2), cell 10 (2,-2), and (1,-1), (1,-3), (2,-3), (0,-1)

All at distance 2 or 3.

The numbers: cell 8=8, cell 10=10, and the others are in ring 3 or later, so numbers like 20 or something, not in ring 1 or 2.

But cell 2 is at (1,0), not adjacent.

So not good.

Perhaps in this grid, the cell at (1,-2) is cell 9, and its neighbor cell 2 is not adjacent, so the neighbors are only within the ring or something, but that can't be.

I think I have to assume the cube coordinates and accept that for cell 2, neighbors include cell 1, cell 3, cell 7, and three others.

For cell 2 in ring 1, neighbors include cell 1 (ring 0), cell 3 (ring 1), cell 7 (ring 1), and three in ring 2: say cell 8,9,10.

In the diagram, cell 8,9,10 are in ring 2, and if cell 2 is adjacent to them, then for n=2, neighbors are 1,3,7,8,9,10.

Sum 1+3+7+8+9+10=38

Similarly for cell 3: neighbors might be 1,2,4,10,11,12 or something.

Cell 3 at (1,0,-1), neighbors include cell 1 (0,0,0), cell 2 (1,-1,0), cell 4 (0,1,-1), and (2,0,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,1,-2), etc.

In diagram, cell 10 is near, so perhaps cell 10,11,12.

Sum for cell 3: 1,2,4,10,11,12 = 1+2+4+10+11+12=40

For cell 1: 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

Now for cell 2026, in ring 26, s=2 (northeast side), p=22.

As an edge cell, it should have 2 neighbors in ring 25, 2 in ring 26, 2 in ring 27.

The numbers in those rings can be calculated.

First, ring 25: T(24) = 3*24*25 +1 = 3*600+1=1801, so ring 25 starts at 1802, has 6*25=150 cells, from 1802 to 1801+150=1951.

T(24) = cells up to ring 24 = 3*24*25 +1 = 1800+1=1801, so ring 25: 1802 to 1801+150=1951.

Ring 26: 1952 to 1951+156=2107, as before.

Ring 27: starts at T(26)+1 = 2107+1=2108, has 6*27=162 cells, from 2108 to 2107+162=2269.

Now for a cell in ring 26, with s=2, p=22, on the northeast side, not corner (since p=22>0 and p<25).

The two neighbors in ring 25: likely the cells that are " inward" from it.

Similarly for ring 27, outward.

The indices might be proportional.

For example, in ring k, for a cell at position i in the ring, the neighbors in ring k-1 might be at i - c, i - d for some c,d.

But it may depend on the side.

Perhaps for the same side, the neighbor in ring k-1 at the same p or p-1.

For example, for cell 9 in ring 2, s=0, p=1, if it is edge, neighbors in ring 1: cell 7 at southeast, which is s=5 for ring 1, p=0 or 1.

Cell 7 is at s=5, p=0 for ring 1.

Cell 9 is at s=0, p=1 for ring 2.

So not the same s.

Perhaps the relative position.

In general, for a cell at (x,y,z) in cube coordinates, the neighbors are at (x±1,y,z∓1), etc, but with sum 0.

Then the number at each position can be found from the ring and the sector.

For a cell in ring k, on the northeast side, which is the direction (1,0,-1), so cells with y=0, x>0, z<0, and x= k, z= -k, for the corner, but for general, for s=2, northeast, the cells have y=0, x>0, z= -x, but sum x+y+z=x+0- x=0, good, and |x|+|y|+|z|=|x|+0+|-x|=2|x|, so for distance k, |x| = k/2, not integer unless k even.

For example, ring 1: |x|=0.5, not integer, but we have cell 3 at (1,0,-1), |x|=1, not 0.5.

So not.

For northeast side, cells with x > 0, z < 0, and y=0, but then |x| + |z| = |x| + | -x| =2|x| for distance, so |x| = k/2, so only when k even.

But for k=1, cell 3 at (1,0,-1), |x|=1, k=1, 1 = k, not k/2.

So not.

Perhaps y is not 0.

In general, for the northeast side, cells have x = k, y = -p, z = -k + p or something.

For example, for ring 1, s=2, p=0: cell 3 at (1,0,-1), so x=1, y=0, z= -1.

For ring 2, s=2, p=0: cell 12 at say (2,0,-2), p=1: cell 13 at (2,1,-3) or (2,-1,-1) etc.

If (2,0,-2) for p=0, (2,1,-3) for p=1, but sum for (2,1,-3):2+1-3=0, good, distance |2|+|1|+|-3|=6, distance 3, not 2.

So not.

 (2,0,-2) for p=0, (2,1,-3) not distance 2.

 (2,0,-2) and (2,1,-3) not adjacent.

Perhaps (2,0,-2) and (2,1,-3) but not adjacent and not same distance.

For distance 2, cells like (2,0,-2), (2,-1,-1), (1,1,-2), etc.

For s=2, p=0: (2,0,-2), p=1: (2,-1,-1) or (1,1,-2)

Then if (2,0,-2) and (2,-1,-1), distance |2-2| + |0+1| + |-2+1| =0+1+1=2, not adjacent.

 (2,0,-2) and (1,1,-2), distance |2-1| + |0-1| + |-2+2| =1+1+0=2, not.

So same problem.

I think for the sake of time, I'll assume that for a cell not on corner, the six neighbors are at n - a, n - b, n - c, n + d, n + e, n + f for some offsets, but it's hard.

Perhaps the sum can be calculated by noting that the neighbors are at fixed relative positions in the spiral order.

For example, for a cell at n, the neighbors are at n±1, n±k, n±m for some k,m depending on n.

But from the path, it's not regular.

Another idea: in many spirals, the sum of neighbors for a cell in the interior is 6n, but here for cell 1, it's 27, not 6, so not.

For cell in ring k, the sum might be 6n + c_k, but c_k may depend on k.

Perhaps for large k, it's approximately 6n.

For n=2026, sum approximately 12156.

But let's calculate for a cell in ring 2.

Take cell 10: in ring 2, s=1, p=0, corner cell.

In our earlier axial or cube, but assume in the diagram, cell 10 is in upper row, to the right of 3, so likely adjacent to cell 3.

Cell 3 is 3, cell 10 is 10.

If cell 10 is corner, neighbors might include cell 3 in ring 1, cell 9 in ring 2, cell 11 in ring 2, and cells in ring 3.

Suppose neighbors are cell 3, cell 9, cell
