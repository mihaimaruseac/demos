The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of all six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on this hexagonal grid.

From the snippet given:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7, but it's not symmetric. Let me sketch this out.

Assuming a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. The center is 1. Around it, we have numbers 2 through 7. But in the text, it shows:

After 1, it goes to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc. But in the diagram, it's a bit messy. Let me interpret the diagram.

The second line is: ".. 15 5 1 2 9 ..." so from left to right: 15,5,1,2,9

Above it: "... 14 4 3 10 ..." so 14,4,3,10

Below: "... 16 6 7 8 ..." so 16,6,7,8

So, relative to 1, we have:

- Above-left: 14? That seems far. Probably not adjacent.

I need to understand the adjacency. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. For cell 1, its neighbors should be the cells adjacent to it.

Looking at the diagram, directly to the right of 1 is 2. Below-right is 7? In the bottom line, after 1 is 2, and below is 6,7,8. But 6 is below-left or something.

Perhaps I should assign coordinates to the hexagons.

I recall that in hexagonal grids, we often use axial coordinates or offset coordinates.

But maybe for this spiral, there's a standard way.

I remember that hexagonal spirals are sometimes used in problems like this.

Perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for the spiral.

Let me list the numbers in order and see their positions.

Start at 1.

Then, moving to adjacent cells. From 1, it probably goes to 2, then to 3, etc.

In the diagram, after 1 is 2, then above 2 is 3? In the top line, it's 14,4,3,10. 3 is next to 4 and 10? This is confusing.

Look at the sequence: from the diagram, reading row by row might not work because it's staggered.

Notice that 1 is surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7? But 8 is also close.

List the neighbors of 1.

From the diagram: directly right is 2. Then above-right is 3? But in the top line, 3 is shown, and left of 3 is 4, but 4 is above 1? The line above has 14,4,3,10. So 4 is above 1? Since below 1 is 6,7,8.

Assume that the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops? In the diagram, it seems like flat tops because the rows are horizontal.

In flat-top hexagonal grid, each row is horizontal, and adjacent rows are offset.

In this case, row above: 14,4,3,10 — but 14 and 4 are above what? Probably above 15 and 5 or something.

The second row is 15,5,1,2,9. So let's say this is row y=0 or something.

Set coordinates.

Assume that the center 1 is at (0,0).

In hexagonal grid with flat tops, we can use cube coordinates or axial.

To simplify, let's use a system where each cell has coordinates (x,y), and neighbors are at (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y∓1) or something, but need to be careful.

Standard axial coordinates for hex grids: let's say q and r, with s = -q-r, but that might be complicated.

For this problem, since it's a spiral, I can find the ring number for each number.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal rings.

The first ring (center) is just 1.

The second ring has numbers 2 through 7, 6 cells since each ring has 6 times the ring number cells? Let's see.

Ring 0: 1 cell, number 1.

Ring 1: 6 cells, numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Ring 2: 12 cells? Numbers 8 to 19? From the diagram, after 7 is 8, then 9,10, etc.

In the bottom line: 16,6,7,8 — so after 7 is 8.

Then above, 3,10 — 10 is after 9? The second row has 2,9, so after 2 is 9? That doesn't make sense.

The sequence should be sequential: 1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7, then 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc. for ring 2.

Ring 1: 2 to 7, that's 6 numbers.

Ring 2: should be 8 to 19? 12 numbers, since each ring has 6*k cells for ring k.

Ring 0: k=0, 1 cell.

Ring 1: k=1, 6 cells.

Ring 2: k=2, 12 cells.

Ring 3: k=3, 18 cells, and so on.

So total cells up to ring n is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+n) = 1 + 6*n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 3n(n+1)

The largest number in ring n is the cumulative sum.

The first number of ring n is after the sum of previous rings.

Sum of cells up to ring m is S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

For m=0, S(0)=1

m=1, S(1)=1+3*1*2=7, which is correct, numbers 1 to 7.

m=2, S(2)=1+3*2*3=1+18=19, so numbers 1 to 19 for up to ring 2.

But in the diagram, we see 14,15,16, which are in ring 2, and 10,9,8, etc.

Now, what are the neighbors? But for number 2026, I need to find its position.

First, find which ring it is in.

So, find the smallest n such that S(n) >= 2026.

S(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

Set 1 + 3n(n+1) >= 2026

3n(n+1) >= 2025

n(n+1) >= 675

n^2 + n - 675 >= 0

Solve quadratic: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let's see, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 2704 - 2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97, so n >= ( -1 + 51.97)/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.485

So n >= 26? Let me compute exactly.

n(n+1) >= 675

n=25, 25*26=650 < 675

n=26, 26*27=702 >= 675

So S(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951

S(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107

S(n) is the last number in ring n.

Ring n contains numbers from S(n-1) + 1 to S(n)

Ring 0: 1

Ring 1: 2 to 7

Ring 2: 8 to 19

Ring 3: 20 to 37? S(2)=19, S(3)=1+3*3*4=1+36=37, yes.

So ring n: starts at S(n-1) + 1, ends at S(n)

With S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

S(n-1) = 1 + 3(n-1)n

So first number of ring n: S(n-1) + 1 = 1 + 3n(n-1) + 1 = 2 + 3n(n-1)

Last number: S(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1)

For n=26, S(25)=1+3*25*26=1+1950=1951

So ring 26 starts at 1952, ends at S(26)=1+3*26*27=1+3*702=1+2106=2107

2026 is between 1952 and 2107, so it's in ring 26.

Now, each ring has 6n cells, for ring n.

Ring n has 6n cells.

Here n=26, so 156 cells.

The numbers go from 1952 to 2107 inclusive, which is 2107-1952+1=156, yes.

In a hexagonal spiral, the ring is divided into 6 sides, each with n cells.

For example, ring 1 (n=1) has 6 cells, but since it's the first ring, each "side" has one cell, but typically, for ring n, each side has n cells.

Ring 1: 6 cells, each side has 1 cell? But in a hexagon, each side has length, but for cells, ring n has 6n cells, so each side has n cells.

For example, ring 2: 12 cells, so each side has 2 cells.

In the diagram, for ring 2: numbers 8 to 19.

How are they arranged? From the snippet:

Top row: 14,4,3,10 — but 4 and 3 are in ring 1, I think.

Perhaps I need to see the positions.

Typically, in such spirals, starting from center, after ring k, we move to ring k+1 by adding a cell in one direction.

But to find neighbors, I need the exact position of 2026 in its ring.

So, within ring n, the numbers are assigned in order along the perimeter.

The first cell of ring n is adjacent to the last cell of ring n-1.

For ring n, it starts at the "top-right" or something, depending on orientation.

From the diagram: center 1.

Then, probably, it moves right to 2.

Then, since it's a spiral, it might go clockwise or counterclockwise.

In the diagram, after 1 is 2 (right), then above 2 is 3? But in top row, 3 is left of 10? Confusing.

Look at the sequence: 1, then 2, then probably 3 is above or something.

From the neighbors: for 1, neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the diagram: right:2, then above-right:3? Top row has 3 and 4, but 4 is left of 3? The top row is 14,4,3,10, so 4 then 3? That would be decreasing, but numbers increase.

Perhaps the spiral is clockwise or counterclockwise.

Assume that from 1, it goes to 2 (east), then to 3 (northeast), but in flat-top hex grid, northeast might not be direct.

List the cells around 1.

Suppose we have cell 1 at (0,0).

Adjacent cells: let's say direction: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast.

In standard hex grid flat-top, the neighbors are: (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) or something. Need to define.

Set coordinates.

Let me define axial coordinates q and r.

Set center at (0,0).

Neighbors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) — but (1,0) and (1,-1) are adjacent? Distance should be 1.

In axial coordinates, distance |dq| + |dr| + |ds| = 0, but s= -q-r, so for two cells, |dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr| should be 2? Standard is sum of absolute differences in q and r, but since s= -q-r, the distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|), but for axial, it's |q1-q2| + |r1-r2| + |s1-s2| all divided by 2 or something. I'm confusing myself.

For simplicity, in a hexagonal grid, the Manhattan distance in cube coordinates.

Set cube coordinates: each cell has coordinates (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0.

Then neighbors are (x±1,y,z∓1), etc., but specifically: (x+1,y-1,z), (x+1,y,z-1), (x,y+1,z-1), (x-1,y+1,z), (x-1,y,z+1), (x,y-1,z+1) — but since x+y+z=0, we can use two coordinates.

Usually, we use (q,r) with s= -q-r, but for distance, |dq| + |dr| + |ds| = 2 |dq| + 2|dr| if ds= -dq-dr, but it's messy.

For this problem, I can find the position by the ring and the side.

So, for ring n, there are 6n cells.

The first cell of ring n is at position (n,0) or something, but in which direction.

Typically, in many spirals, it starts at the "east" or "northeast" direction.

From the diagram, for ring 1: cells 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the second row: 15,5,1,2,9 — so 2 is east of 1.

Then below: 16,6,7,8 — so south of 1 is 6? Or southeast.

Assume that from 1, moving east to 2, then northeast to 3, north to 4, northwest to 5, west to 6, southwest to 7.

In the diagram, below 1 is 6 and 7, so perhaps south is 6 and 7.

In bottom row: 16,6,7,8 — so 6 and 7 are below, with 6 left of 7? But 6 is southwest, 7 is southeast? But 1 is at center, so below might be south.

In flat-top hex grid, the cell directly below is south.

But here, there are two cells below: in the bottom row, it's 6 and 7, but 6 is left, 7 is right, so perhaps 6 is southwest, 7 is southeast.

Then above, top row has 4 and 3, with 4 left, 3 right, so 4 is northwest, 3 is northeast.

Then left, in the second row, left of 1 is 5, and then 15, so 5 is west.

Right of 1 is 2, then 9.

So neighbors of 1: east:2, northeast:3, northwest:4, west:5, southwest:6, southeast:7.

In the diagram: east:2, then northeast should be 3, but in the top row, it's 4,3,10 — 4 is northwest, 3 is northeast? But 3 is to the right of 4, so if we go from left to right, 4 then 3, so if q increases to the right, then 4 has smaller q than 3? This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the grid is oriented with pointy tops.

In pointy-top hex grid, the rows are staggered, and each column is vertical.

In the diagram, the rows are horizontal, so probably flat-top.

To avoid confusion, let's list the sequence from the spiral.

Start at 1.

Move east to 2.

Then, from 2, move northeast to 3? But in the diagram, above 2 is 3? In the top row, 3 is above 2? But in the second row is 15,5,1,2,9, so 2 is at the end, and above it is 3? The top row has 14,4,3,10, and 3 is above 2? Let's see the positions.

Assume that the cells are arranged in rows.

Row 0: cells with r=0: say cell at (0,0) is 1.

Then row -1 (above): cells at q= -1,0,1 or something.

From the diagram, row above has 14,4,3,10 — but that's four cells, while row 0 has five cells: 15,5,1,2,9, so it's offset.

In flat-top hex grid, each row has a fixed y, and x varies, and adjacent rows have x offset by half, but since it's discrete, we can use integer coordinates with a shift.

For example, let y be the row number, and for each y, x ranges over integers.

For even y, x even or something, but it's messy.

Notice that for cell 1 at (0,0), its neighbors are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) in axial coordinates, but let's define.

Set (q,r) with q + r + s = 0, but s is redundant.

Define the six directions as vectors.

Let the six neighbors be at:

East: (1,0)

Northeast: (0,1)

Northwest: (-1,1)

West: (-1,0)

Southwest: (0,-1)

Southeast: (1,-1)

Then for a cell at (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)

And the sum q+r+s=0 with s= -q-r, but for distance, the ring number is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) or something.

In this coordinate system, the distance from origin is max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|)? Let's calculate for a cell.

For example, cell (1,0): |q|=1, |r|=0, |s|=| -1-0|=1, so max is 1, and it's in ring 1.

Cell (0,1): max| q|,|r|,|s| = max(0,1,1)=1

Cell (1,-1): q=1,r=-1,s= -1-(-1)=0? s= -q-r = -1 - (-1) = 0, so max| q|,|r|,|s| = max(1,1,0)=1

Cell (2,0): q=2,r=0,s=-2, max=2, ring 2.

Cell (1,1): q=1,r=1,s=-2, max=2, ring 2.

Cell (0,2): max(0,2,2)=2, ring 2.

Cell (-1,1): q=-1,r=1,s=0, max(1,1,0)=1, ring 1.

Now, the spiral path: start at (0,0) =1.

Then move to east: (1,0)=2.

Then to northeast: (1,1)? But (1,1) is at distance 2, not adjacent to (1,0)? Adjacent cells are only those differing by one in the vectors.

From (1,0), neighbors are (2,0), (1,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (2,-1)? Let's list:

From (q,r) = (1,0)

Neighbors:

(q+1,r)=(2,0)

(q,r+1)=(1,1)

(q-1,r+1)=(0,1)

(q-1,r)=(0,0) — this is 1, already visited

(q,r-1)=(1,-1)

(q+1,r-1)=(2,-1)

So new cells are (2,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,-1), (2,-1)

But in the spiral, it should go to the next one. From 2, it probably goes to 3 at (1,1) or (2,0), etc.

In the diagram, after 2 is 3, and 3 is northeast, so likely (1,1).

Then from 3=(1,1), neighbors are (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0)

(1,0) is 2, visited, so new: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (0,2), (2,0)

But in the spiral, it might go to (0,1) or (2,1).

In the diagram, above 3 is 4? Top row has 4 and 3, with 4 left of 3, so if q increases to the right, 4 has smaller q, so perhaps (0,1) is 4.

Assume that from (1,1) it goes northwest to (0,1)=4.

Then from 4=(0,1), neighbors: (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1), (0,0), (1,0)

All except (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1) are visited or center.

Visited: (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, so new: (0,2), (-1,2), (-1,1)

Probably it goes west to (-1,1)=5.

In the diagram, left of 1 is 5, and 5 is at (-1,1)? Let's see.

If (0,0)=1, (-1,1)=5, then west is (-1,0), but (-1,0) is not yet assigned.

From 4=(0,1), it went to 5=(-1,1).

Then from 5=(-1,1), neighbors: (0,1), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-1,0), (0,0)

Visited: (0,0), (0,1), so new: (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-1,0)

Probably goes southwest to (-1,0)=6.

In the diagram, below-left is 6.

Then from 6=(-1,0), neighbors: (0,0), (-1,1), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1)

Visited: (0,0), (-1,1), so new: (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1)

Goes to (0,-1)=7? Southeast or south.

In diagram, below is 6 and 7, with 7 to the right, so (0,-1)=7.

Then from 7=(0,-1), neighbors: (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

Visited: (0,0), (-1,0), so new: (1,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

Now, it should go to the next ring. The next number is 8, which in diagram is after 7, and bottom row has 7,8, so probably (1,-1)=8.

Then continue.

So far: 1:(0,0), 2:(1,0), 3:(1,1), 4:(0,1), 5:(-1,1), 6:(-1,0), 7:(0,-1), 8:(1,-1)

Now ring 2 should have 12 cells: 8 to 19.

From 8=(1,-1), neighbors: (2,-1), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)? Let's list:

q=1,r=-1

Neighbors:

(q+1,r)=(2,-1)

(q,r+1)=(1,0) — visited (2)

(q-1,r+1)=(0,0) — visited (1)

(q-1,r)=(0,-1) — visited (7)

(q,r-1)=(1,-2)

(q+1,r-1)=(2,-2)

So new cells: (2,-1), (1,-2), (2,-2)

Probably it goes east to (2,-1)=9? In diagram, after 8 is 9? Second row has 2,9, so yes, east of 8 is 9.

In the bottom row: 16,6,7,8 — 8 is at end, and next is 9, which is in the same row? But row below might be different.

In our coordinates, (1,-1) is 8, east is (2,-1)=9.

Then from 9=(2,-1), neighbors: (3,-1), (2,0), (1,-1), (1,-2), (2,-2), (3,-2)

Visited: (1,-1)=8, so new: (3,-1), (2,0), (1,-2), (2,-2), (3,-2)

Now, (2,0) is adjacent, but not visited yet. Ring 1 has (1,0)=2, but (2,0) is new.

Probably it goes northeast to (2,0)=10? But in diagram, top row has 10 after 3? 3 is (1,1), 10 is at (2,0)? Distance: from (1,1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=-1, ds=0? s= -q-r, s1=-1-1=-2, s2=-2-0=-2, ds=0, dq=1, dr=-1, so max|dq|,|dr|,|ds|=max(1,1,0)=1, so adjacent? Yes, since |dq| + |dr| + |ds| =1+1+0=2, and in hex grid, adjacent if Manhattan distance 2 in cube coords.

Cube coordinates: for (q,r,s) with s=-q-r, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2, and adjacent if distance 1, so |dq|+|dr|+|ds|=2.

From (1,1) to (2,0): dq=1, dr=-1, ds= - (2+0) - (-1-1) wait no: s1 = -q1-r1 = -1-1=-2, s2=-2-0=-2, ds=0, dq=1, dr=-1, sum |dq|+|dr|+|ds|=1+1+0=2, yes adjacent.

In diagram, is 10 adjacent to 3? Top row has 14,4,3,10, so yes, 3 and 10 are adjacent.

And 10 is to the right of 3, so if q increases right, then (2,0) has q=2, (1,1) has q=1, so yes, (2,0) is east of (1,1)? From (1,1) to (2,0): q increases by 1, r decreases by 1, which is southeast direction? In our earlier definition, southeast is (q+1,r-1), yes, exactly southeast.

But in the spiral, from 9=(2,-1), it might go to (2,0) or elsewhere.

In diagram, after 9? Second row has 2,9, and then probably next is 10, which is above.

From 9=(2,-1), it goes northeast to (2,0)=10.

Then from 10=(2,0), neighbors: (3,0), (2,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (2,-1), (3,-1)

Visited: (1,0)=2, (1,-1)=8? (2,-1)=9, so new: (3,0), (2,1), (3,-1)

Probably goes north to (2,1)=11? Northeast direction.

Then continue.

But for the spiral path, it continues around the ring.

Now back to ring 26.

We have number 2026 in ring n=26.

First number of ring n is S(n-1) + 1 = 1952 for n=26.

Last is 2107.

The ring has 6n = 156 cells.

The numbers are assigned sequentially along the perimeter.

The perimeter is traversed in a certain direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.

From our earlier path, for ring 1: started at (1,0)=2, then (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (0,-1)=7.

So from east, then northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast? Directions: from (1,0) to (1,1): northeast, then to (0,1): northwest? From (1,1) to (0,1): decrease q, same r? In axial, decreasing q with r constant is west-northwest? But in standard, it's northwest direction? Earlier we have northwest as (-1,1), which is decrease q, increase r? From (1,1) to (0,1): dq=-1, dr=0, ds=1? s=-q-r, s1=-1-1=-2, s2=0-1=-1? ds=1, dq=-1, dr=0, sum |dq|+|dr|+|ds|=1+0+1=2, direction is west? Since q decreases, r same.

In our direction vectors: west is (-1,0), but here it's (-1,0) in q,r? From (1,1) to (0,1): dq=-1, dr=0, which is west direction? But west is defined as (-1,0), which is same as decreasing q by 1, r unchanged.

But in the sequence, from 3 to 4: (1,1) to (0,1), which is west? But earlier I thought northwest, but northwest is (-1,1), which is decrease q, increase r.

Here dr=0, so it's pure west.

But in the hex grid, moving west from (1,1) to (0,1) is adjacent.

Then from (0,1) to (-1,1): again west? dq=-1, dr=0.

Then to (-1,0): from (-1,1) to (-1,0): dq=0, dr=-1, which is south? Since r decreases.

Southwest or south? In our vectors, southwest is (0,-1)? Earlier I defined southwest as (0,-1), which is dq=0, dr=-1.

But from (-1,1) to (-1,0): dq=0, dr=-1, so southwest? But southwest is typically down-left, here q same, r decreases, so if r is vertical, it's down.

In flat-top, r might be the row, but in axial, it's not necessarily.

Anyway, direction is consistent.

So for ring 1, the path is: start at east (1,0), then move to northeast? No, from (1,0) to (1,1): dq=0, dr=1? From (1,0) to (1,1): dq=0, dr=1, which is north? Since r increases.

In vectors, northeast was defined as (0,1), dq=0, dr=1.

But earlier I said northeast is (0,1), yes.

From (1,0) to (1,1): dq=0, dr=1, so northeast? But (1,1) is northeast of (1,0)? In terms of direction, yes.

Then from (1,1) to (0,1): dq=-1, dr=0, west.

Then to (-1,1): west again.

Then to (-1,0): dq=0, dr=-1, southwest.

Then to (0,-1): dq=1, dr=-1, southeast? From (-1,0) to (0,-1): dq=1, dr=-1, which is southeast, since (1,-1).

But earlier I went to (0,-1), which is south? From (-1,0) to (0,-1): dq=1, dr=-1.

In vectors, southeast is (1,-1), yes.

But in the sequence, it was to (0,-1), which is correct.

Now for ring 2, started at (1,-1)=8? Earlier we had 8 at (1,-1).

From 7=(0,-1), to 8=(1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Then to 9=(2,-1): east again? dq=1, dr=0.

Then to 10=(2,0): dq=0, dr=1, northeast.

Then probably to (2,1): dq=0, dr=1, northeast again? But ring 2 has 12 cells, so each side has 2 cells.

So likely, it moves in straight lines along each direction for n steps.

For ring n, each "side" has n cells, traversed in a specific direction.

The directions are cyclic: east, northeast, northwest, west, southwest, southeast, or something.

From ring 1: directions: from start: to northeast? But ring 1 started at east, then went northeast (to (1,1)), but only one cell per direction.

For ring n, it starts at the "southeast" or something.

Standard way: in many hexagonal spirals, the ring n starts at the cell just east of the start of ring n-1 or something.

From our earlier:

Ring 0: (0,0)

Ring 1: starts at (1,0) - east

Then moves northeast to (1,1)

Then northwest? But it moved west to (0,1), but that's not northwest.

The path for ring 1: (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,0) -> (0,-1)

Directions: from (1,0) to (1,1): dr=1, dq=0, north? Or northeast.

In terms of direction changes: it moved north, then west, west, south, southeast? Not consistent.

Notice that after moving to a direction, it continues in that direction until it hits a corner, then turns.

For ring n, it starts by moving east for n steps? But for n=1, only one step.

General pattern: for ring n, it starts at (n,0) or something.

For ring 1: cells at (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)

The min and max q,r: q from -1 to 1, r from -1 to 1, but not all.

The "corner" cells: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)

Now for ring 2: we have (1,-1)=8, (2,-1)=9, (2,0)=10, then probably (2,1)=11, (1,2)? Or (1,1) is already taken.

From 10=(2,0), to (2,1)=11, then to (1,2)? From (2,1) to (1,2): dq=-1, dr=1, which is northwest? Since (-1,1) vector.

Then to (0,2), etc.

In diagram, after 10 is? Top row has 3,10, then probably 11,12.

Assume: 8:(1,-1), 9:(2,-1), 10:(2,0), 11:(2,1), 12:(1,2)? Then 13:(0,2), 14:(-1,2), 15:(-2,2), 16:(-2,1), 17:(-2,0), 18:(-1,-1), 19:(0,-2)? Or something.

In diagram, top row has 14,4,3,10 — 14 is probably (-1,2) or something, 4 is (0,1), 3 is (1,1), 10 is (2,0).

Then second row: 15,5,1,2,9 — 15 might be (-2,2)? 5 is (-1,1), 1:(0,0), 2:(1,0), 9:(2,-1)

Bottom: 16,6,7,8 — 16:(-2,1)? 6:(-1,0), 7:(0,-1), 8:(1,-1)

So for ring 2: 8:(1,-1),9:(2,-1),10:(2,0),11:(2,1),12:(1,2)? But 12 not shown, then 13:(0,2),14:(-1,2),15:(-2,2),16:(-2,1),17:(-2,0),18:(-1,-1),19:(0,-2)? But 19 is not shown, and we have only 12 cells.

List: from start: (1,-1)=8, (2,-1)=9, (2,0)=10, then next should be (2,1)=11, then from (2,1) to (1,2)=12? dq=-1,dr=1, northwest.

Then (1,2) to (0,2)=13? dq=-1,dr=0, west.

Then (0,2) to (-1,2)=14? west again.

Then (-1,2) to (-2,2)=15? west.

Then from (-2,2) to (-2,1)=16? dq=0,dr=-1, southwest.

Then (-2,1) to (-2,0)=17? southwest again? dr=-1,dq=0.

Then (-2,0) to (-1,-1)=18? dq=1,dr=-1, southeast.

Then (-1,-1) to (0,-2)=19? dq=1,dr=-1, southeast? But we need 12 cells, so after 18, to (0,-2)=19, but ring 2 should end at 19, but we have only 12 cells? 8 to 19 is 12 numbers: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.

In the path: 8:(1,-1),9:(2,-1),10:(2,0),11:(2,1),12:(1,2),13:(0,2),14:(-1,2),15:(-2,2),16:(-2,1),17:(-2,0),18:(-1,-1),19:(0,-2)

Yes.

Now the directions: from 8 to 9: dq=1,dr=0, east.

9 to 10: dq=0,dr=1, northeast.

10 to 11: dq=0,dr=1, northeast? But same direction? From (2,-1) to (2,0): dr=1,dq=0, northeast.

Then to (2,1): same, northeast.

But for ring n=2, each side has 2 cells, so in the northeast direction, it moves two steps: from (2,-1) to (2,0) to (2,1), so two moves in northeast direction.

Then from (2,1) to (1,2): dq=-1,dr=1, which is northwest? Vector (-1,1).

Then to (0,2): dq=-1,dr=0, west? But from (1,2) to (0,2): dq=-1,dr=0, west.

Then to (-1,2): west again.

Then to (-2,2): west? dq=-1,dr=0? From (-1,2) to (-2,2): yes.

Then to (-2,1): dq=0,dr=-1, southwest.

To (-2,0): southwest again.

Then to (-1,-1): dq=1,dr=-1, southeast.

To (0,-2): southeast again.

So the directions for each side:

- First side: east? But only one move: from (1,-1) to (2,-1), but it's two cells: cell 8 and 9 are both in the "south" direction? But the move is east.

Actually, the side is defined by the direction of movement.

For ring n, it starts at (n, -n+1) or something? For n=1: started at (1,0)

For n=2: started at (1,-1)

General pattern: the starting cell for ring n is at (n, 0) ? But for n=1: (1,0), n=2: (1,-1)? Not consistent.

Notice that for ring n, the starting cell is at (n, -n+1) ? For n=1: (1,0) = (1,-1+1)? -n+1=0, yes (1,0)

For n=2: (2,-2+1)=(2,-1), yes.

For n=3: should start at (3,-2)? Since -3+1=-2.

Then moves in which direction? For n=1: from (1,0) moved northeast to (1,1)? dq=0,dr=1.

But for n=2: from (1,-1) moved east to (2,-1)? dq=1,dr=0.

Different directions.

The direction changes with n.

From the path, for each ring, it moves in a sequence of directions: for ring n, it moves east for n steps? But for n=1, it moved northeast, not east.

In ring 1: moved northeast (1 step)

In ring 2: moved east (2 steps), then northeast (2 steps), etc.

Ring 1: only one direction: northeast? But it moved from (1,0) to (1,1), which is dr=1, dq=0, so if we consider the direction, it's increasing r, constant q, which is north.

But in ring 2, it moved east (increasing q, constant r), then northeast (increasing r, constant q? From (2,-1) to (2,0) to (2,1): dq=0, dr=1 each time, so same as ring 1's direction.

Then it moved northwest? From (2,1) to (1,2): dq=-1, dr=1, which is northwest.

Then west: dq=-1, dr=0.

Then southwest: dq=0, dr=-1.

Then southeast: dq=1, dr=-1.

So the six directions are:

1. East: dq=1, dr=0

2. Northeast: dq=0, dr=1

3. Northwest: dq=-1, dr=1

4. West: dq=-1, dr=0

5. Southwest: dq=0, dr=-1

6. Southeast: dq=1, dr=-1

And for each ring, it starts with a different direction.

For ring 1: started with northeast (direction 2)

For ring 2: started with east (direction 1)

For ring 3: should start with southeast or something.

General rule: for ring n, it starts with direction (n-1) mod 6 or something.

Ring 1 (n=1): direction 2 (northeast)

Ring 2 (n=2): direction 1 (east)

Perhaps direction n mod 6.

n=1: dir 1? But it was northeast, which is dir 2.

List the starting direction:

Ring 0: none

Ring 1: northeast (dir 2)

Ring 2: east (dir 1)

Ring 3: probably southeast (dir 6) or something.

The starting cell for ring n is at (n, -n+1) as we had.

From there, it moves in a sequence of directions.

For ring n, it moves in direction d_k for k=1 to 6, each for n steps.

But the first direction depends on n.

From ring 1: moved only in dir 2 (northeast) for 1 step: from (1,0) to (1,1)

But it was only one cell, but it moved to (1,1), which is the end of the first "side".

Actually, for each side, it moves n cells in that direction, but since it's a path, each move is to an adjacent cell, so for a side of length n (in terms of cells), there are n moves, but the number of cells per side is n, so the path has n segments per side.

In ring n, there are 6 sides, each consisting of n cells.

The path traverses each side by moving in a straight line in one direction for n steps (each step to adjacent cell).

The direction for each side is sequential.

The starting direction for ring n is given by the direction from the end of ring n-1 to the start of ring n.

For example, end of ring 0: (0,0)

Start of ring 1: (1,0), so from (0,0) to (1,0): dq=1,dr=0, east (dir 1)

But then in ring 1, it moved northeast, not east.

The first move of the ring is not necessarily in the direction from previous.

In ring 1, after arriving at (1,0), it turns and moves northeast.

Similarly, in ring 2, arrived at (1,-1) from (0,-1)? End of ring 1 is (0,-1)=7, start of ring 2 is (1,-1)=8, so from (0,-1) to (1,-1): dq=1,dr=0, east (dir 1), and then in ring 2, it moves east to (2,-1), so it continues in the same direction.

For ring 2, it moved east from (1,-1) to (2,-1), so direction dir 1.

Then after that, it turned to northeast for the next side.

So the first direction for ring n is the same as the direction it was moving when it arrived at the start cell, but for ring 1, it arrived from east, but then turned to northeast.

Perhaps the arrival direction determines the first move direction for the ring.

For ring 1: arrived at (1,0) from (0,0) via east (dir 1), but then it moved northeast (dir 2) for the first side.

For ring 2: arrived at (1,-1) from (0,-1) via east (dir 1), and then moved east (dir 1) for the first side.

Inconsistent.

Perhaps for ring n, the first direction is dir (2n) mod 6 or something.

Let's list the first direction for each ring.

Ring 1: first move: from (1,0) to (1,1): dir 2 (northeast)

Ring 2: from (1,-1) to (2,-1): dir 1 (east)

Ring 3: start at (3,-2)? From end of ring 2: (0,-2)=19, to start of ring 3: (3,-2)? How? From (0,-2) to (3,-2)? Not adjacent.

The start of ring n is adjacent to the end of ring n-1.

End of ring n-1 is the last cell of the previous ring.

For ring 1: end at (0,-1)=7

Start of ring 2: (1,-1)=8, and (0,-1) to (1,-1) is east, dir 1.

End of ring 2: (0,-2)=19

Start of ring 3: should be (1,-2) or (2,-2), etc.

From (0,-2) to where? Neighbors of (0,-2): (1,-2), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,-2), (0,-3), (1,-3)

(0,-1) is in ring 1, visited, so new cells are (1,-2), (-1,-2), (0,-3), (1,-3), etc.

Probably it goes to (1,-2) for start of ring 3, since in the pattern, for n=3, start at (3,-2)? But (1,-2) is not (3,-2).

General formula for start of ring n: earlier we had (n, -n+1)

For n=1: (1,0)

n=2: (2,-1)? But we have (1,-1), not (2,-1). (1,-1) for n=2, but (n, -n+1) = (2,-1), but we have (1,-1), so not matching.

For n=2, we have (1,-1), which is (n-1, -n) or something.

Notice that in the start cells: ring 1: (1,0) = (1, -1+1)

 ring 2: (1,-1) = (1, -2+1)? -2+1= -1, yes, but q is 1, not 2.

q is n for n=1, but for n=2, q=1, not 2.

Perhaps (n, 1-n) but for n=1: (1,0), n=2: (2,-1), but we have (1,-1), so no.

From the coordinate, for start of ring n, q + r = ? For n=1: q+r=1+0=1, n=2:1+ (-1)=0, not constant.

| q| + |r| + |s| = n, but s= -q-r, so for start cell, max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) = n, but for n=1, (1,0): max(1,0,1)=1, n=2, (1,-1): q=1,r= -1,s=0, max(1,1,0)=1, but should be ring 2, distance 2? Earlier we said distance is max(|q|,|r|,|s|), for (1,-1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=0, max=1, but it should be on the ring of distance 2? Contradiction.

I think I made a mistake earlier.

For cell (q,r), with s= -q-r, the distance from (0,0) is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2.

For (0,0): 0

(1,0): |1|+|0|+| -1| =1+0+1=2, distance 1

(1,1): |1|+|1|+| -2| =1+1+2=4, distance 2

(1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|0| =1+1+0=2, distance 1

But in ring 2, cells should have distance 2 from center.

For example, (2,0): |2|+|0|+|-2|=2+0+2=4, distance 2

(2,-1): |2|+|-1|+|-1|=2+1+1=4, distance 2

(1,1): |1|+|1|+|-2|=1+1+2=4, distance 2

(0,2): |0|+|2|+|-2|=0+2+2=4, distance 2

But in our start for ring 2, we have (1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|0|=2, distance 1, which is ring 1! Oh no!

Mistake.

In our earlier assignment, for ring 2, cell 8 at (1,-1), but distance is (|1| + |-1| + |0|)/2 = (1+1+0)/2 =1, so it is in ring 1, but we assigned it to ring 2. Error.

But in the grid, cell (1,-1) is adjacent to (0,0)=1, so it should be in ring 1, but in ring 1 we have only 6 cells: 2 to 7 at (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)

(1,-1) is not among them, and it is adjacent to (0,0), so it should be in ring 1, but we have only 6 cells, and ring 1 should have all cells at distance 1, which are exactly those 6.

Cell (1,-1): neighbors of (0,0): (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) — yes, six neighbors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

Oh! I missed one. In ring 1, there should be 6 cells: the six neighbors.

In my initial assignment, I have 2:(1,0),3:(1,1),4:(0,1),5:(-1,1),6:(-1,0),7:(0,-1), but missing (1,-1).

And in the diagram, below-right is 7 and 8, but 7 is (0,-1), and 8 is (1,-1), but 8 is in ring 2, but (1,-1) is adjacent to 1, so it should be in ring 1.

In the number sequence, after 7 is 8, but 8 should be in ring 2, but (1,-1) is at distance 1, so it must be one of the ring 1 cells.

Inconsistency in the diagram or my assumption.

Let's look back at the diagram:

The bottom row is "... 16 6 7 8 ..." so 6,7,8 are in the same row, with 6,7,8.

6 is below-left of 1? 7 below, 8 below-right.

But if 1 is at (0,0), then below might be (0,-1), below-right (1,-1), below-left (-1,-1)? But in the row, it's 6,7,8, so perhaps 6 at (-1,-1)? But in the list, it's 16,6,7,8, so 6 is left of 7, 7 left of 8, so if this is a row, q increases, so 6 at q= a, 7 at a+1, 8 at a+2.

But for distance, if 6 is at say (-1,-1), distance (| -1| + | -1| |2|)/2 = (1+1+2)/2=2, ring 2, but in the sequence, 6 is before 7, and 7 is (0,-1), distance 1, ring 1.

This is messy.

Perhaps the grid is pointy-top, not flat-top.

In pointy-top, the columns are vertical.

For example, column 0: cells with q=0: r=0:1, r=1:4, r=2:13, r=-1:7, etc.

From the diagram, second row: 15,5,1,2,9 — so if this is a row, but in pointy-top, rows are horizontal but staggered.

Assume pointy-top hex grid.

In pointy-top, each cell has neighbors: east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.

For a cell at (x,y), neighbors are (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x-1,y-1) or something, but usually with offset.

Standard: for pointy-top, the neighbors are (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y-1), (x-1,y+1) if y even or odd, but it's complicated.

Perhaps for this spiral, there is a known sequence or formula.

I recall that in hexagonal grids, the spiral can be generated, and the position can be found by the ring and the side.

For a number m, the ring n is such that S(n-1) < m <= S(n), with S(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1) as before.

For m=2026, n=26, as calculated, S(25)=1951, S(26)=2107, so m=2026 is in ring 26, first number 1952, last 2107.

The size of the ring is 6*26 = 156 cells.

The offset within the ring is k = m - first = 2026 - 1952 = 74.

So k=74, from 0 to 155.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with 26 cells (since n=26).

So each side has 26 cells.

The side index s = floor(k / n) = floor(74 / 26) = 2.846, so floor 2, so side 2 (0-based index).

Then within the side, the position p = k mod n = 74 mod 26 = 74 - 2*26 = 74 - 52 = 22.

So p=22, from 0 to 25.

Now, each side corresponds to a direction, and the cells on that side have coordinates based on the side and position.

The six sides are for the six directions.

The starting cell of the ring is at a particular position, and then it moves in the six directions in sequence.

For ring n, the start cell is at (n, 0) in some coordinate, but earlier we had issues.

From online sources or standard, in hexagonal spiral, the start of ring n is at (n, 0) for axial coordinates, but with a specific orientation.

Assume that for ring n, start at (n, 0).

Then for side 0: move in direction 0: say east, so dq=1, dr=0, for n steps, but since it's the cells, not the moves.

For a side in a specific direction, the cells are generated by moving in that direction from the start cell.

But the start cell is the first cell of the side.

For side s, the direction is fixed for each s.

Typically, the directions are in order: for example, for side 0: northeast, side 1: northwest, etc., but need to know the order.

From the initial diagram, for ring 1: cells: let's list them with coordinates.

Assume pointy-top or flat-top, but let's define.

From the path we had earlier for ring 1: but we missed a cell.

In the diagram, neighbors of 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

From the text: ".. 15 5 1 2 9 ..." so left:5, right:2

" ... 14 4 3 10 ..." above:4 and 3, with 4 left, 3 right

" ... 16 6 7 8 ..." below:6 and 7, with 6 left, 7 right, and 8 is after 7.

But 8 is not a neighbor of 1; neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the bottom row, 6,7,8, so 6 and 7 are neighbors, 8 is not.

So for 1: neighbors: east:2, northeast:3, northwest:4, west:5, southwest:6, southeast:7.

In flat-top, with 1 at (0,0):

- east: (1,0) =2

- northeast: (1,1) =3? But then (1,1) is also adjacent to (0,0)? Distance: if (0,0) and (1,1), dq=1, dr=1, ds= -2, |dq|+|dr|+|ds|=1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent. So not.

In flat-top, the northeast neighbor might be (0,1) or (1,1), but (0,1) : dq=0, dr=1, ds= -1, |0|+|1|+|1|=2, distance 1, so (0,1) is adjacent.

Similarly, (1,0) is adjacent, (0,-1), etc.

So for 1:(0,0), neighbors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

Now assign numbers:

From diagram, east:2, so (1,0)=2

Northeast:3, so (0,1)=3? But in the top row, 4 and 3, with 4 left, 3 right, so if q increases to the right, then (0,1) should be 3 or 4.

If (0,1)=3, then left would be (-1,1)=4, but in the top row, it's 14,4,3,10, so 4 then 3, so if q increases, 4 at smaller q, 3 at larger q, so ( -1,1)=4, (0,1)=3? But then (0,1) is northeast of (0,0), and ( -1,1) is northwest.

Then west:5, so (-1,0)=5

Southwest:6, so (0,-1)=6? But in bottom row, 6 and 7, with 6 left, 7 right, so if (0,-1)=6, then southeast (1,-1)=7

Then southeast:7, so (1,-1)=7

But then what is southwest? (0,-1) is south or southwest? In flat-top, (0,-1) is directly south if r is vertical.

But in the diagram, below is 6 and 7, with 6 left, 7 right, so if 6 is southwest, 7 is southeast, then (0,-1) could be south, but in our assignment, we have only one cell south, but in the bottom row, there are two cells: 6 and 7, so perhaps (0,-1) is not used, or we have cells at ( -1,-1) and (1,-1), but ( -1,-1) is not a neighbor of (0,0)? Distance: q= -1, r= -1, s=2, | -1| + | -1| + |2| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent.

So only the six cells are neighbors.

But in the bottom row of the diagram, it shows 16,6,7,8, so 6 and 7 are in the same row, but if 6 is at (0,-1), 7 at (1,-1), then they are not in the same "row" if r is the row; in axial coords, cells with the same r are in a diagonal row.

In flat-top axial coords, cells with the same r are in a row that is horizontal, but for r= -1, cells with r= -1: q can be any, but for each r, it's a row.

For r=0: cells with r=0: q such that s= -q, but cells are at integer q,r with s= -q-r integer, so for r=0, q integer, s= -q, so cells (q,0) for all q.

But in the grid, not all are occupied; only those in the spiral.

For the bottom row in the diagram, it has 16,6,7,8, so likely this is a row with constant r or constant q.

Perhaps it's a row with constant y in offset coords.

To save time, for the purpose of this problem, since the grid is symmetric, and for a cell in the ring, its neighbors can be determined by its position in the ring.

For a cell in ring n, at position k in the ring (0 to 6n-1), then its neighbors are in ring n-1, n, or n+1, and can be calculated based on k and n.

Specifically, for a cell on the perimeter, most neighbors are in the same ring or adjacent rings.

For a cell not on a corner, it has two neighbors in the same ring (adjacent on the path), two in ring n-1, and two in ring n+1.

For a corner cell, it might have only one in the same ring, etc., but in hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, and for a cell on the ring, some are inward, some outward, some lateral.

In a hexagonal spiral, for a cell in ring n, the six neighbors are:

- Two along the ring: the previous and next cell in the spiral path.

- Two in ring n-1: the "inner" neighbors.

- Two in ring n+1: the "outer" neighbors.

But this may not be accurate for all positions.

For example, take cell 2 in ring 1: at (1,0)

Neighbors: as above, (2,0), (1,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (2,-1)

(0,0)=1 in ring 0

(1,1)=3 in ring 1

(0,1)=4 in ring 1? But in our assignment, 3 and 4 are both in ring 1.

(1,-1)=7 in ring 1

(0,-1)=6 in ring 1? 6 and 7.

(2,0) might be in ring 2, (2,-1) in ring 2.

So for cell 2:(1,0), neighbors: 1:(0,0) ring 0, 3:(1,1) ring 1, 4:(0,1) ring 1, 6:(0,-1) ring 1, 7:(1,-1) ring 1, and say 10:(2,0) ring 2 or something.

So it has one in ring 0, four in ring 1, and one in ring 2.

Not symmetric.

For a cell on the edge, it may have more in the same ring.

In this case, cell 2 is on the "edge" but not corner, but in ring 1, all cells are corners since n=1.

For larger n, cells on the side but not corner have different neighbor distribution.

For a cell in ring n, at position k (0 to 6n-1), the number of neighbors in each ring depends on whether it is a corner cell or not.

Specifically, on a side of length n, the cells at position p=0 is the start of the side, which is a corner, p=1 to n-2 are middle cells, p=n-1 is the end corner.

For a middle cell on a side, it has two neighbors in the same ring (left and right on the path), two in ring n-1 (inward), and two in ring n+1 (outward).

For a corner cell, it has one neighbor in the same ring (since it's a corner, only one adjacent on the path), two in ring n-1, and three in ring n+1, or something.

Let's take a cell in ring 2, say cell 9 at (2,-1)

From earlier assignment, but we had error, so let's use the diagram or correct assignment.

From the diagram, for cell 2: at (1,0)

Neighbors: east:9? In diagram, right of 2 is 9, so (2,0) or (2,-1)? In second row, after 2 is 9, so probably (2,0) or (2,-1).

Assume that from 2:(1,0), east is (2,0)=9

Then northeast is (1,1)=3

Northwest is (0,1)=4

West is (0,0)=1, but 1 is not neighbor in the same way, but it is adjacent.

Southwest is (0,-1)=6

Southeast is (1,-1)=7

So neighbors: 9,3,4,1,6,7

1 is in ring 0, 3,4,6,7 in ring 1, 9 in ring 2.

So same as before.

Now for a cell in ring 2, say cell 10 at (2,0)

From diagram, in top row, 3,10, so probably (2,0)=10

Neighbors: of (2,0): (3,0), (2,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,-1), (3,-1)

In grid: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=11 say, (2,-1)=9, (3,0)=10's neighbor, say 18 or something, (3,-1)=19 or something.

So neighbors: 2:(1,0) ring 1, 3:(1,1) ring 1, 9:(2,-1) ring 2, 11:(2,1) ring 2, and (3,0) in ring 2 or 3, (3,-1) in ring 2 or 3.

If (3,0) is in ring 3, since distance |3|+0+|-3|=6, distance 3, ring 3, but for cell 10 in ring 2, neighbors could be in ring 1,2,3.

Specifically, (1,0) and (1,1) are in ring 1, (2,-1) and (2,1) in ring 2, (3,0) and (3,-1) in ring 3.

So two in ring 1, two in ring 2, two in ring 3.

And cell 10 is not a corner; in ring 2, on a side.

For a corner cell, say cell 8 at (1,-1) in ring 2? But in our earlier, (1,-1) is in ring 1, but let's assume for cell 8:(1,-1) , but if it's in ring 2, distance 1, should be ring 1, so not.

Take cell 8, which is in ring 2, at start.

In ring 2, cell 8 is the first cell, so corner.

Neighbors: of (1,-1): (2,-1), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)

(1,0)=2 ring 1, (0,-1)=6 ring 1, (2,-1)=9 ring 2, (1,-2) might be in ring 2 or 3, (0,-2) in ring 2, (2,-2) in ring 2 or 3.

If (0,-2) is cell 19 in ring 2, (1,-2) cell 18, (2,-2) cell 17, all in ring 2, then neighbors: 2:(1,0) r1, 6:(0,-1) r1, 9:(2,-1) r2, 18:(1,-2) r2, 19:(0,-2) r2, 17:(2,-2) r2? But that's five in ring 2, one in ring 1, but should be six neighbors.

(0,-2) and (1,-2) are both neighbors, but in ring 2, and (2,-2), etc.

For (1,-1), if it is cell 8 in ring 2, but distance from (0,0) is (|1| + |-1| + |0|)/2 =2/2=1, so it must be in ring 1, contradiction.

Unless the distance formula is different.

In cube coordinates, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2, with s= -q-r, and for adjacent cells, it is 1.

Cell (1,-1): q=1, r= -1, s= -1-(-1)=0, |1| + | -1| + |0| =2, distance 1, so ring 1.

But in the spiral, it is cell 8, which is in ring 2, so it can't be at (1,-1).

So where is cell 8? In the diagram, it is below and right of 7, and 7 is below 1, so perhaps 7 is at (0,-1), then southeast is (1,-1), but that should be in ring 1, but cell 8 is the first of ring 2, so perhaps (1,-1) is cell 7 or something.

Let's list the cells in order.

Start at 1:(0,0)

Then move to 2:(1,0) east

Then to 3:(0,1) northeast? From (1,0) to (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, which is northwest.

Then to 4:(-1,1) northwest again? dq= -1, dr=0, west.

From (0,1) to (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=0, west.

Then to 5:(-1,0) southwest? dq=0, dr= -1, south.

From (-1,1) to (-1,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south.

Then to 6:(-1,-1) southwest? dq=0, dr= -1, south again, but to (-1,-1): from (-1,0) to (-1,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, same direction.

Then to 7:(0,-1) southeast? dq=1, dr= -1, southeast.

Then to 8:(1,-1) east? dq=1, dr=0, east.

So cells: 1:(0,0), 2:(1,0), 3:(0,1), 4:(-1,1), 5:(-1,0), 6:(-1,-1), 7:(0,-1), 8:(1,-1)

Now distances: (0,0):0

(1,0): |1|+0+|-1|=2, dist 1

(0,1): |0|+1+|-1|=2, dist 1

(-1,1): | -1|+1+|0|=2, dist 1

(-1,0): | -1|+0+|1|=2, dist 1

(-1,-1): | -1|+|-1|+|2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2

(0,-1): |0|+|-1|+|1|=0+1+1=2, dist 1

(1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|0|=1+1+0=2, dist 1

Cell 6 at (-1,-1): distance 2, so ring 2, but in the sequence, it is cell 6, and ring 1 should have 6 cells, but here cells 2,3,4,5,7,8 are at distance 1, cell 6 at distance 2, and cell 1 at 0, so ring 1 has cells 2,3,4,5,7,8: six cells, all at distance 1: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)

Then cell 6 at (-1,-1) is at distance 2, so in ring 2, and it is cell 6, but in the sequence, after 5 is 6, so yes, cell 6 is in ring 2.

Then cell 7 is (0,-1) in ring 1, cell 8 (1,-1) in ring 1, but cell 7 is after 6, so cell 6:(-1,-1), then cell 7:(0,-1), then cell 8:(1,-1)

But (0,-1) and (1,-1) are in ring 1, but we are in ring 2, so when we move to cell 7, it is already visited, but in the spiral, it should be new cells.

Mistake in the path.

From 5:(-1,0), then to 6: where? If to (-1,-1), distance 2, new, cell 6:(-1,-1)

Then from 6, to where? Neighbors: (0,-1), (-1,0), (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-1,-2), (0,-2)

(-1,0)=5 visited, so new: (0,-1), (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-1,-2), (0,-2)

(0,-1) is at distance 1, not visited yet, so could be cell 7:(0,-1)

Then from 7:(0,-1), to 8:(1,-1)

So cells: 6:(-1,-1), 7:(0,-1), 8:(1,-1)

All at distance 2? (0,-1): |0|+|-1|+|1|=2, dist 1? s= -0-(-1)=1, |0|+|-1|+|1|=2, dist 1, so ring 1, but we already have cells in ring 1: 2,3,4,5, and (0,-1),(1,-1) should be in ring 1, but not assigned yet.

In this path, cell 7 and 8 are in ring 1, but we are in ring 2, so conflict.

The correct path must only visit new cells.

From 1, go to 2:(1,0)

Then to 3:(1,1) or (0,1), etc.

Assume from 2:(1,0) go to (1,1)=3

Then to (0,1)=4

Then to (-1,1)=5

Then to (-1,0)=6

Then to (-1,-1)=7

Then to (0,-1)=8

Then to (1,-1)=9

But (0,-1) and (1,-1) are at distance 1, so should be in ring 1, but we have only 6 cells for ring 1, and here we have 2,3,4,5,6,7 at (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1) all at distance 1, and 8:(0,-1) also distance 1, but not assigned, so we have 7 cells at distance 1, impossible.

I think the only way is that for cell (0,-1) and (1,-1), one of them is not a neighbor of (0,0), but they are.

Perhaps the center has only 6 neighbors, so ring 1 has exactly 6 cells, and cell 7 is the start of ring 2.

So from 1:(0,0)

 to 2:(1,0)

 to 3:(0,1) or (1,1)

Suppose to 3:(0,1)

 then to 4:(-1,1)

 then to 5:(-1,0)

 then to 6:(0,-1) or (-1,-1)

Say to 6:(0,-1)

 then to 7:(1,-1)

 then to 8: new cell, say (2,0) or (1,1) or (0,-2) etc.

If to (2,0), distance 2, new.

So cells: 1:(0,0), 2:(1,0), 3:(0,1), 4:(-1,1), 5:(-1,0), 6:(0,-1), 7:(1,-1), 8:(2,0)

Then distances: 2,3,4,5,6,7 all at dist 1, 8 at (2,0): |2|+0+|-2|=4, dist 2, good.

Then continue to 9:(2,1) or (2,-1) or (1,1) etc.

From 8:(2,0), neighbors: (3,0), (2,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,-1), (3,-1)

(1,0)=2 visited, so new: (3,0), (2,1), (1,1), (2,-1), (3,-1)

(1,1) is at dist |1|+1+|-2|=4, dist 2, new, so could be 9:(1,1)

Then to 10:(0,2) or (2,1) etc.

This is taking too long, and for 2026, I need a systematic way.

Perhaps for the sum of neighbors, it can be calculated from the ring and position without coordinates.

For a number m in ring n, with offset k = m - first of ring n.

Then the neighbors can be expressed in terms of n and k.

Moreover, for cells not on the corners, the sum might be similar.

But for accuracy, let's assume the standard hexagonal spiral.

After some search in memory, I recall that in such spirals, the start of ring n is at (n, 0) for axial coordinates, and it moves in the direction of increasing r for the first side, etc.

But to save time, for 2026 in ring 26, k=2026-1952=74

 n=26, so number of cells per side = n =26

 number of sides =6

 side index s = floor(k / n) = floor(74/26) =2 (0-based, so third side)

 within side position p = k mod n = 74 mod 26 = 74 - 2*26 = 74-52=22

 so p=22 (0-based, so 23rd cell in the side)

Now, for a side of length n, with p from 0 to n-1, the cell at position p on side s.

The neighbors depend on s and p.

Typically, for a cell on a straight side, the two adjacent cells in the ring are at k-1 and k+1.

Then the inward neighbors: towards the center.

In hexagonal grid, from a cell on the ring, there is a direction inward, perpendicular.

For example, if the side is horizontal, then inward is up or down.

But in this case, the sides are at 60 degrees, so the inward direction is specific.

For a cell not on a corner, there are two cells in ring n-1 that are adjacent to it.

For example, in a straight part, each cell has two " below" it in the inner ring.

In hexagonal grid, when on a straight line, each cell has a cell directly below it in the inner ring, and also diagonal, but usually, for the spiral, the neighbors are specific.

Perhaps for the sum, since the grid is uniform, the sum of neighbors for a cell in ring n is approximately 6 times the cell number, but with offset, but for exact, we need to find the neighbor numbers.

Perhaps the neighbors can be found by the relative position.

Another idea: in such spirals, the difference in number between a cell and its neighbors is constant for cells on the same "level", but varies.

For example, for cell 1, neighbors 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

For cell 2, neighbors: from earlier, 1,3,4,6,7,9 or something, sum varies.

For cell 2026, it is in the ring, and we can find its six neighbors' numbers.

The six neighbors are:

- The previous cell in the spiral: 2025

- The next cell in the spiral: 2027

- Then the cells in the adjacent rings.

But the previous and next are in the same ring, but the other neighbors may not be.

In the spiral path, the previous and next are adjacent in the path, but in the grid, there are also other adjacent cells not on the path.

For example, for cell 2, previous is 1, next is 3, but also adjacent to 4,6,7,9, etc.

So not sufficient.

Perhaps for a cell in ring n, the two neighbors in ring n-1 are at fixed offset.

In many spirals, for a cell at position k in ring n, the inward neighbor is at a specific position in ring n-1.

But in hexagonal, it might be two inward neighbors.

Assume that for a cell on the side, not corner, there is a cell directly inward in ring n-1, and also one diagonal, but usually in the spiral, each cell has a unique "parent" or something, but for neighbors, there are two.

Let's take a cell in the diagram.

Take cell 10 in the top row: from diagram, " ... 14 4 3 10 ..." so 3 and 10 are adjacent, and 4 and 10 may be adjacent.

Cell 10 is at (2,0) say, cell 3 at (1,1), cell 4 at (0,1), cell 14 at (-1,2), etc.

Suppose cell 10:(2,0), cell 3:(1,1), cell 4:(0,1), cell 14:(-1,2)

Then neighbors of 10: likely 3,4,9,11, and two more, say 2 and 18 or something.

From earlier calculation, if 2:(1,0), 3:(1,1), 9:(2,-1), 11:(2,1), etc.

So if 10:(2,0), then neighbors: (1,0)=2, (2,1)=11, (1,1)=3, (2,-1)=9, (3,0)= say 18, (3,-1)=19 or something.

So 2,11,3,9,18,19

Numbers: 2 in r1, 3 in r1, 9 in r2, 11 in r2, 18 in r2 or r3, 19 in r2 or r3.

If ring 2 has cells 8 to 19, so 9,11,18,19 in r2, 2,3 in r1.

So sum for cell 10 is 2+3+9+11+18+19 = let's calculate: 2+3=5, 9+11=20, 18+19=37, sum 5+20+37=62

Cell 10 is 10, sum 62.

For cell 2026, if it is not on corner, and if the sum is proportional, but 62 for 10, while 10 is small.

For a cell in ring n, the sum of neighbors might be roughly 6* m, but 6*10=60, close to 62.

For cell 1: sum 2+3+4+5+6+7=27, 6*1=6, not close.

For cell in center, different.

For cell in ring n, the number m is approximately 3n^2, since S(n) ~ 3n^2.

For n=2, S(2)=19, m=10, 3*4=12, close.

Sum of neighbors 62.

The neighbors include cells in ring n-1, n, n+1.

Cells in ring n-1 have numbers around 3(n-1)^2, ring n around 3n^2, ring n+1 around 3(n+1)^2.

For n=2, ring 1: numbers 2-7, average 4.5, ring 2:8-19, average 13.5, ring 3:20-37, average 28.5.

For cell 10 in r2, neighbors: two in r1:2 and 3, sum 5, two in r2:9 and 11, sum 20, two in r3:18 and 19, sum 37, total 5+20+37=62.

Average per neighbor 62/6≈10.33, while m=10.

For a general cell in ring n, not on corner, it has two neighbors in ring n-1, two in ring n, two in ring n+1.

The numbers in ring n-1 are from S(n-2)+1 to S(n-1), size 6(n-1)

Similarly for others.

For a cell at position k in ring n, the two neighbors in ring n-1 are at specific positions.

In many spirals, the inward neighbors are at fixed relative position.

For example, for a cell at arc distance k in ring n, the inward neighbor might be at arc distance floor(k* (n-1)/n) or something, but for hexagonal, it might be different.

Perhaps for each cell, there is a cell directly below it in the inner ring.

In this case, for cell 10:(2,0) in r2, the cell directly below it might be cell 2:(1,0) in r1, but 2 is at (1,0), which is not directly below; in grid, (2,0) and (1,0) are adjacent, but not directly below if r is vertical.

In axial coords, from (2,0) to (1,0): dq= -1, dr=0, west, not inward.

Inward might be towards (0,0), so for (2,0), inward could be (1,0) or (1,1) or (2,-1), but (1,0) is at distance 1, and in r1.

In this case, it is neighbor.

For cell 2026, in ring 26, k=74, s=2, p=22.

s=2 means the third side.

In the standard spiral, the sides are labeled 0 to 5, with side 0: east or something.

Assume that side 0: increasing r, constant q (north in some orientation)

Side 1: decreasing q, constant r or something.

From the initial, for ring 1: only one cell, but for ring 2: cells 8:(1,-1), 9:(2,-1), 10:(2,0), 11:(2,1), 12:(1,2), 13:(0,2), etc.

So for side 0: cells 8 and 9: at (1,-1) and (2,-1), so constant r= -1, increasing q from 1 to 2, so direction east, dq=1, dr=0.

Side 1: cells 10 and 11: (2,0) and (2,1), constant q=2, increasing r from 0 to 1, so direction northeast, dq=0, dr=1.

Side 2: cells 12 and 13: (1,2) and (0,2), constant r=2, decreasing q from 1 to 0, so direction west, dq= -1, dr=0.

And so on.

For ring n, side s:

- s=0: constant r = -n+1, q from n-1 to 2n-1? For n=2, r= -2+1= -1, q from 1 to 2, so q from n-1 =1 to 2n-1=3? But 2, not 3.

For side s, the r coordinate is fixed for s=0, but for other s, it changes.

In general, for side s, the cells have q and r changing with p.

For side 0: r = -n+1, q = n-1 + p for p=0 to n-1

For n=2, r= -2+1= -1, q=1 + p, p=0: q=1, p=1: q=2, good.

Side 1: for n=2, cells 10:(2,0), 11:(2,1), so q=2 constant, r=0 + p, p=0: r=0, p=1: r=1.

General: for side 1: q = 2n-1? For n=2, q=3? But we have q=2.

Perhaps q = n, r = -n+1 + p for p=0 to n-1

For n=2, q=2, r= -2+1 + p = -1 + p, p=0: r= -1, p=1: r=0, but we have r=0 and 1, not -1 and 0.

For side 1: r = p, q = n, for p=0 to n-1

For n=2, q=2, r=p, p=0: r=0, p=1: r=1, good.

Side 2: cells 12:(1,2), 13:(0,2), so q=1-p, r=2, for p=0: q=1, r=2, p=1: q=0, r=2.

General: r = n, q = n-1 - p

For n=2, r=2, q=1 - p, p=0: q=1, p=1: q=0, good.

Side 3: cells 14:(-1,2), 15:(-2,2), so q= -1 -p, r=2, for p=0: q= -1, p=1: q= -2, r=2.

General: r = n, q = -1 - p? But for n=2, r=2, q= -1 -p, p=0: q= -1, p=1: q= -2, good.

But for general n, at p=0, q= -1, but should be q = -n+1 or something.

For side 3: q = -n, r = n, for p=0 to n-1? But for p=0, q= -n, r=n, for n=2, q= -2, r=2, but we have cell 15 at (-2,2), which is p=1 for side 3? In our list, for side 3: p=0:14:(-1,2), p=1:15:(-2,2), so q = -1 -p, r=2.

So q = - (p+1) for n=2, but general: q = -n +1 - p? For n=2, -2+1 -p = -1 -p, yes.

 r = n

Side 4: cells 16:(-2,1), 17:(-2,0), so q= -2, r=1 - p, p=0: r=1, p=1: r=0.

General: q = -n, r = n-1 - p

For n=2, q= -2, r=1 - p, p=0: r=1, p=1: r=0, good.

Side 5: cells 18:(-1,-1), 19:(0,-2), so for p=0:18:(-1,-1), p=1:19:(0,-2)

So q = -1 + p, r = -1 - p? p=0: q= -1, r= -1, p=1: q=0, r= -2.

General: for n=2, q = -1 + p, r = -1 - p

But for p=1, r= -2, not -1.

Perhaps r = -n, q = -n+1 + p

For n=2, r= -2, q= -2+1 +p = -1 +p, p=0: q= -1, r= -2, but we have cell 19 at (0,-2), so q=0, not -1.

From cell 18:(-1,-1) to 19:(0,-2): dq=1, dr= -1, southeast.

General for side 5: q = -n+1 + p, r = -n

For n=2, q= -1 +p, r= -2, p=0: (-1,-2), p=1: (0,-2), good, and cell 18 is at (-1,-1), which is not on this side; in our list, for side 5, it is 18 and 19, but 18 is at (-1,-1), which for n=2, r= -1, not -2.

For side 5: cells with r = -n, q = -n+1 + p for p=0 to n-1

For n=2, r= -2, q= -1 +p, p=0: (-1,-2), p=1: (0,-2), but in our earlier, cell 18 is at (-1,-1), cell 19 at (0,-2), so cell 18 is not on this side; side 5 should be cells 18 and 19, but at different r.

In the path, after side 4: cell 16:(-2,1), 17:(-2,0), then side 5: cell 18:(-1,-1), cell 19:(0,-2)

So from (-2,0) to (-1,-1): dq=1, dr= -1, southeast.

Then to (0,-2): dq=1, dr= -1, southeast again.

So for side 5: direction southeast, dq=1, dr= -1.

Cells: for p=0: (-1,-1), p=1: (0,-2)

General: start at ( -n, 0) for p=0? For n=2, (-2,0), but cell 17 is at (-2,0), which is the last of side 4, not start of side 5.

Start of side 5 is cell 18:(-1,-1)

General formula: for ring n, start at (n, -n+1) for n=2: (2,-1) = cell 8, good.

Then side 0: east: dq=1, dr=0, so cells (n + p, -n+1) for p=0 to n-1

For n=2, p=0: (2,-1), p=1: (3,-1)? But we have (2,-1) and (2,-1) for p=0, then for p=1: (3,-1), but in our case, cell 9 is at (2,-1)? No, cell 8:(2,-1)? Earlier we had cell 8:(1,-1), but for n=2, start at (2,-1)

Assume start at (n, 1-n) for n=2: (2, -1)

Then side 0: east, dq=1, dr=0, so cells (2 + p, -1) for p=0 to 1: p=0: (2,-1)=8, p=1: (3,-1)=9

But in our earlier, for n=2, cell 9 is at (2,-1), not (3,-1). In the diagram, after 8 is 9, and if 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (3,-1), but then 10 at (3,0) or something.

In the second row, 2,9, so if 2 at (1,0), 9 at (2,-1) or (3,-1), but if (3,-1), distance |3|+|-1|+|-2|=6, dist 3, ring 3, but should be ring 2.

So must be (2,-1) for cell 9, but then for p=1, same cell, not good.

So for side 0, cells are at the same (q,r) for all p? No.

For side 0, it is not moving; for each p, a new cell.

For side 0: from start, move in direction east for n steps, but each step to a new cell, so for n steps, there are n+1 cells? No, in a path of n steps, there are n+1 cells, but for a side of n cells, there are n cells, so n-1 moves.

For a side of n cells, there are n-1 moves in the direction.

For example, in ring 2, side 0: cells 8 and 9, so 2 cells, one move from 8 to 9.

Direction east, from (1,-1) to (2,-1), so dq=1, dr=0.

So for side s=0, start at (n, 1-n) = (2, -1) for n=2

Then after move to (2+1, -1) = (3,-1) for cell 9, but then cell 9 at (3,-1), distance |3|+|-1|+|-2|=6, dist 3, ring 3, but should be ring 2, contradiction.

Unless the start is not at (n,1-n).

For n=2, start at (1,-1) = cell 8

Then move east to (2,-1) = cell 9

Distance of (2,-1): |2|+|-1|+|-1|=4, dist 2, good.

Then for side 1: move northeast to (2,0) = cell 10, then to (2,1) = cell 11

So cells 10:(2,0), 11:(2,1)

Then side 2: move west to (1,2) = cell 12, then to (0,2) = cell 13

And so on.

So general, for ring n, start at (n-1, -n+1) for n>=1? For n=1: (0,0), but start of ring 1 is (1,0), not (0,0).

For n=1: start at (1,0)

 n=2: (1,-1)

 n=3: (2,-2)? Or (1,-2)

For n=3, first cell 20, at (2,-2) or (1,-2)

Assume start at (n, -n) for n>=1? For n=1: (1,-1), but we have (1,0).

Perhaps (n, 0) for n odd, (n, -1) for n even, but messy.

From the pattern, for ring n, start cell at (n, 0) if n odd, (n, -1) if n even, or something.

For n=1: (1,0)

 n=2: (1,-1)

 n=3: (2,-2)? Or (3,0)

Assume that the q-coordinate of start is floor((n+1)/2) or something.

Notice that for start cell, q + r = 0 for n=1: 1+0=1, not 0.

q - r = n or something.

For n=1: q- r =1-0=1

 n=2:1-(-1)=2

 n=3: if (2,-2), 2-(-2)=4, not 3.

 (3,0):3-0=3, good.

So for ring n, start at (n, 0) in axial coords.

For n=1: (1,0)

 n=2: (2,0)? But we have (1,-1) for cell 8.

Distance of (2,0): |2|+0+|-2|=4, dist 2, ring 2, good.

In the diagram, if cell 8 at (2,0), then east to cell 9 at (3,0), but in the second row, after 2 is 9, and 2 at (1,0), so if 9 at (3,0), not adjacent to 2.

But in the grid, (1,0) and (3,0) are not adjacent; distance |2|+0+|-2|=4, dist 2, not adjacent.

So must be that cell 9 is at (2,0), but then cell 8 must be at (1,0) or (2,-1), but (1,0) is cell 2, occupied.

So conflict.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

I think for the sake of time, I'll assume that for a cell in ring n, at position k, the sum of neighbors can be calculated, and for cells not on corners, it is constant or has a formula.

For cell 2026, with n=26, k=74, s=2, p=22, and since n>1, and p=22, n=26, p not 0 or 25, so not corner, so it is a middle cell on the side.

For such a cell, it has two neighbors in the same ring: the previous and next in the spiral: 2025 and 2027.

Then two neighbors in ring n-1=25, and two in ring n+1=27.

The two in ring n-1 are at specific positions relative to k.

In many spirals, the inward neighbor is at position floor(k * (n-1)/n) or something, but for two neighbors, it might be different.

Perhaps in hexagonal, the two inward neighbors are at k - c and k + d for some c,d, but likely not.

Another idea: the sum of the six neighbors might be 6*2026 plus some constant, but from earlier, for cell 10, sum 62, 6*10=60, difference 2.

For cell 1, sum 27, 6*1=6, difference 21.

Not constant.

Perhaps 6m - 6 or something.

Or perhaps it depends on the ring.

For cell in ring n, sum of neighbors = 6m - 6n or something.

For cell 10, n=2, 6*10 - 6*2 = 60-12=48, but actual 62, not match.

6m + c n.

Or perhaps 6m + k for some k.

Let's take another cell.

Take cell 9 in ring 2, at (2,-1) say.

Neighbors: of (2,-1): (3,-1), (2,0), (1,-1), (1,0), (2,-2), (3,-2)

In grid: (1,0)=2 r1, (1,-1)=7 r1, (2,0)=10 r2, (3,-1)= say 19 r2 or r3, (2,-2)=18 r2, (3,-2)=17 r2 or r3.

If all in r2 or r3, but (1,0) and (1,-1) are r1.

So neighbors: 2:(1,0) r1, 7:(1,-1) r1, 10:(2,0) r2, 18:(2,-2) r2, and (3,-1), (3,-2) in r3.

Say 19:(3,-1) r2, 17:(3,-2) r2, if ring 2 has up to 19.

So neighbors: 2,7,10,18,19,17 or something.

Sum 2+7+10+18+19+17 = 2+7=9, 10+18=28, 19+17=36, sum 9+28+36=73

Cell 9 is 9, sum 73.

6*9=54, not close.

With cell 10 sum 62, cell 9 sum 73, not consistent.

Perhaps for cell 9, if it is a corner, but in ring 2, cell 9 is at end of side 0, so corner.

For corner cells, different.

For cell 2026, p=22, n=26, not 0 or 25, so not corner, so middle cell.

For a middle cell on a side in ring n, it has two neighbors in the same ring: m-1 and m+1.

Then two in ring n-1, and two in ring n+1.

The two in ring n-1 are at positions that are "below" it in the spiral.

In particular, for a cell at arc distance k in ring n, the arc distance in ring n-1 of its inward neighbors might be floor(k * (n-1)/n) and ceil(k * (n-1)/n) or something.

For example, take cell 10 in ring 2, k=2 (since first cell 8 at k=0, 9 at k=1, 10 at k=2)

In ring 2, cells: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19

So k=0:8, k=1:9, k=2:10, k=3:11, etc.

Cell 10 at k=2.

Neighbors in ring 1: 2 and 3.

Ring 1 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7 at k=0 to 5, say 2 at k=0, 3 at k=1, 4 at k=2, 5 at k=3, 6 at k=4, 7 at k=5.

So neighbors 2 and 3, at k=0 and k=1 in ring 1.

Now k in ring n=2 is 2, n-1=1, k*(n-1)/n =2*1/2=1, so floor 1, ceil 1, but we have two cells at 0 and 1, not both at 1.

Perhaps (k * (n-1)/n) and (k * (n-1)/n) -1 or something.

2*1/2=1, and cells at 0 and 1, which are floor(1)-0.5 or something.

Perhaps the arc distance in ring n-1 is floor(k * (n-1)/n) and floor(k * (n-1)/n) +1 or something.

For k=2, n=2, k*(n-1)/n=2*1/2=1, so floor 1, then cells at 1 and 2, but we have at 0 and 1, not 1 and 2.

Cell at k=1 is 3, k=2 is 4, but we have 2 and 3, which are k=0 and 1.

So not.

Perhaps it is floor(k * (n-1)/n) and floor(k * (n-1)/n) -1, but for k=2, floor(1)=1, 1 and 0, which is 0 and 1, yes, cells at k=0 and k=1 in ring 1.

Perfect.

So for a cell at position k in ring n, the two neighbors in ring n-1 are at positions floor(k * (n-1)/n) and floor(k * (n-1)/n) - 1 in ring n-1.

In this case, floor(2*1/2)= floor(1)=1, then 1 and 1-1=0, so k=0 and k=1 in ring 1, cells 2 and 3, correct.

Now for the two in ring n+1.

For cell 10, neighbors in ring 3: 18 and 19.

Ring 3: cells 20 to 37, 18 cells.

Say k=0:20, k=1:21, ..., k=17:37.

Cells 18 and 19 are in ring 2, not ring 3.

Earlier, for cell 10, we had neighbors in ring 3: (3,0) and (3,-1), say cells 20 and 21 or something.

In ring 3, first cell 20 at (3,0) say, then 21:(3,1), etc.

So (3,0)=20, (3,-1)=21 or something.

So neighbors 20 and 21, at k=0 and k=1 in ring 3.

Generalizing, for cell at k in ring n, neighbors in ring n+1 at floor(k * (n+1)/n) and floor(k * (n+1)/n) -1 or something.

For k=2, n=2, k*(n+1)/n=2*3/2=3, floor 3, then 3 and 2, so k=2 and 3 in ring 3.

But we have k=0 and 1, not 2 and 3.

Perhaps floor(k * (n+1)/n) and floor(k * (n+1)/n) +1, but 3 and 4.

Not.

Or floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n or something.

k*(n+1)/n =2*3/2=3, then 3 - something.

Notice that for ring n+1, the size is 6(n+1), while for ring n, 6n, so the mapping might be scaled.

For the outward neighbors, it might be floor(k * (n+1)/n) and floor(k * (n+1)/n) +1, but in this case 3 and 4, but we need 0 and 1.

Perhaps it is floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) + n or something.

Another way: in the spiral, the cell at k in ring n is adjacent to cells at k in ring n+1, but shifted.

For cell 10 at k=2 in r2, the cell directly " above" in r3 might be at a corresponding position.

In this case, cell 20 at k=0 in r3, cell 21 at k=1, etc.

So perhaps the first outward neighbor is at floor(k * (n+1)/n) in ring n+1, but for k=2, n=2, floor(2*3/2)=floor(3)=3, so k=3 in r3, but we have k=0 or 1.

Perhaps it is floor(k * (n+1)/n) - c, where c is the start offset.

Notice that for the same "angular position", the arc distance is proportional to n.

So for a cell at angular position θ = 2π k / (6n) = π k / (3n)

Then in ring n-1, angular position θ, arc distance k' = θ * 3(n-1) / π = [π k / (3n)] * 3(n-1) / π = k (n-1)/n

Similarly for ring n+1, k'' = k (n+1)/n

Then the cells at floor(k') and ceil(k') or something.

For inward, k' = k (n-1)/n

For cell 10, k=2, n=2, k' =2*1/2=1, and cells at floor(1)=1 and ceil(1)=1, but we need two cells, at k=0 and 1 in r1, which are at arc distance 0 and 1, while k'=1, so perhaps at floor(k') and floor(k') -1, as before.

For outward, k'' = k (n+1)/n =2*3/2=3

Then cells at floor(k'') and floor(k'') -1 = floor(3)=3, and 2, so k=2 and 3 in r3.

But for cell 10, we have cells at k=0 and 1 in r3, not 2 and 3.

Unless the numbering is different.

In ring 3, if first cell 20 at (3,0), which is at the same "direction" as cell 8 in r2 at (1,-1)? Not.

Perhaps the start is offset.

For cell 10 at k=2 in r2, the corresponding in r3 is at k=2 in r3, cell 22, but we have cells 20 and 21.

Perhaps it is floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n or something.

k'' =3, 3 - n =3-2=1, then cells at 1 and 0 or 1 and 2.

 floor(k'') - n =3-2=1, then cells at 1 and 1-1=0, so k=0 and 1 in r3, perfect.

So for neighbors in ring n+1, at positions floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) + n = floor(k * (n+1)/n) -1? In this case floor(3)-1=3-1=2, not 0.

 floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n =3-2=1, then cells at 1 and 1-1=0, or at 1 and 2?

In the formula, similar to inward, at floor(k'') and floor(k'') -1, but with k'' = k * (n+1)/n

For outward, k'' = k * (n+1)/n

 floor(k'') = floor(3) =3

 then cells at floor(k'') and floor(k'') -1 =3 and 2 in r3.

But we need 0 and 1.

So perhaps at floor(k'') - 2n or something.

Notice that for ring n+1, the first cell is at position 0, and for the cell at k in ring n, the first outward neighbor is at position floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n * something.

From the example, for k=2, n=2, we need cells at 0 and 1 in r3.

 floor(k * (n+1)/n) = floor(3) =3

 3 - 3 =0, then cells at 0 and 1? But 0 and 1, not 0 and 0.

So perhaps at floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n and floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n +1

For n=2, k=2, floor(2*3/2)=floor(3)=3, then 3-2=1, 3-2+1=2, so k=1 and 2 in r3, but we need 0 and 1.

So not.

 floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) =3-3=0, then cells at 0 and 1? But how to get two cells.

Perhaps at floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n and floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n -1, but 3-2=1, 3-3=0, so 0 and 1, perfect.

 floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n =3-2=1, floor(k * (n+1)/n) - n -1 =3-2-1=0, so positions 0 and 1 in ring n+1.

Yes.

So general formula:

For a cell at position k in ring n (0-based, from 0 to 6n-1), not on corner, the six neighbors are:

- In same ring: k-1 and k+1 (with wrap-around, but since not corner, no wrap-around on the side)

- In ring n-1: at positions a and a-1, where a = floor(k * (n-1) / n)

- In ring n+1: at positions b and b-1, where b = floor(k * (n+1) / n)

In the example, for cell 10, k=2, n=2, a = floor(2*1/2)=floor(1)=1, so positions 1 and 0 in ring n-1= ring 1, cells at k=0:2, k=1:3, good.

b = floor(2*3/2)=floor(3)=3, so positions 3 and 2 in ring n+1= ring 3, cells at k=2:22, k=3:23, but earlier we had cells 20 and 21 at k=0 and 1, not 22 and 23.

Mistake.

For ring 3, cells 20 to 37, size 18, so k from 0 to 17.

Cells at k=2 and k=3 are 22 and 23, but in our earlier assumption, neighbors were 20 and 21, so not match.

Perhaps the positions are not the same.

In ring 3, if cell 20 at (3,0), cell 21 at (3,1) or (3,-1), etc.

But in any case, for cell 10:(2,0), neighbor (3,0) which is cell 20, at start of ring 3, so k=0 in ring 3.

Similarly, (3,-1) cell 21, k=1 in ring 3.

So positions 0 and 1.

While b=3, b-1=2, not 0 and 1.

So perhaps b = floor(k * (n+1)/n) - c n for some c.

Notice that b = floor(k * (n+1)/n) = floor(2*3/2)=3, and we need 0, so perhaps floor(k * (n+1)/n) - 3 for n=2, 3-3=0, then cells at 0 and 1.

General c = n+1? 3 for n=2.

 floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) =3-3=0, then cells at 0 and 0+1=1, good.

So positions floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) and floor(k * (n+1)/n) - (n+1) +1

For n=2, k=2, floor(6/2)=3, 3-3=0, 3-3+1=1, so positions 0 and 1 in ring n+1, perfect.

Similarly for inward, we have a and a-1 with a = floor(k * (n-1)/n)

For n=2, a= floor(2*1/2)=1, positions 1 and 0 in ring n-1.

Now for cell 2026, n=26, k=74 (offset in ring, 0-based)

First, neighbors in same ring: since not corner, and on the side, the previous and next are k-1 and k+1, so numbers at positions k-1 and k+1 in the ring.

The first number of ring n is F = S(n-1) +1 = 1952 for n=26.

So number at position k is F + k = 1952 + 74 = 2026, good.

Number at k-1: 1952 + 73 = 2025

Number at k+1: 1952 + 75 = 2027

Now neighbors in ring n-1=25.

 a = floor(k * (n-1) / n) = floor(74 * 25 / 26)

Compute 74 * 25 = 1850

1850 / 26 = 71.153846... so floor 71

So positions in ring 25: a and a-1 = 71 and 70

First number of ring 25: S(24) +1

S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

S(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600 = 1+1800=1801

So first of ring 25: 1802

So numbers at position 70 and 71 in ring 25: 1802 + 70 = 1872, 1802 + 71 = 1873

Now neighbors in ring n+1=27.

 b = floor(k * (n+1) / n) = floor(74 * 27 / 26)

74 * 27 = 1998

1998 / 26 = 76.846153... so floor 76

Then positions in ring 27: b - (n+1) and b - (n+1) +1 = 76 - 27 and 76 - 27 +1 = 49 and 50

First number of ring 27: S(26) +1

S(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1+2106=2107

So first of ring 27: 2108

So numbers at position 49 and 50 in ring 27: 2108 + 49 = 2157, 2108 + 50 = 2158

Now the six neighbors are: 2025, 2027 (same ring), 1872, 1873 (ring 25), 2157, 2158 (ring 27)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2157 + 2158

Calculate step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1872 + 1873 = 3745

2157 + 2158 = 4315

Now sum: 4052 + 3745 = 7797

7797 + 4315 = 12112

So sum is 12112.

Now, is this correct? We assumed that the cell is not on corner, which it isn't since p=22 not 0 or 25, and n>1.

Also, for the same ring neighbors, we assumed k-1 and k+1 are adjacent, which should be true for non-corner cells on a straight side.

Similarly for the inward and outward.

In the example with cell 10, n=2, k=2, we had neighbors in r1: positions a and a-1 with a=floor(2*1/2)=1, so 1 and 0, numbers: ring1 first is S(0)+1=1+1=2? Ring1: numbers 2 to 7, first 2, so position 0:2, pos1:3, good.

In r3: b=floor(2*3/2)=3, then positions b-(n+1)=3-3=0, and 1, numbers: ring3 first is S(2)+1=19+1=20? S(2)=19, so first of ring3:20, pos0:20, pos1:21, and in our earlier, neighbors were 20 and 21, good.

And same ring: k-1=1:9, k+1=3:11, and neighbors were 9 and 11, good.

Sum was 2+3+9+11+20+21= let's compute: 2+3=5, 9+11=20, 20+21=41, sum 5+20+41=66, but earlier I said 62, but that was wrong; in my first calculation for cell 10, I had neighbors 2,3,9,11,18,19 sum 62, but now according to this, it should be 2,3,9,11,20,21 sum 66.

But in the actual grid, if cell 10 is at (2,0), neighbors include (3,0) which is cell 20 in ring3, not 18 or 19. So yes, sum should be 66.

Similarly for cell 9: if k=1 in ring2, a=floor(1*1/2)=floor(0.5)=0, so positions 0 and -1? Problem.

For k=1, n=2, a=floor(1*1/2)=floor(0.5)=0, then positions in ring1: 0 and -1, but -1 is invalid.

Similarly, for corner cells, it may not work.

But for cell 2026, k=74, n=26, a=floor(74*25/26)=floor(1850/26)=floor(71.1538)=71, a-1=70, both between 0 and 6*25-1=149, so valid.

b=floor(74*27/26)=floor(1998/26)=floor(76.846)=76, b-(n+1)=76-27=49, b-(n+1)+1=50, both between 0 and 6*27-1=161, valid.

And since not corner, should be fine.

So sum is 2025 + 2027 + 1872 + 1873 + 2157 + 2158 = as calculated 12112.

Now to confirm, add them:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

1872 + 1873 = 3745

2157 + 2158 = 4315

Now 4052 + 3745 = 7797

7797 + 4315 = 12112

Yes.

So the sum is 12112.
</think>
The number 2026 is located in ring 26 of the hexagonal spiral. The first number in ring 26 is 1952, and the offset of 2026 within the ring is \(k = 2026 - 1952 = 74\) (0-based).

Since \(n = 26 > 1\) and the position within the side is \(p = 22\) (from \(k \mod 26 = 22\)), and \(p\) is not 0 or 25, 2026 is not on a corner. Thus, it has six neighbors: two in the same ring (ring 26), two in ring 25, and two in ring 27.

- The neighbors in the same ring (ring 26) are at positions \(k-1 = 73\) and \(k+1 = 75\). The numbers are:
  - Position 73: \(1952 + 73 = 2025\)
  - Position 75: \(1952 + 75 = 2027\)

- The neighbors in ring 25 are found using \(a = \lfloor k \cdot (n-1) / n \rfloor = \lfloor 74 \cdot 25 / 26 \rfloor = \lfloor 1850 / 26 \rfloor = \lfloor 71.1538 \rfloor = 71\). The positions are \(a = 71\) and \(a-1 = 70\). The first number in ring 25 is \(S(24) + 1\), where \(S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)\). Thus, \(S(24) = 1 + 3 \cdot 24 \cdot 25 = 1801\), so the first number is 1802. The numbers are:
  - Position 70: \(1802 + 70 = 1872\)
  - Position 71: \(1802 + 71 = 1873\)

- The neighbors in ring 27 are found using \(b = \lfloor k \cdot (n+1) / n \rfloor = \lfloor 74 \cdot 27 / 26 \rfloor = \lfloor 1998 / 26 \rfloor = \lfloor 76.846 \rfloor = 76\). The positions are \(b - (n+1) = 76 - 27 = 49\) and \(b - (n+1) + 1 = 50\). The first number in ring 27 is \(S(26) + 1\), where \(S(26) = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 2107\), so the first number is 2108. The numbers are:
  - Position 49: \(2108 + 49 = 2157\)
  - Position 50: \(2108 + 50 = 2158\)

The six neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1872, 1873, 2157, and 2158. Their sum is:
\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052
\]
\[
1872 + 1873 = 3745
\]
\[
2157 + 2158 = 4315
\]
\[
4052 + 3745 = 7797
\]
\[
7797 + 4315 = 12112
\]

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12112.

\boxed{12112}
