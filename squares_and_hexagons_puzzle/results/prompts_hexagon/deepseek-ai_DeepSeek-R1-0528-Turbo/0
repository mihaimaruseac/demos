<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on this hexagonal grid.

From the example, it starts with 1 in the center, then 2 to the right, 3 above and to the right, 4 above and to the left, 5 below and to the left, 6 below and to the right, 7 to the right again, and so on. Let me sketch this out based on the given numbers.

The grid shows:

... 14  4  3  10 ...

.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

... 16  6  7  8 ...

So, assuming a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. The center is 1. Directly to the right is 2. Above and to the right is 3. Above and to the left is 4. Below and to the left is 5. Below and to the right is 6. Then to the right of 2 is 9? But 7 and 8 are also there. Looking at the sequence: after 6, it's 7 and 8. In the diagram, below 6 is 7, and to the right of 7 is 8? But then above 8 is 9? The diagram shows 9 to the right of 2? That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps I need to interpret the layout. In hexagonal grids, the rows are offset. Looking at the diagram:

The second row is: 15, 5, 1, 2, 9

First row: 14, 4, 3, 10? But it's shown with dots, so probably incomplete.

Third row: 16, 6, 7, 8

So, likely, the grid is arranged such that the center row has five cells: 15,5,1,2,9? But 1 is center, so probably symmetric.

Perhaps the center is 1, with neighbors: above-left:4, above-right:3, right:2, below-right:6, below-left:5, and then left is something? But in the diagram, to the left of 1 is 5? But 5 is below-left? I'm confused.

Let me list the positions relative to center.

Assume center cell is 1.

The cell directly to the right: 2.

The cell above and to the right: 3.

The cell above and to the left: 4.

The cell directly to the left: 5? But in the diagram, below 4 is 14? This is messy.

From the diagram, in the row below: 16,6,7,8. So below 1 is 6? But 6 is below-right or below-left?

Perhaps I should assign coordinates. In hexagonal grids, there are different coordinate systems. One common system is axial coordinates.

I recall that in a hexagonal spiral, the arrangement can be described by rings.

For example, the center cell is ring 0, containing only 1.

Then ring 1 has 6 cells: 2 through 7? But in the diagram, after 1 is 2,3,4,5,6,7? But 8 is also there, and 9,10, etc.

From the diagram: near center, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,16.

Sequence: 1 (center), then clockwise or counterclockwise.

From 1, to right is 2. Then above-right is 3. Then above-left is 4. Then left is 5? But in diagram, below 4 is 14? That can't be.

Look at the second row: it has 15,5,1,2,9. So cells are: left of 1 is 5? But then below 5 is 15? And below 1 is 6? But 6 is in the third row with 16,6,7,8.

Third row: 16,6,7,8 — so probably 6 is directly below 1, then 7 to the right of 6, 8 to the right of 7.

Then above 1, we have 4 and 3. First row has 14,4,3,10. So 4 is above-left of 1, 3 is above-right of 1, then 14 left of 4, 10 right of 3.

Then left of 1 is 5, and below 5 is 15.

Right of 1 is 2, below 2 is 9? But in the diagram, below 2 is not shown, but in the third row it's 6,7,8, so below 2 should be something else.

The third row has only four cells: 16,6,7,8, while the center row has five: 15,5,1,2,9. So it's not symmetric; probably the grid is not fully shown, and it's expanding.

Perhaps the spiral goes: start at 1, then move right to 2, then down-right to 3? But in diagram, after 2 is not 3; 3 is above.

Standard hexagonal spiral might start at center, then move in a direction, but here it seems after 1, it goes to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right), then to 4 (up-left), then to 5 (left), then to 6 (down-left), then to 7 (down-right), then to 8 (right), then to 9 (up-right), etc.

Let's list the numbers in order.

From the diagram, and sequence: 1 at center.

Neighbors: let's list the six directions.

Assume the six directions are: E (east), NE (northeast), NW (northwest), W (west), SW (southwest), SE (southeast).

From center 1:

- E: 2

- NE: 3

- NW: 4

- W: 5? But in diagram, to the left of 1 is 5, and below 5 is 15, but 15 is larger, so probably 5 is west.

Then SW: 6? But in diagram, below 1 is 6? But SW is below-left, SE is below-right.

In the third row, 6 is directly below? But in hexagonal grid, "directly below" might be SW or SE depending on orientation.

To clarify, let's see the neighbors of 1.

From the diagram, cells adjacent to 1 should be 2,3,4,5,6, and perhaps another? But in the center row, it's 15,5,1,2,9 — so adjacent are 5 (left), 2 (right), and above and below? But in hexagonal grid, there are six neighbors.

Probably, above-left:4, above-right:3, below-left:6? But in third row, 6 is there, and below-right: something else.

Look at cell 6: in the third row with 16,6,7,8. So neighbors of 6: left is 16? But 16 is larger, so probably not adjacent. Above is 1? If 6 is directly below 1, then yes. Then right is 7, and below-right is 8? But 8 is to the right, so perhaps SE is 7, E is 8? This is confusing.

Perhaps the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops. In the diagram, the first row has cells offset, but here the rows are shown horizontally, so likely flat-top hexagons, so each row is horizontal, and neighbors are E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.

For a cell, the neighbors are: left and right in the same row, then up-left and up-right in the row above, down-left and down-right in the row below.

In this case, for cell 1 in the center row, neighbors are:

- left: 5

- right: 2

- up-left: 4 (since in the row above, cell to the left)

- up-right: 3 (cell to the right in row above)

- down-left: ? in the row below, which has 6,7,8, so probably the cell below-left of 1 is 6, since 6 is directly below or below-left.

In the third row, it starts with 16, then 6, so likely 6 is below-left of 1, and below-right of 1 is 7? But 7 is to the right of 6, so if 6 is directly below 1, then below-right would be the cell to the right of below, but in hexagonal grid, if flat-top, the row below is offset, so for cell 1, the cell directly below might not be directly below, but offset.

To simplify, from the diagram:

- Above-left of 1: 4

- Above-right of 1: 3

- Left of 1: 5

- Right of 1: 2

- Below-left of 1: 6 (since in third row, first cell is 16, but 6 is next, and 16 is probably below-left of 5 or something)

- Below-right of 1: ? not shown, but in the center row, to the right of 2 is 9, and below 2 might be something, but in third row, after 6,7,8, and 8 is below-right of 2? Let's see.

Cell 2 is in center row, right of 1.

Neighbors of 2: left is 1, right is 9 (from diagram), up-right is 3 (since 3 is above-right of 1, and adjacent to 2), up-left is 1? or 4? probably only 1 and 3.

In hexagonal grid, for cell 2, neighbors should be: left:1, right:9, up-left:1? no, up-left should be the cell above and left, which for cell 2, since it's in the same row as 1, up-left might be 4 or 3. Typically, if flat-top, the up-left neighbor is the cell directly above in the row above, but shifted.

From the numbers, cell 3 is above-right of 1, and since 2 is right of 1, so 3 is up-right of 2? Let's calculate the distance.

Perhaps it's easier to see the sequence of numbering.

Let me try to list the order in which cells are filled.

Start at 1.

Then move in some direction to 2. From the diagram, 2 is to the right of 1.

Then from 2, where to next? If it's a spiral, it should turn. In the diagram, above 2 is not filled yet, but above-right is 3, but 3 is already there? No, 3 is filled after 2? The numbers are sequential, so 1, then 2, then 3, etc.

So after 1, place 2 to the right.

Then place 3 above and to the right of 1, which is also above-left of 2? In hexagonal grid, the cell above-right of 1 is adjacent to both 1 and 2, so after placing 2, it might be adjacent, but in spiral, it might continue.

Typically in spirals, after placing a cell, you move to the next cell in the direction, but when you hit an occupied cell or boundary, you turn.

For hexagonal spiral, there are standard ways.

I recall that for a hexagonal grid, the spiral can be described by rings, and each ring has 6k cells for k>=1, with the first ring (k=1) having 6 cells.

Let me calculate the ring number.

Define ring 0: cell 1.

Ring 1: cells 2 through 7? But in the diagram, after 1 is 2,3,4,5,6,7, then 8 is next, but 8 is in ring 2 or still ring 1?

From the diagram: 1 (center), then around it: 2 (E), 3 (NE), 4 (NW), 5 (W), 6 (SW), 7 (SE), then what next? After 7, it should go to the next ring. In the diagram, after 7 is 8, which is to the right of 7, and 7 is SE of 1, so SE of 7 might be the next.

In the third row, we have 7 and 8, and 8 is to the right of 7, so probably 8 is E of 7.

Then after 8, it might go up to 9, which is above-right of 8 or something. In the diagram, to the right of 2 is 9, and 2 is in center row, 9 is also in center row, so E of 2 is 9.

But 8 is in the row below, so probably after 7 (SE of 1), then 8 (E of 7), then 9 (NE of 8 or something), but in the diagram, 9 is in the center row, so likely it moves up.

From 8, it might move NE to 9, but 9 is above and to the right of 8.

In the diagram, cell 8 is in the third row, cell 9 is in the center row, so not adjacent if rows are horizontal.

Perhaps the rows are not horizontal; but in the diagram, it's shown with rows, so likely they are.

Let's list all cells shown:

Row 1 (top): cells at positions: let's say x-coordinates. Assume the center cell 1 is at (0,0).

Then row above (row 0): cells at y=1 or something. Usually, in flat-top hex grid, we can use axial coordinates with q and r.

Set for cell 1: (0,0).

Cell 2: to the right, so (1,0) if we assume x increases right, y constant for row.

Then cell 3: above-right, so in hexagonal grid, if flat-top, moving NE increases x by 1, y by 1? Standard axial coordinates: let's define q and r, with s = -q-r.

For cell at (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1).

For cell 1 at (0,0):

- (1,0): cell 2

- (0,1): ? 

- (-1,1): ? 

- (-1,0): cell 5 (assume)

- (0,-1): cell 6 (assume)

- (1,-1): ? 

From the diagram, cell 3 is above-right, which might be (1,1) or (0,1)? Let's see adjacency.

Cell 2 at (1,0) should be adjacent to cell 3. Cell 3 is above-right of 1, so if 1 is (0,0), 2 is (1,0), then above-right of 1 could be (1,1) or (0,1). (1,1) would be adjacent to (1,0) and to (0,1)? Distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is |1-0| + |1-0| + | -2 - (-1)| no, in axial, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2, but for adjacency, |dq| + |dr| + |ds| = 2, and they differ in two coordinates by 1.

For example, from (0,0), neighbor at (1,0): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1, sum |1| + |0| + |-1| = 2, good.

(0,1): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -1, sum 2.

( -1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds=0, sum 2.

( -1,0): dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, sum 2.

(0,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, sum 2.

(1,-1): dq=1, dr= -1, ds=0, sum 2.

So six neighbors.

Now, from diagram, cell 3 is above-right of 1. If "above" means increasing r, "right" increasing q, then (1,1).

Similarly, cell 4 above-left, so decreasing q, increasing r, so (-1,1).

Cell 5 left, so decreasing q, (-1,0).

Cell 6 below, so decreasing r, (0,-1).

Then cell 7 below-right, so increasing q, decreasing r, (1,-1).

Then cell 8: from diagram, in the same row as 6 and 7, which is r= -1, and to the right of 7, 7 is at (1,-1), so right would be (2,-1).

Then cell 9: in the center row, to the right of 2, 2 is at (1,0), so right is (2,0).

Then cell 10: in the top row, to the right of 3, 3 is at (1,1), so right is (2,1).

Cell 14: to the left of 4, 4 is at (-1,1), so left is (-2,1).

Cell 15: below 5, 5 is at (-1,0), below is (-1,-1)? But in diagram, below 5 is 15, and in the row below, we have 16 at left, then 6,7,8, so at r=-1, we have cells at q= -2? 16, then -1? 6 is at (0,-1), so probably at r=-1, cells from q= -2 to q=2 or something.

From diagram, third row: 16,6,7,8 — so likely q= -2,-1,0,1? But 6 is at (0,-1), 7 at (1,-1), 8 at (2,-1), so 16 at (-2,-1).

Similarly, center row: 15,5,1,2,9 — so q= -2,-1,0,1,2? 15 at (-2,0), 5 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 9 at (2,0).

Top row: 14,4,3,10 — so q= -2,-1,1,2? Missing q=0? But cell at (0,1) should be there? In the diagram, it's not shown, but probably it's filled later or something. Cell 3 is at (1,1), 4 at (-1,1), so (0,1) should be between them, but not listed, so perhaps it's not filled yet or is filled later.

The sequence of numbering: 1 at (0,0)

Then 2 at (1,0)

Then 3 at (1,1)  // above-right

Then 4 at (-1,1)  // above-left? but from 3 to 4, it jumped over (0,1)

In spiral, after placing 3, it might move to the left, so to (0,1), but in the diagram, (0,1) is not listed, and the numbers are 1,2,3,4,... so after 3 is 4, which is at (-1,1), but (0,1) is adjacent, so why skip it?

Perhaps the spiral path is different. Let's list the order based on the numbers.

From the diagram and sequence, likely:

- 1: (0,0)

- 2: (1,0)  // right

- 3: (1,1)  // up-right

- 4: (0,1) ? but in diagram, above 1 is not filled, but in the top row, between 4 and 3 is empty, but 4 is at (-1,1), 3 at (1,1), so (0,1) is missing.

Perhaps (0,1) is cell 10 or something, but 10 is at (2,1) or something.

In the top row, it's 14,4,3,10, so 4 at some q, 3 at higher q, 10 at even higher, so likely 4 at q=-1,r=1, 3 at q=1,r=1, 10 at q=2,r=1, and 14 at q=-2,r=1.

So (0,1) is not present, which means that for r=1, only even q or something? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the grid is not fully populated; the spiral adds cells as it goes.

Let's think about the spiral order.

Start at 1 (0,0).

Move in direction E to 2 (1,0).

Then turn left (counterclockwise) to NE, to cell at (1,1)? But (1,1) is adjacent to (1,0), so place 3 at (1,1).

Then turn left to NW, which would be to (0,1)? From (1,1), moving NW would be to (0,1) or (0,2)? In axial, from (q,r), moving NW is to (q-1,r+1) or (q,r+1)? Typically, the six directions are defined as vectors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) for E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE or something.

Standard hexagonal direction vectors:

Let's define:

- E: (1,0)

- NE: (0,1)  // if we use (q,r) with r vertical

- NW: (-1,1)

- W: (-1,0)

- SW: (0,-1)

- SE: (1,-1)

From (0,0):

- E: (1,0)

- NE: (0,1)

- NW: (-1,1)

- W: (-1,0)

- SW: (0,-1)

- SE: (1,-1)

Now, from cell 2 at (1,0), after placing it, the next cell in the spiral. Typically, after placing a cell, you continue in the same direction if possible, but when you can't, you turn.

From (1,0), if you are moving E, but E from (1,0) is (2,0), but in the diagram, next is not (2,0), but 3 at (1,1), which is NE from (1,0).

Perhaps the initial move is different.

After placing 1 at (0,0), you move E to (1,0) for 2.

Then from there, instead of continuing E, you turn to NE to (1,1) for 3, because continuing E would be outside or something, but at this point, no cells are occupied except the path, so why turn?

In many spirals, you turn after placing a cell if the cell to the "left" is free, but in this case, it's a bit different.

Perhaps for hexagonal, the spiral is such that after placing the first cell, you move in a direction, and after each side, you turn.

Let's look at the sequence from the diagram.

From the given:

Cell 1 at (0,0)

Cell 2 at (1,0)

Cell 3 at (1,1)  // assume

Cell 4 at (0,1)? but in diagram, cell at (0,1) is not shown, but cell 4 is at (-1,1) in the top row with 14 and 3, but 3 is at (1,1), so if 4 is at (-1,1), then (0,1) is missing, which is odd.

Unless (0,1) is cell 11 or something, but not listed.

Perhaps the cell at (0,1) is filled later. Let's see the number at (0,1).

From the spiral order, after placing 1,2,3, then next should be 4. If from 3 at (1,1), if you move NW, to (0,1), then place 4 at (0,1).

Then from there, move W to (-1,1), place 5? but in diagram, 5 is at (-1,0), not (-1,1).

This is not matching.

Perhaps from 3 at (1,1), move W to (0,1), but then to ( -1,1), but in diagram, cell at (-1,1) is 4, and cell at (0,1) is not 5.

Let's list the cells with their numbers from the diagram.

From top row: cells at r=1: q= -2: 14, q= -1: 4, q=1: 3, q=2: 10. So no cell at q=0,r=1.

Center row r=0: q= -2: 15, q= -1: 5, q=0: 1, q=1: 2, q=2: 9.

Bottom row r= -1: q= -2: 16, q= -1: ? not shown, but from third row: 16,6,7,8, so likely q= -2:16, q= -1: ? , q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8.

But cell at q= -1,r= -1 is not listed, but probably it is cell 11 or something.

In the bottom row, between 16 and 6, there should be a cell at q= -1,r= -1.

Similarly, in the top row, between 4 and 3, at q=0,r=1, there should be a cell.

But in the diagram, they are not shown, so perhaps they are filled later in the spiral.

Let's try to determine the order.

Start at 1 (0,0).

Move E to 2 (1,0).

Then from 2, move NE to 3 (1,1).

Then from 3, move NW to (0,1), but (0,1) is not occupied, so place 4 at (0,1)? but in the diagram, 4 is at (-1,1), not (0,1).

Perhaps move W from 3 to (0,1), same thing.

Perhaps after 3, it moves to the next ring.

Another idea: perhaps the spiral goes: after 1, move E to 2.

Then turn 60 degrees left, to NE, to 3 (1,1).

Then from 3, instead of continuing, it turns again to NW, but to where? To (0,1) or to (0,2)? But (0,1) is adjacent.

But in the diagram, the cell at (0,1) is not 4; 4 is at (-1,1).

Perhaps from 3 at (1,1), it moves W to (0,1), but then why is it not placed? Perhaps it is placed later.

Let's assume that the cell at (0,1) is cell n, and see what n is.

From the numbers, after 3, it places 4 at (-1,1), but to go from (1,1) to (-1,1), it would need to move two steps W, but that's not adjacent.

So likely, it places 4 at (0,1), but in the diagram, the cell between 4 and 3 is not labeled, but in the top row, it's "4 3" with no cell in between, so probably no cell at (0,1), which means that for r=1, only odd q or something, but q= -1,1,2, not 0, so perhaps the grid is not a full hex grid; but that doesn't make sense for a spiral.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Another thought: in some hexagonal spirals, the cells are arranged in rings, and each ring has cells added in order.

Let me research or recall the standard hexagonal spiral numbering.

I recall that for a hexagonal grid, the number of cells up to ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1) for k>=0, but let's calculate.

For ring 0: 1 cell.

Ring 1: 6 cells, total 7.

Ring 2: 12 cells, total 1+6+12=19.

Ring 3: 18 cells, total 37, and so on, with ring n having 6n cells for n>=1.

The first cell of ring n is at position 1 + 3n(n-1) +1 or something.

The last cell of ring k is at sum from i=0 to k of 6i for i>=1, but for i=0, 1 cell.

So cumulative cells up to ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6* k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1).

For k=0: 1 + 0 =1, good.

k=1: 1 + 3*1*2 = 1+6=7, so cells 1 to 7.

k=2: 1 + 3*2*3 = 1+18=19, cells 1 to 19.

k=3: 1+3*3*4=1+36=37, cells 1 to 37.

Now, in the diagram, we have up to 16, which is less than 19, so ring 2 is not complete.

Cell 1: ring 0.

Cells 2 to 7: ring 1.

Cells 8 to 19: ring 2.

In the diagram, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,16, so up to 16, which is in ring 2.

Now, let's list the cells in ring 1: 6 cells.

Typically, they are at positions around the center.

From center (0,0), the six directions.

Let's say:

- E: (1,0) cell 2

- SE: (1,-1) cell 7? or cell 6

- SW: (0,-1) cell 6? 

- W: (-1,0) cell 5

- NW: (-1,1) cell 4

- NE: (0,1) cell 3? but earlier we had issue with (0,1)

In standard, for ring 1, cells are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1).

Yes, that's the six neighbors.

So:

- (1,0): cell 2

- (0,1): cell 3

- (-1,1): cell 4

- (-1,0): cell 5

- (0,-1): cell 6

- (1,-1): cell 7

Oh! I see, in the diagram, cell 3 is at (0,1), not (1,1). I misread the diagram.

Look back at the diagram:

Top row: ... 14  4  3  10 ...

But if cell 3 is at (0,1), cell 4 at (-1,1), then in the top row, it should be cell at q= -2,r=1:14, q= -1,r=1:4, q=0,r=1:3, q=1,r=1:? but in diagram it's "3 10", so probably q=1,r=1 is 10 or something.

In the diagram, it shows "14 4 3 10", so likely the cells are at consecutive q for r=1, so q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10? but cell 3 is at q=0,r=1, but in the sequence, 3 is small, 10 is larger, so probably not.

Perhaps the row is not continuous; in hexagonal grid with flat top, for a given r, q ranges, but cells are not at all integer q; in axial coordinates, for each r, q can be any integer, but the grid is infinite, so all (q,r) are present.

But in the spiral, cells are added in order.

With the standard assignment:

Cell 1: (0,0)

Ring 1:

Cell 2: (1,0)  // E

Cell 3: (0,1)  // NE? depending on definition

Cell 4: (-1,1) // NW

Cell 5: (-1,0) // W

Cell 6: (0,-1) // SW

Cell 7: (1,-1) // SE

Now, in the diagram, for center row r=0: cells at q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, and also q= -2:15, q=2:9, so for r=0, q from -2 to 2.

But for r=1, top row: cells at q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3? but in diagram it's "14 4 3 10", so if q=0:3, then q=1:10? but cell 10 should be later.

Cell 3 is at (0,1), so in top row, at (0,1) is 3.

Then to its left, at (-1,1) is 4.

To its right, at (1,1) should be another cell, but in diagram it's shown as 10, but 10 is larger than 3,4, so probably not; likely the cell at (1,1) is not yet filled or is cell 8 or something.

In the diagram, after 3 is 10, but 10 is at (2,1) or something.

Let's list the cells from the diagram with this assignment.

From center row r=0: q= -2:15, q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9

Top row r=1: q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, and then q=1:? but diagram shows "3 10", so probably q=1:10

But cell at (1,1) should be in ring 2, since ring 1 has only up to q=1 for r=-1, etc.

Ring 1 has cells at (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1) — so for r=1, only q=0 and q=-1, not q=1.

(0,1) and (-1,1) are in ring 1.

(1,1) is not in ring 1; it is in ring 2.

Similarly, for r=0, in ring 1, only q=1,-1,0? (1,0),(-1,0),(0,0) but (0,0) is center, ring 0.

The cells in ring 1 are only the six neighbors, so for r=0, cells at q=1 and q=-1, i.e., (1,0) and (-1,0).

(0,0) is separate.

In the diagram, for r=0, we have cells at q= -2,-1,0,1,2, so q=0 is center, q=1 and -1 are ring 1, q=2 and -2 are ring 2.

Similarly for other rows.

So for r=1, in ring 1, cells at q=0 and q=-1: cells 3 and 4.

But in the diagram, at r=1, q= -2:14 (ring 2), q= -1:4 (ring 1), q=0:3 (ring 1), q=1:10 (ring 2), since 10>7.

For r= -1, cells: from diagram, q= -2:16, q= -1:? not shown, but likely there is a cell, q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8.

Cell 6 is at (0,-1), ring 1.

Cell 7 at (1,-1), ring 1.

Cell at ( -1,-1) should be in ring 2, cell 11 or something.

Cell at (2,0) is 9, ring 2.

Cell at (-2,0) is 15, ring 2.

Now, the numbering order for ring 1: cells 2 to 7.

Typically, it starts at (1,0) for cell 2, then to (0,1) for cell 3, then to (-1,1) for cell 4, then to (-1,0) for cell 5, then to (0,-1) for cell 6, then to (1,-1) for cell 7.

Yes, that matches the diagram: 2 at (1,0), 3 at (0,1), 4 at (-1,1), 5 at (-1,0), 6 at (0,-1), 7 at (1,-1).

Now for ring 2: cells 8 to 19.

Ring 2 has 12 cells.

The spiral usually starts from the cell adjacent to the last cell of previous ring and in the direction away from center.

Last cell of ring 1 is cell 7 at (1,-1).

From there, the spiral might move in a direction to add the first cell of ring 2.

Typically, it moves in the same direction as it was moving when it finished the previous ring.

From cell 6 to cell 7: cell 6 at (0,-1), cell 7 at (1,-1), so it moved E (since q increased from 0 to 1, r same).

So direction is E: (1,0).

Then from cell 7 at (1,-1), it would continue in the same direction E to (2,-1), but since it's a new ring, it might turn or not.

In many spirals, for hexagonal, it moves to the next cell in the direction perpendicular or something.

Standard way: after finishing a ring, it moves to the next cell in the "forward" direction, but for hexagonal, it often moves in the direction of the last move.

From (1,-1), moving E would be to (2,-1), which is adjacent, and not occupied, so place cell 8 at (2,-1).

In the diagram, at r=-1, q=2:8? But in diagram, at r=-1, we have q=2:8, yes, and earlier cells at q=1:7, q=0:6, so yes, cell 8 at (2,-1).

Then from there, it might turn. Since it's a new ring, it turns 60 degrees left (counterclockwise) to go to the next direction.

From E, turning left (counterclockwise) would be to NE, which is (0,1) direction? Directions: if E is (1,0), turning left (ccw) would be to NE, which is (1,1) or (0,1)? The vector for NE is (0,1) in our axial coords? From (2,-1), moving NE: add (0,1) to (2,0)? But (2,0) is different r.

From current position (2,-1), moving in direction NE: which is (0,1), so to (2+0, -1+1) = (2,0).

Is (2,0) adjacent? Distance from (2,-1) to (2,0): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -1, sum 2, yes adjacent.

And not occupied, so place cell 9 at (2,0).

In diagram, at r=0, q=2:9, yes.

Then continue in NE direction to next cell. From (2,0), move NE to (2,1).

(2+0,0+1)=(2,1), adjacent? Distance to (2,0) is |0|+|1|+|-1|=2, yes.

Place cell 10 at (2,1)? In diagram, at r=1, q=2:10? But in diagram, top row has q=1:10? Earlier I assumed q=1,r=1 is 10, but if (2,1), then q=2,r=1.

In diagram, it shows "3 10" after 4, and 3 is at q=0,r=1, so if next is q=1,r=1:10, but according to this, it should be (2,1).

Inconsistency.

From (2,0), move NE to (2,1), place 10 at (2,1).

But in the diagram, for r=1, we have cells at q=-2,-1,0,1? But (2,1) is q=2,r=1, which might be present.

In the diagram, it shows "14 4 3 10", so likely q=-2:14, q=-1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10? But q=1,r=1 is (1,1), not (2,1).

So if cell 10 is at (1,1), but according to spiral, from (2,0) moving NE to (2,1), not to (1,1).

(1,1) is adjacent to (2,0)? Distance: dq=-1, dr=1, ds=0, sum 2, yes adjacent, but not in the NE direction from (2,0).

From (2,0), NE direction is to (2,1) or (1,1)? The direction NE is defined as (0,1) in axial coords, so adding (0,1) to (2,0) gives (2,1).

Adding (1,-1) would be SE, etc.

So (2,1) is NE of (2,0).

But in the diagram, if (2,1) is cell 10, but the top row shows only up to q=1? The diagram might be incomplete, or perhaps (2,1) is not in the same row.

r=1 is top row, q=2 would be further right.

In the diagram, it shows "3 10" and dots, so probably q=0:3, then q=1:10, so (1,1) for 10.

But according to spiral, it should be at (2,1).

Perhaps the direction is different.

After placing 8 at (2,-1), then instead of moving NE, it moves in another direction.

From (2,-1), the last move was E from (1,-1) to (2,-1), so direction E.

Then for the next cell, in spiral, it might turn left to NE, but to which cell? The cell to the left of the direction.

The adjacent cells: from (2,-1), neighbors are: E:(3,-1), NE:(2,0), NW:(1,0)? NW is (-1,1), so from (2,-1), NW is (2-1,-1+1)=(1,0), but (1,0) is already occupied by cell 2.

Other neighbors: W:(1,-1) occupied by 7, SW:(2,-2)? SW is (0,-1), so (2+0,-1-1)=(2,-2), SE:(1,-2)? SE is (1,-1), so (2+1,-1-1)=(3,-2)? Let's list:

From (q,r) = (2,-1)

- E: (3,-1)

- W: (1,-1) occupied

- NE: (2,0)  // since NE: dq=0,dr=1? earlier I defined NE as (0,1), so (q+0,r+1)=(2,0)

- NW: (-1,1), so (q-1,r+1)=(1,0) occupied

- SE: (1,-1), so (q+1,r-1)? SE is (1,-1) vector? Earlier I said SE: (1,-1), so (2+1,-1-1)=(3,-2)

- SW: (0,-1), so (q+0,r-1)=(2,-2)

So unoccupied neighbors: (3,-1), (2,0), (3,-2), (2,-2)

Now, the last move was from (1,-1) to (2,-1) in direction E (dq=1,dr=0).

In spiral, after moving in a direction, when you need to turn, you turn left (ccw) if the cell to the left is free.

The cell to the "left" of the direction. For direction E (1,0), the left side is NE, which is direction (0,1).

The cell in that direction relative to current position: from (2,-1), the cell at NE: (2,0).

Is it free? Yes. So it should move to (2,0) for cell 9.

In diagram, (2,0) is cell 9, yes.

Then from there, last move was NE (from (2,-1) to (2,0), so direction (0,1).

Now, continue in same direction? To (2,1)? But is it free? Yes. So move to (2,1) for cell 10.

But in diagram, at (2,1) should be cell 10, but in the top row, if r=1, q=2, but in the diagram it's shown as "10" after "3", and 3 is at (0,1), so if they are in same row, q should be consecutive, but (0,1) and (2,1) are not adjacent; there is (1,1) in between.

Moreover, distance between (0,1) and (2,1) is |2|+|0|+|-2|=4>2, not adjacent, so in the row, they are not next to each other.

In the diagram, "14 4 3 10" suggests that 14,4,3,10 are consecutive in the row, so probably q increases, so from q=-2 to q=1 or something.

If 3 is at (0,1), then to its right should be (1,1), so if 10 is at (1,1), but according to spiral, it should be at (2,1).

Contradiction.

Unless the move from (2,0) is not to (2,1), but to another cell.

After placing 9 at (2,0), last direction was NE (0,1).

Now, the cell in front is (2,1), but perhaps it is not free or something, but it is free.

But in spiral, after moving NE to (2,0), it might turn left to the next direction.

The next direction ccw from NE is NW, which is (-1,1) vector.

So from (2,0), move NW: add (-1,1) to (2,0) = (1,1).

Place cell 10 at (1,1).

Then continue in NW direction to (0,2)? Add again (-1,1) to (1,1) = (0,2).

Place cell 11 at (0,2).

Then turn left to W, move to (-1,2), and so on.

In the diagram, cell at (1,1) is present, and if it's cell 10, and in the top row, after 3 at (0,1), next is (1,1):10, which matches the diagram "3 10".

Similarly, (0,2) is not shown, but later.

Then cell 11 at (0,2), cell 12 at (-1,2), etc.

Now, in the diagram, we have cell 14 at (-2,1)? Earlier I had q=-2,r=1:14, but if cell 12 is at (-1,2), etc.

Let's list the sequence for ring 2.

Start from cell 7 at (1,-1).

Move E to (2,-1), place cell 8.

Then turn left to NE, move to (2,0), place cell 9. // since from E to NE is left turn.

Then from (2,0), move in NE direction? But after turning, we are in NE direction, so move to (2,1)? But earlier we decided to turn to NW instead.

In standard hexagonal spiral, after placing the first cell of the ring, it then moves in the next direction.

Typically, for ring n, there are 6 sides, each with n cells.

For ring 2, each side has 2 cells.

The ring starts at a cell adjacent to the end of previous ring, in the direction of the last move.

Last cell of ring 1 is 7 at (1,-1), last move was from 6 at (0,-1) to 7 at (1,-1), so direction E.

So for ring 2, it starts by moving in the same direction E to (2,-1), place cell 8.

Then, since it's the start of a new ring, it turns 60 degrees left (ccw) to the next direction, which is NE (from E, ccw is NE).

Move NE to (2,0), place cell 9.

Now, this is the first cell of the first side. Each side has 2 cells, so far only one cell on this side? No, the side includes the cells added in that direction.

After placing cell 9 at (2,0), it has added one cell in NE direction, but for side 1, it should add two cells.

From (2,0), it should continue in the same direction NE to (2,1), place cell 10.

Then after placing cell 10, it has added two cells for this side (cells 9 and 10 in NE direction).

Then it turns left to the next direction, which is NW (from NE, ccw is NW).

Move NW to (1,1), place cell 11.

Then continue NW to (0,2), place cell 12.

Then turn left to W, move to (-1,2), place cell 13.

Continue W to (-2,2), place cell 14.

Then turn left to SW, move to (-2,1), place cell 15? But (-2,1) is already there? No.

From (-2,2), move SW: SW is (0,-1)? Vector SW is (0,-1), so (-2+0,2-1)=(-2,1), place cell 15.

Then continue SW to (-2,0), place cell 16.

Then turn left to SE? From SW, ccw is SE? Directions in order: let's list the six directions in ccw order: say E, NE, NW, W, SW, SE.

From SW, ccw is SE.

Move SE to (-1,-1)? SE vector (1,-1), so (-2+1,0-1)=(-1,-1), place cell 17.

Then continue SE to (0,-2), place cell 18.

Then turn left to E, move to (1,-2), place cell 19.

Then continue E to (2,-2)? But (2,-2) might be adjacent, but ring 2 should have only 12 cells, cells 8 to 19.

After cell 19 at (1,-2), it should be the end, but we have only 12 cells? Cells 8 to 19 is 12 cells.

But in this path: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(2,1), 11:(1,1), 12:(0,2), 13:(-1,2), 14:(-2,2), 15:(-2,1), 16:(-2,0), 17:(-1,-1), 18:(0,-2), 19:(1,-2).

Now, check if all are distinct and cover ring 2.

The cells at distance 2 from center: max |dq|+|dr|+|ds| = 4? Distance in hex grid is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|), but in axial, distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2? Earlier for adjacency, sum |dq|+|dr|+|ds|=2.

For distance, the Manhattan distance in hex is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) with s=-q-r, but actually the distance is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, and for ring 2, distance should be 2.

For example, (2,-1): |2|+|-1|+|s|=|s|=|-1|=1, sum |q|+|r|+|s|=2+1+1=4, distance 4/2=2.

(2,0): |2|+|0|+| -2|=2+0+2=4, dist 2.

(2,1): |2|+|1|+| -3|=2+1+3=6, dist 3? Oh no, mistake.

s = -q - r, so for (q,r), s = -q-r.

Distance from (0,0) is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2.

For (2,1): q=2,r=1,s=-3, |2|+|1|+| -3|=6, dist 3.

But ring 2 should be distance 2.

Distance 2 cells have |q|+|r|+|s| = 4.

For example, (2,0): q=2,r=0,s=-2, |2|+|0|+|2|=4, dist 2.

(1,1): q=1,r=1,s=-2, |1|+|1|+|2|=4, dist 2.

(0,2): q=0,r=2,s=-2, |0|+|2|+|2|=4, dist 2.

(-2,0): same.

But (2,1): |2|+|1|+| -3|=2+1+3=6, dist 3, which is ring 3.

In the path above, (2,1) is dist 3, not 2.

Error.

For ring 2, cells at dist 2: for example, (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-1), and also (1,0) but (1,0) is dist 1, already occupied.

The cells are those with max(|q|,|r|,|s|) = 2, but since s=-q-r, it's equivalent to |q| + |r| + |s| = 4.

The possible cells: q from -2 to 2, r from -2 to 2, but with |q| + |r| + | -q-r| = 4.

For example:

- (2,0): |2|+|0|+| -2|=4

- (2,-1): |2|+|-1|+| -1|=2+1+1=4? s= -2 - (-1) = -1, |s|=1, sum 2+1+1=4, yes dist 2.

- (1,1): |1|+|1|+| -2|=1+1+2=4

- (1,0): |1|+|0|+| -1|=1+0+1=2, dist 1

- (1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|0|=1+1+0=2, dist 1

- (0,2): |0|+|2|+| -2|=0+2+2=4

- (0,1): |0|+|1|+| -1|=0+1+1=2, dist 1

- (0,0): dist 0

- (0,-1): dist 1

- (0,-2): |0|+|-2|+|2|=0+2+2=4, dist 2

- (-1,2): |-1|+|2|+| -1|=1+2+1=4

- (-1,1): |-1|+|1|+|0|=1+1+0=2, dist 1

- (-1,0): dist 1

- (-1,-1): |-1|+|-1|+|2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2

- (-2,1): |-2|+|1|+|1|=2+1+1=4

- (-2,0): |-2|+|0|+|2|=2+0+2=4

- (-2,-1): |-2|+|-1|+|3|=2+1+3=6, dist 3

- (2,1): |2|+|1|+| -3|=2+1+3=6, dist 3

- etc.

So the 12 cells for ring 2 are: (2,0), (2,-1), (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-2,1), (-1,2), (0,2), (1,2), (2,1)? (2,1) is dist 3.

List all with |q|+|r|+|s| =4, s= -q-r.

So for each (q,r), compute s= -q-r, then |q| + |r| + |s| =4.

Possible q,r integers.

Assume |q| <=2, |r| <=2, but can be larger, but since dist 2, |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |s|<=2, but |s|=|q+r|<=2.

So |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |q+r|<=2.

Cells:

q=2: then |2| + |r| + | -2-r| =2 + |r| + |2+r| =4.

Since r integer, |r| + |2+r| =2.

If r>=0, |r| + |2+r| = r + 2+r =2r+2=2? then 2r=0, r=0.

If r<0, |r|=-r, |2+r|, if r>=-2, |2+r|=2+r if r>=-2, but r<0, so -r + (2+r) =2, always 2, so 2 + 2 =4 >2? The equation is 2 + |r| + |2+r| =4, so |r| + |2+r| =2.

For r>=0: r + (2+r) =2r+2=2? then 2r=0, r=0.

For r<0: let r=-k, k>0, then k + |2 - k|.

If k<=2, |2-k|=2-k, so k +2 -k =2.

If k>2, |2-k|=k-2, k + k-2=2k-2=2? then 2k=4, k=2.

So r=0 or r=-2.

For q=2, r=0: (2,0)

r= -2: (2,-2)

Similarly for q= -2: | -2| + |r| + |2-r| =2 + |r| + |2-r| =4, so |r| + |2-r| =2.

Same as above, r=0 or r=2.

So ( -2,0), (-2,2)

For q=1: |1| + |r| + | -1-r| =1 + |r| + |1+r| =4, so |r| + |1+r| =3.

r integer.

If r>=0, r + (1+r) =2r+1=3, so 2r=2, r=1.

If r<0, |r|=-r, |1+r|, if r>=-1, |1+r|=1+r, so -r +1+r=1<3? not.

If r<-1, |1+r| = -1-r, so -r + (-1-r) = -2r -1 =3, so -2r=4, r= -2.

So r=1 or r= -2.

Cells (1,1), (1,-2)

For q= -1: | -1| + |r| + |1-r| =1 + |r| + |1-r| =4, so |r| + |1-r| =3.

Same as above, r=1 or r= -2.

Cells (-1,1), (-1,-2)

For q=0: |0| + |r| + | -r| =0 + |r| + |r| =2|r| =4, so |r|=2, r=2 or r= -2.

Cells (0,2), (0,-2)

For q=1 and q= -1, we have r=1 and r= -2, but for r=0, not included since |r| + |1+r| = |0| + |1| =1<3.

Similarly for other q.

Now list all:

From q=2: (2,0), (2,-2)

q=1: (1,1), (1,-2)

q=0: (0,2), (0,-2)

q= -1: (-1,1), (-1,-2)

q= -2: (-2,0), (-2,2)

But that's only 10 cells. Missing two.

What about (1,0)? But |1|+|0|+|-1|=2, dist 1.

(2,1): dist 3.

Where are (1,-1), (0,1), etc., all dist 1.

I am considering q=1,r=0: dist 1.

The cells like (2,-1): q=2,r= -1, s= -2-(-1)= -1, |2|+|-1|+|-1|=2+1+1=4, dist 2, yes! I missed it.

Similarly, ( -2,1): |-2|+|1|+|-(-2)-1| wait s= -q-r= -(-2)-1=2-1=1, | -2| + |1| + |1| =2+1+1=4, dist 2.

( -1,-1): |-1|+|-1|+|2|=1+1+2=4, dist 2.

(0,1): |0|+|1|+|-1|=0+1+1=2, dist 1.

So full list:

- (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2) — q=2, r=0,-1,-2

For q=2: r such that |2| + |r| + | -2-r| =4.

As before, |r| + |2+r| =2.

Earlier I had for q=2, |r| + |2+r| =2, and I found r=0 and r= -2, but for r= -1: | -1| + |2-1| =1 + |1| =1+1=2, yes! I missed r= -1.

Similarly for others.

So for q=2: r=0, -1, -2? r=0: |0| + |2+0| =0+2=2

r= -1: | -1| + |2-1| =1+1=2

r= -2: | -2| + |2-2| =2+0=2

r=1: |1| + |3| =1+3=4>2

r=2: |2| + |4| =2+4=6>2

So (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

Similarly for q=1: |1| + |r| + | -1-r| =1 + |r| + |1+r| =4, so |r| + |1+r| =3

r=1: |1| + |2| =1+2=3

r= -2: | -2| + |1-2| =2+1=3

r=0: |0| + |1| =0+1=1<3

r= -1: | -1| + |0| =1+0=1<3

r=2: |2| + |3| =2+3=5>3

So (1,1), (1,-2)

For q=0: |0| + |r| + | -r| =2|r| =4, so |r|=2, r=2 or -2: (0,2), (0,-2)

For q= -1: | -1| + |r| + |1-r| =1 + |r| + |1-r| =4, so |r| + |1-r| =3

Same as q=1, r=1 or r= -2: (-1,1), (-1,-2)

For q= -2: | -2| + |r| + |2-r| =2 + |r| + |2-r| =4, so |r| + |2-r| =2

r=0: |0| + |2| =0+2=2

r= -1: | -1| + |3| =1+3=4>2? |2-(-1)|=|3|=3, |r|=1, sum 1+3=4>2

r=1: |1| + |1| =1+1=2

r=2: |2| + |0| =2+0=2

r= -2: | -2| + |4| =2+4=6>2

So r=0,1,2: (-2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2)

Now list all 12 cells:

- q=2: (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2)

- q=1: (1,1), (1,-2)

- q=0: (0,2), (0,-2)

- q= -1: (-1,1), (-1,-2)

- q= -2: (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0)

But (-2,0) is listed, and we have 3 for q=2, 2 for q=1, 2 for q=0, 2 for q=-1, 3 for q=-2, total 3+2+2+2+3=12, good.

Now back to spiral.

Last cell of ring 1 is 7 at (1,-1)

Last move was from 6 at (0,-1) to 7 at (1,-1), direction E (dq=1,dr=0)

So start ring 2 by moving in same direction E to (2,-1), place cell 8.

Then turn left 60 degrees ccw to NE direction (0,1)

Move NE to (2,0), place cell 9.

Now, this is the first cell of the first side. Since each side has 2 cells, and we have only one so far, we need to add another cell in the same direction.

From (2,0), move NE to (2,1)? But (2,1) is not in the list; for q=2,r=1, s= -3, |2|+|1|+|-3|=6, dist 3, not in ring 2.

The NE direction from (2,0) is to (2,1), but it's not adjacent in terms of ring; it's outside.

From (2,0), the cell in NE direction that is at dist 2 is not directly; the adjacent cells at dist 2 are (2,-1) already occupied, (1,1), (3,-1)? (3,-1) is dist |3|+|-1|+|-2|=3+1+2=6, dist 3.

The only unoccupied dist 2 cells are others.

From (2,0), neighbors at dist 2 are not directly adjacent; adjacent cells are at dist 1 or 2, but dist from center.

From (2,0), adjacent cells are: (3,0) dist 3, (2,1) dist 3, (1,1) dist 2, (1,0) dist 1 occupied, (2,-1) dist 2 occupied, (3,-1) dist 3.

So only unoccupied adjacent cell is (1,1), which is at dist 2.

And it is in the NW direction from (2,0)? From (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, so vector (-1,1), which is NW direction.

So after placing cell 9 at (2,0), the only unoccupied neighbor is (1,1), which is NW.

In spiral, after placing a cell, if the cell to the "left" is free, you turn left, else continue straight, but here "left" might be defined.

Typically, you continue in the same direction if possible, but here the cell in NE direction (2,1) is at dist 3, not yet part of the ring, so you cannot go there; you must turn.

So turn left to NW, move to (1,1), place cell 10.

Then from there, continue in NW direction to (0,2), place cell 11.

Then turn left to W, move to (-1,2), place cell 12.

Continue W to (-2,2), place cell 13.

Turn left to SW, move to (-2,1), place cell 14.

Continue SW to (-2,0), place cell 15.

Turn left to SE, move to (-1,-1), place cell 16.

Continue SE to (0,-2), place cell 17.

Turn left to E, move to (1,-2), place cell 18.

Continue E to (2,-2), place cell 19.

Now all 12 cells: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(1,1), 11:(0,2), 12:(-1,2), 13:(-2,2), 14:(-2,1), 15:(-2,0), 16:(-1,-1), 17:(0,-2), 18:(1,-2), 19:(2,-2)

In the diagram, we have cell 9 at (2,0), cell 10 at (1,1)? In top row, if (1,1) is at r=1,q=1, and in diagram, after 3 at (0,1), next is 10 at (1,1), yes, matches "3 10".

Cell 14 at (-2,1), in diagram top row q=-2:14, yes.

Cell 15 at (-2,0), in center row q=-2:15, yes.

Cell 16 at (-1,-1), not shown, but probably there.

Cell 17 at (0,-2), not shown.

Cell 18 at (1,-2), not shown.

Cell 19 at (2,-2), not shown.

In the bottom row shown, we have 16 at (-2,-1)? Earlier I had at r=-1,q=-2:16, but in this list, cell 16 is at (-1,-1), cell 19 at (2,-2), so the cell at (-2,-1) is not yet filled; it should be in ring 3.

In diagram, bottom row has q=-2:16, but according to this, cell 16 is at (-1,-1), so inconsistency.

In the diagram, for r=-1, we have cells: from left: 16, then 6,7,8.

Cell 6 is at (0,-1), ring 1.

Cell 7 at (1,-1), ring 1.

Cell 8 at (2,-1), ring 2.

So at q=-2,r=-1: cell 16? But in our list, cell 16 is at (-1,-1), not (-2,-1).

And cell at (-2,-1) is not in ring 2; it would be in ring 3 since dist | -2| + | -1| + |3| =2+1+3=6, dist 3.

But in diagram, it's labeled 16, which is in ring 2, so must be at dist 2.

So our assignment is wrong for that cell.

Cell at (-2,-1): dist | -2| + | -1| + | -(-2)-(-1)| s= -q-r = -(-2) - (-1) =2+1=3, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=3, sum 2+1+3=6, dist 3, so not in ring 2.

But in diagram, it's shown as 16, and 16 is between 15 and 17, which are cells 15 and 17 in ring 2, so likely it is in ring 2.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Perhaps for the bottom row, r= -1, and cell at q= -2 is 16, but in our list, we have cell at ( -2,0) is 15, ( -2,1) is 14, ( -2,2) is 13, but for r= -1, we have cells at ( -2,-1) which is dist 3, not yet filled.

But in the diagram, the cell at q= -2, r= -1 is labeled 16, so it must be filled, and 16 is in ring 2, so dist 2, so our dist calculation must be wrong.

Distance in hexagonal grid: in axial coordinates, the distance between (0,0) and (q,r) is ( |q| + |r| + |q+r| ) / 2? No.

s = -q - r, but the distance is max( |q|, |r|, |s| ) , or ( |q| + |r| + |s| ) / 2? Let's check for adjacent cell.

From (0,0) to (1,0): |1|, |0|, | -1| =1,0,1, max is 1, or sum 2, half is 1, good.

To (1,1): |1|,|1|,| -2| =1,1,2, max 2, dist 2, sum 4, half 2, good.

To (2,0): |2|,|0|,| -2| =2,0,2, max 2, dist 2.

To (2,1): |2|,|1|,| -3| =2,1,3, max 3, dist 3.

To (-2,-1): | -2|,| -1|,|3| =2,1,3, max 3, dist 3.

But for cell at (-2,-1), if it's cell 16 in ring 2, dist should be 2, but it's 3, so perhaps the coordinate is different.

Perhaps the grid is oriented differently, or perhaps I have the axial coordinates wrong.

Another common system is to use cube coordinates, but axial should be fine.

Perhaps "below" is decreasing r, but in the bottom row, r is -1, but cell at (-2,-1) may not be in the same ring.

In the diagram, cell 16 is at the left of the bottom row, and cell 6 is at (0,-1), so likely cell at q= -2, r= -1 is 16.

But according to dist, it's 3, while cell 6 at (0,-1) is dist 1, cell 8 at (2,-1) is dist 2, so cell at (-2,-1) should be dist 2 only if | -2| + | -1| + |3| /2 =6/2=3, dist 3.

Unless the center is not at (0,0), but it is.

Perhaps for cell at (-2,-1), s = -(-2) - (-1) =2+1=3, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=3, sum 6, dist 3.

But in ring 2, dist 2, so it can't be.

Perhaps the cell is at ( -2,0) or something, but in diagram, at r= -1.

Let's look at cell 6: in diagram, in bottom row, between 16 and 7, so likely at q= -1 or q=0.

Assume that in bottom row r= -1, cells at q= -2:16, q= -1: ? , q=0:6, q=1:7, q=2:8.

So cell 6 at (0,-1), cell 7 at (1,-1), cell 8 at (2,-1), cell 16 at (-2,-1).

But cell 16 should be in ring 2, dist 2, but (-2,-1) has dist 3, as above.

Unless the dist formula is different.

Perhaps in this grid, the distance is |q| + |r|, but then for (1,0) dist 1, good, (2,0) dist 2, good, but for (1,1) dist 2, good, but for (0,1) dist 1, good, but for (-2,-1) | -2| + | -1| =3, dist 3, still not 2.

Perhaps it's chessboard distance, but not.

Another idea: perhaps the "r" coordinate is not the same; in some systems, the rows are staggered, but in axial, it should be correct.

Perhaps for the bottom row, the cell at q= -2, r= -1 is not cell 16; in the diagram, it's "16" at the left, then "6", so if 6 is at (0,-1), then the cell to its left at q= -1, r= -1 should be there, but in the list "16,6,7,8", so likely cell at q= -2:16, q=0:6, so no cell at q= -1, r= -1? But that can't be.

Perhaps the cells are not all present; but in a grid, all are present.

Perhaps in the spiral, not all cells are filled at once, but the grid is fully filled as the spiral progresses.

For cell at (-2,-1), it is filled later in ring 3.

But in the diagram, it's shown as 16, and 16 is in the list, so must be filled in ring 2.

Perhaps our ring 2 list is missing some cells.

Earlier I listed 12 cells, but for q= -2, I have ( -2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2), but not (-2,-1).

And for r= -1, I have (2,-1), (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-2), but not (-2,-1) or ( -1,-1) etc.

In the list, I have (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-2), and ( -1,-1), etc.

Cell at (-2,-1) is not in the list; it should be if dist 2, but it's dist 3.

Perhaps for ring 2, it includes cells at dist 2, but (-2,-1) is not among them; only the 12 I listed.

But in the diagram, cell at (-2,-1) is labeled 16, so it must be cell 16, but in our list, cell 16 is at (-1,-1), so perhaps in the diagram, the cell at q= -2, r= -1 is not 16; perhaps it is cell 16, but at a different location.

Let's list the cells from the diagram with numbers:

From top row r=1: q= -2: cell 14, q= -1: cell 4, q=0: cell 3, q=1: cell 10

From center row r=0: q= -2: cell 15, q= -1: cell 5, q=0: cell 1, q=1: cell 2, q=2: cell 9

From bottom row r= -1: q= -2: cell 16, q=0: cell 6, q=1: cell 7, q=2: cell 8

So at r= -1, q= -1 is missing; probably there is a cell at q= -1, r= -1, but not shown, or perhaps it is cell 11 or something.

Cell at ( -1, -1) is not listed, but in our spiral, it should be cell 16 or 17.

In our earlier spiral path for ring 2, we have cell 16 at (-1,-1), which is not in the diagram, but in the bottom row, at q= -1, r= -1, it should be there, but in the diagram, between 16 at q= -2 and 6 at q=0, there should be a cell at q= -1, r= -1.

In the diagram, it's shown as "16 6 7 8", with no cell between 16 and 6, so perhaps there is no cell at q= -1, r= -1, or it is not labeled, but likely it is cell 17 or 18.

Perhaps for r= -1, the cells are only at even q or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the grid is offset; in some hexagonal grids, for odd r, q is integer, for even r, q half-integer, but here all are integer.

Perhaps in this spiral, the cell at ( -1, -1) is filled later.

But in the diagram, for bottom row, it has four cells: 16,6,7,8, so likely at q= -2, -1, 0,1,2? But only four cells, so perhaps q= -2,0,1,2, missing q= -1.

But cell 6 is at q=0, so if no cell at q= -1, then 16 at q= -2, then next is 6 at q=0, so not adjacent, which is impossible in a grid.

So must have cell at q= -1, r= -1.

Probably in the diagram, it is not labeled, but it is cell 11 or 12.

From the numbers, cell 11 should be somewhere.

In our earlier spiral path, after cell 10 at (1,1), cell 11 at (0,2), etc., so not in bottom row.

For the bottom row, cell at ( -1, -1) might be cell 17 or 16.

Let's assume that in the diagram, the cell at q= -1, r= -1 is cell 16, but in the list "16,6,7,8", and 6 is at (0,-1), so if 16 is at (-1,-1), then it should be between, but in the string it's "16 6", so perhaps it is at q= -1, and 6 at q=0, so "16" at q= -1, "6" at q=0, but then what is at q= -2? The diagram has "16" at the left, so likely q= -2 is 16, then q= -1 is next, but not labeled, then q=0:6, etc.

In the diagram, it's " ... 16 6 7 8 ... " with dots, but probably the cells are consecutive, so cell at position 1:16, position 2:6, position 3:7, position 4:8, so if r= -1, and q increasing, then q1:16, q2:6, but then q1 and q2 are adjacent only if |dq|=1, but in hex grid, for same r, cells at q and q+1 are adjacent, so yes, cell at q and q+1 are adjacent horizontally.

So if cell at q=a r= -1:16, q=a+1 r= -1:6, q=a+2 r= -1:7, q=a+3 r= -1:8.

But cell 6 is at (0,-1), as we know, so a+1 = 0, so a = -1, so cell at q= -1 r= -1:16, q=0 r= -1:6, q=1 r= -1:7, q=2 r= -1:8.

So cell 16 is at (-1,-1).

Similarly, in top row, "14 4 3 10", so likely q=b r=1:14, q=b+1 r=1:4, q=b+2 r=1:3, q=b+3 r=1:10.

Cell 4 is at (-1,1), cell 3 at (0,1), so b+1 = -1, b+2 = 0, so b = -2, so cell at q= -2 r=1:14, q= -1 r=1:4, q=0 r=1:3, q=1 r=1:10.

Cell 10 at (1,1).

In center row, "15 5 1 2 9", so q=c r=0:15, q=c+1:5, q=c+2:1, q=c+3:2, q=c+4:9.

Cell 5 at (-1,0), cell 1 at (0,0), cell 2 at (1,0), cell 9 at (2,0), so c+1 = -1, c+2=0, c+3=1, c+4=2, so c= -2, so cell at q= -2 r=0:15, q= -1 r=0:5, q=0 r=0:1, q=1 r=0:2, q=2 r=0:9.

Now all make sense.

So summary of positions:

- (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2

- (0,1): 3

- (-1,1): 4

- (-1,0): 5

- (0,-1): 6

- (1,-1): 7

- (2,-1): 8

- (2,0): 9

- (1,1): 10

- (0,2): 11 (not shown)

- (-1,2): 12 (not shown)

- (-2,2): 13 (not shown)

- (-2,1): 14

- (-2,0): 15

- (-1,-1): 16

- (0,-2): 17 (not shown)

- (1,-2): 18 (not shown)

- (2,-2): 19 ( not shown)

And so on.

Now the spiral order is as we had: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,...

With the path as described.

Now I need to find the position of 2026, then its six neighbors, then their numbers, sum them.

First, find which ring it is in.

The rings are: ring 0: cell 1, number 1.

Ring 1: cells 2 to 7, 6 cells.

Ring 2: cells 8 to 19, 12 cells.

Ring 3: cells 20 to 37, since 6*3=18 cells, 19+18=37.

Ring k for k>=1 has 6k cells.

Cumulative cells up to ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6* k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=0: 1

k=1: 1+3*1*2=7

k=2:1+3*2*3=1+18=19

k=3:1+3*3*4=1+36=37

k=4:1+3*4*5=1+60=61

k=5:1+3*5*6=1+90=91

k=6:1+3*6*7=1+126=127

k=7:1+3*7*8=1+168=169

k=8:1+3*8*9=1+216=217

k=9:1+3*9*10=1+270=271

k=10:1+3*10*11=1+330=331

And so on.

2026 is between which? Find k such that 3k(k+1) +1 >= 2026

3k(k+1) >= 2025

k(k+1) >= 675

k≈ sqrt(675)≈26, since 25*26=650<675, 26*27=702>675.

So for k=26, k(k+1)=26*27=702, 3*702=2106, cumulative 1+2106=2107

For k=25, 25*26=650, 3*650=1950, cumulative 1+1950=1951

2026 > 1951, < 2107, so it is in ring k=26? Ring k has cells from cumulative up to ring k-1 +1 to cumulative up to ring k.

Up to ring m is S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

S(m) is the last cell of ring m.

For example, S(0)=1, ring 0 last.

S(1)=7, ring 1 last.

S(2)=19, ring 2 last.

So last cell of ring k is S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

First cell of ring k is S(k-1) + 1

S(k-1) = 1 + 3(k-1)k

So first cell = [1 + 3(k-1)k] + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For ring k, first cell f(k) = 2 + 3k(k-1)

Last cell l(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

For k=26, f(26) = 2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 3*650 = 2+1950=1952

l(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1+2106=2107

2026 is between 1952 and 2107, so in ring 26.

Number of cells in ring 26 is 6*26=156 cells.

The first cell is 1952.

The position in the ring: the index from the start of the ring is p = 2026 - 1951 = 2026 - (S(25)) = S(25) = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1+1950=1951

S(k) is last of ring k, so S(25) = last of ring 25 = 1951

So first of ring 26 is 1952.

So p = 2026 - 1951 = 75? 2026 - 1951 = 75, but since first cell is 1952, p = 2026 - 1951 = 75, but 1951 is last of previous, so cell number minus S(k-1) should give the index starting from 1.

Cell number n, in ring k, with f(k) <= n <= l(k)

Then the index in the ring is i = n - f(k) + 1 = n - [S(k-1) + 1] + 1 = n - S(k-1)

Since f(k) = S(k-1) + 1

So i = n - S(k-1)

For n=2026, k=26, S(k-1)=S(25)=1951

i = 2026 - 1951 = 75

So the 75th cell in ring 26.

Ring k has 6k cells, for k=26, 6*26=156 cells.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

For ring k, each side has k cells.

So for k=26, each side has 26 cells.

The sides are in order: typically starting from the "east" side or something.

The first cell of the ring is at a specific position.

For ring k, the first cell is at (k, 0) or something.

For example, ring 1: first cell 2 at (1,0)

Ring 2: first cell 8 at (2,-1)

Ring 3: first cell should be at (3,-2) or something.

General pattern: for ring k, the first cell is at (k, -k+1) or something.

For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (2,-1)

k=3: first cell 20 at (3,-2)? Let's see.

From the spiral path, after ring 2 ends at (2,-2) cell 19, then for ring 3, start by moving in the last direction, which was E to (2,-2), so last move was from (1,-2) to (2,-2), direction E.

So move E to (3,-2), place cell 20.

Then turn left to NE, move to (3,-1), place cell 21, and so on.

So for ring k, first cell at (k, 1-k) or (k, -k+1)? For k=1: (1,0) = (1, -1+1)? -k+1=0 for k=1.

k=2: (2,-1) = (2, -2+1)? -1, yes.

k=3: (3,-3+1)=(3,-2), yes.

So general: first cell of ring k at (k, 1-k)

Now, the ring has 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are in the directions: starting from the first cell, and moving in the six directions in counterclockwise order.

The directions are: after placing the first cell, it moves in the direction of the last move, which for the start is usually E, but after placing first cell, it turns left and moves in the next direction.

In the examples:

For ring k, start at (k,1-k)

Then move in the next direction, which is NE for k>1, since last move was E to get there.

From previous ring's last cell, which is at (k-1, - (k-1) ) or something, but for simplicity, from the first cell (k,1-k), the spiral turns left (ccw) from the incoming direction.

Incoming direction is E (since came from (k-1,1-k) to (k,1-k), dq=1,dr=0).

So direction E.

Turn left to NE, which is (0,1) vector.

So move to (k +0, 1-k +1) = (k, 2-k)

Then continue in NE direction for the first side.

Each side has k cells, including the first cell? No, in the side, the cells are added in that direction.

For the first side (NE direction), it adds k cells in the NE direction.

From the first cell (k,1-k), after turning, it moves to (k,2-k), which is the second cell of the ring, and first of the side? Typically, the first cell is already placed, then it adds k-1 more cells in the first direction for the first side.

In ring 2: first cell 8 at (2,-1)

Then turn left to NE, move to (2,0), cell 9.

Then for the first side, it has only one more cell? But each side has k=2 cells, so probably the side includes the cells added in that direction, so for first side, cells added while moving NE.

From (2,-1) to (2,0) is one move, but only one cell added in NE direction? But should be 2 cells for k=2.

After cell 9 at (2,0), it should add another cell in NE direction, but (2,1) is dist 3, not in ring, so it turns, as before.

For ring k, in each direction, it adds k cells, but the direction may not be straight if it hits the ring, but for the first few, it is.

For the first side, from the first cell, after turning, it moves in NE direction for k cells? But for k=2, from (2,-1) move NE to (2,0), then to (2,1)? but (2,1) is not in ring 2.

So instead, it moves to the next cell in the direction that is on the ring.

In general, for a side in direction D, it adds k cells, each by moving in direction D from the previous.

But for the NE direction, moving (0,1), so from (q,r) to (q,r+1)

For example, in ring 2, from (2,-1) to (2,0) is one move NE, but then to (2,1) is outside, so for the second cell, it cannot, so it must be that for the first side, it only has one cell, but should have two.

Perhaps the first cell is not part of the side; the side starts after the turn.

In ring 2: cells 8 and 9 are on the first side? 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), and they are both on the "east" or "southeast" side, but in NE direction from each other? From (2,-1) to (2,0) is NE, yes.

Then for the second cell of the side, it is cell 9, and then it turns.

For ring 2, first side has 2 cells: 8 and 9.

Then second side starts with cell 10 at (1,1), etc.

In general, for ring k, the first side (NE side) has k cells, all with the same q=k, and r from 1-k to ?.

For example, k=2, q=2, r= -1 and 0.

r from 1-2 = -1 to -1 + (k-1) = -1 +1=0, so r= -1,0.

General: for first side, cells at (k, r) for r = (1-k) to (1-k) + (k-1) = 0? 1-k + k-1 =0.

r from 1-k to 0.

For k=2, r= -1 to 0.

For k=1, first side: cells at (1,r) for r=1-1=0 to 0, so only (1,0), cell 2, and since k=1, only one cell, good.

For k=3, first side: cells at (3,r) for r=1-3= -2 to 0? r= -2, -1, 0.

Cells: (3,-2), (3,-1), (3,0)

In ring 3, first cell 20 at (3,-2), then move NE to (3,-1), cell 21, then to (3,0), cell 22.

Then turn to next direction.

Yes.

Then after that, turn left to NW direction, vector (-1,1), so move to (2,1), cell 23, then to (1,2), cell 24, then to (0,3)? but for k=3, dist should be 3, (0,3) dist |0|+|3|+|-3|=6, dist 3, good.

So cells for second side: from (3,0) move NW to (2,1), cell 23, then to (1,2), cell 24, then for k=3, should have three cells, so another to (0,3), cell 25.

Then turn to W, move to (-1,3), cell 26, and so on.

General: for each side, it adds k cells in the current direction.

The directions in order: NE, NW, W, SW, SE, E.

For ring k, after first cell at (k,1-k)

Then first side: NE direction, vector (0,1), so cells at (k, r) for r = (1-k) to (1-k) + (k-1) = 0, so r from 1-k to 0, total k cells.

Then after placing the last cell of first side at (k,0), turn left to NW, vector (-1,1)

Move to (k-1,1), place next cell.

Then continue in NW direction for k cells: from (k-1,1) to (k-2,2), (k-3,3), ..., down to (0,k)

For example k=3: from (3,0) move NW to (2,1), then to (1,2), then to (0,3), so cells at (2,1), (1,2), (0,3)

General: for second side, cells at (k - j, j) for j=1 to k? For j=1: (k-1,1), j=2: (k-2,2), ..., j=k: (0,k)

Yes, k cells.

Then after placing at (0,k), turn left to W, vector (-1,0)

Move to (-1,k), place cell.

Then continue W for k cells: to (-2,k), (-3,k), ..., to (-k,k)

Cells at ( -m, k) for m=1 to k, so from (-1,k) to (-k,k)

Then turn left to SW, vector (0,-1)

Move to (-k,k-1)? From (-k,k), move SW: add (0,-1) to (-k,k-1)

Place cell.

Then continue SW for k cells: to (-k,k-2), ..., to (-k, -k + something)

From ( -k, k) to ( -k, k-1), ( -k, k-2), ..., down to ( -k, 1-k)

Since r decreases from k to 1-k, difference k - (1-k) = 2k-1, number of steps k-1? From r=k to r=1-k, step -1, number of cells: r=k, k-1, ..., 1-k, which is k down to 1-k, number of values: k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 +k +1 = 2k, but should be k cells.

Mistake.

For k=3: after W side, last cell at (-3,3)

Then turn to SW, move to (-3,2), cell say 30 or something.

Then to (-3,1), then to (-3,0)? But should be three cells: (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0)

r from 2 to 0, which is 3 cells: r=2,1,0.

General: from (-k,k) move SW to (-k,k-1), then to (-k,k-2), ..., to (-k,0)? But for r from k down to 0, number of cells k+1, too many.

Should be to r=1-k.

For k=3, r from 3 to 1-3= -2, but in the move, from (-3,3) to (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0), (-3,-1), (-3,-2), that's 6 cells, but should be only 3 for the side.

Error.

After placing the last cell of W side at (-k,k), turn left to SW, move to (-k,k-1), then continue to (-k,k-2), ..., but only for k cells in total for the side, including this one.

For the SW side, cells at ( -k, r) for r = k-1 down to k-1 - (k-1) = 0? Not.

From the first cell of the side at (-k,k)? No, after turn, the first cell of the side is at (-k,k-1)? For k=3: after W side ends at (-3,3), turn to SW, move to (-3,2), which is the first cell of SW side.

Then add k-1 more cells: to (-3,1), (-3,0), so cells (-3,2), (-3,1), (-3,0)

r from 2 to 0, which is r = k-1 down to 0, number of cells: from r=k-1 to r=0 inclusive, number is k.

r=k-1, k-2, ..., 0, which is k values: for k=3, r=2,1,0.

General: r from k-1 down to 0, step -1, number of cells: (k-1) - 0 + 1 = k, good.

Then after placing at (-k,0), turn left to SE, vector (1,-1)

Move to (-k+1,-1), place cell.

Then continue SE for k cells: add (1,-1) each time, so from (-k+1,-1) to (-k+2,-2), (-k+3,-3), ..., to (0,-k)

For k=3: from (-3,0) move SE to (-2,-1), then to (-1,-2), then to (0,-3)

Cells: (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0,-3)

General: cells at (-k + j, -j) for j=1 to k? j=1: (-k+1,-1), j=2: (-k+2,-2), ..., j=k: (0,-k)

Yes.

Then after placing at (0,-k), turn left to E, vector (1,0)

Move to (1,-k), place cell.

Then continue E for k cells: to (2,-k), (3,-k), ..., to (k,-k)

Cells at (m, -k) for m=1 to k, so from (1,-k) to (k,-k)

For k=3: (1,-3), (2,-3), (3,-3)

Then the last cell is at (k,-k), which is the start of the next ring or end.

For ring k, last cell at (k,-k)

For example, ring 1: last cell 7 at (1,-1) = (1,-1)

Ring 2: last cell 19 at (2,-2)

Ring 3: last cell 37 at (3,-3), yes.

Now back to our problem, ring 26, cell index i=75 in the ring.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k=26 cells.

The sides are:

1. NE side: cells with q=k=26, r from 1-k=1-26=-25 to 0. So r= -25, -24, ..., 0. Number of cells: from -25 to 0 inclusive, that's 26 cells.

The first cell of the ring is at (26,-25), which is the first of this side.

Cell index 1: (26,-25)

Index 2: (26,-24)

...

Index 26: (26,0)

Then turn to NW, start second side.

First cell of second side: after placing (26,0), turn left to NW, move to (25,1), place cell index 27.

Then cells for NW side: at (25,1), (24,2), (23,3), ..., down to (0,26)

General: cells at (26 - j, j) for j=1 to 26? j=1: (25,1), j=2: (24,2), ..., j=26: (0,26)

Yes, 26 cells.

Index from 27 to 27+25=52? Index 27: (25,1), index 28: (24,2), ..., index 27+25=52: (0,26)? When j=26, (26-26,26)=(0,26), and index = 27 + (j-1) for j=1 to 26, when j=1, index 27, j=2, index 28, ..., j=26, index 27+25=52.

Yes.

Then after (0,26), turn to W, move to (-1,26), place cell index 53.

Then W side: cells at (-1,26), (-2,26), ..., (-26,26)

So q from -1 to -26, r=26.

Cells: (-m,26) for m=1 to 26, so from (-1,26) to (-26,26)

Index: 53: (-1,26), 54: (-2,26), ..., 53+25=78: (-26,26)

j=1 to 26, index 53 + (j-1), j=1:53, j=26:53+25=78.

Then after (-26,26), turn to SW, move to (-26,25), place cell index 79.

Then SW side: cells at (-26,r) for r=25 down to 0? Earlier we said r from k-1=25 down to 0, so r=25,24,...,0.

Cells: (-26,25), (-26,24), ..., (-26,0)

Index: 79: (-26,25), 80: (-26,24), ..., 79+25=104: (-26,0)? r from 25 to 0, number 26 cells: r=25,24,...,0.

Index: for r=25: index 79, r=24:80, ..., r=0:79+25=104.

Yes.

Then after (-26,0), turn to SE, move to (-25,-1), place cell index 105.

Then SE side: cells at (-25,-1), (-24,-2), ..., (0,-26)

General: (-k + j, -j) for j=1 to k, k=26, so (-26 + j, -j) for j=1 to 26.

j=1: (-25,-1), j=2: (-24,-2), ..., j=26: (0,-26)

Index: 105: j=1, 106: j=2, ..., 105+25=130: j=26.

Then after (0,-26), turn to E, move to (1,-26), place cell index 131.

Then E side: cells at (1,-26), (2,-26), ..., (26,-26)

q from 1 to 26, r=-26.

Cells: (m,-26) for m=1 to 26.

Index: 131: (1,-26), 132: (2,-26), ..., 131+25=156: (26,-26)

Now, our cell is index i=75 in the ring.

Check which side it is in.

Sides:

- Side 1 (NE): indices 1 to 26

- Side 2 (NW): 27 to 52

- Side 3 (W): 53 to 78

- Side 4 (SW): 79 to 104

- Side 5 (SE): 105 to 130

- Side 6 (E): 131 to 156

i=75 is between 53 and 78, so in side 3, the W side.

Side 3: indices 53 to 78, 26 cells.

First cell index 53: (-1,26)

Then index 54: (-2,26), ..., up to index 78: (-26,26)

The cells are at (-m, 26) for m=1 to 26.

Index j in the side: from 1 to 26.

Index in ring: for side 3, index starts at 53, so the position in the side is p = i - 52? Since indices 53 to 78, so for index i, p = i - 52

i=53, p=1; i=54,p=2; ... i=78,p=26.

So p = i - 52

For i=75, p=75-52=23

So the 23rd cell in the W side.

The cells are at q = -p, r=26? For p=1: m=1, q=-1, r=26

p=2: q=-2, r=26

...

p=23: q=-23, r=26

General: for p-th cell in W side, q = -p, r=26

Since m=p, q=-m=-p, r=26.

So for p=23, q=-23, r=26

So position (q,r) = (-23, 26)

Now, we need the six neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors are at:

- E: (q+1,r) = (-22,26)

- W: (q-1,r) = (-24,26)

- NE: (q,r+1) = (-23,27)

- NW: (q-1,r+1) = (-24,27)

- SE: (q+1,r-1) = (-22,25)

- SW: (q,r-1) = (-23,25)

In axial coordinates, neighbors are:

- (q+1,r)

- (q-1,r)

- (q,r+1)

- (q,r-1)

- (q+1,r-1)  // SE

- (q-1,r+1)  // NW

Yes, as above.

So for cell at (-23,26), neighbors:

1. E: (-22,26)

2. W: (-24,26)

3. NE: (-23,27)

4. NW: (-24,27)

5. SE: (-22,25)

6. SW: (-23,25)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

Each position corresponds to a cell in the spiral, so we need to find for each neighbor (q,r), the ring it is in and its position.

Note that the neighbors may be in different rings.

First, find the distance from center to determine the ring.

Distance d = (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 with s = -q - r.

For cell (-23,26), s = -(-23) - 26 = 23 - 26 = -3, |q|=23, |r|=26, |s|=3, sum 23+26+3=52, d=26.

Similarly, for neighbors:

1. E: (-22,26), s = -(-22) - 26 = 22 - 26 = -4, |q|=22, |r|=26, |s|=4, sum 22+26+4=52, d=26

2. W: (-24,26), s = -(-24) - 26 = 24 - 26 = -2, |q|=24, |r|=26, |s|=2, sum 24+26+2=52, d=26

3. NE: (-23,27), s = -(-23) - 27 = 23 - 27 = -4, |q|=23, |r|=27, |s|=4, sum 23+27+4=54, d=27

4. NW: (-24,27), s = -(-24) - 27 = 24 - 27 = -3, |q|=24, |r|=27, |s|=3, sum 24+27+3=54, d=27

5. SE: (-22,25), s = -(-22) - 25 = 22 - 25 = -3, |q|=22, |r|=25, |s|=3, sum 22+25+3=50, d=25

6. SW: (-23,25), s = -(-23) - 25 = 23 - 25 = -2, |q|=23, |r|=25, |s|=2, sum 23+25+2=50, d=25

So neighbors are in rings: E and W in ring 26, NE and NW in ring 27, SE and SW in ring 25.

Now, we need to find the number for each neighbor.

First, for E: (-22,26), in ring 26.

Similarly, our cell is in ring 26 at (-23,26)

In ring 26, we have the W side, but E neighbor is also on the same row r=26, q=-22.

In the W side of ring 26, cells at q=-m, r=26 for m=1 to 26.

So for q=-22, r=26, so m=22, since q=-m, so m=22.

Now, in the W side, the cells are indexed by m, from m=1 to 26.

The index in the side: p = m, since for m=1, q=-1, which is the first cell of the side, index 53 in ring.

For m=22, p=22 in the side.

Now, index in ring: for side 3, indices 53 to 78, and p=1 corresponds to index 53, p=2 to 54, ..., p=22 to 53 + 21 = 74? Since p=1: index 53, so index = 52 + p

p=1:52+1=53, p=2:54, ..., p=22:52+22=74

So index i=74 in ring 26.

Now, the first cell of ring 26 is 1952.

So the number is f(k) + i - 1 = 1952 + 74 - 1 = 1952 + 73 = 2025

f(k) is first cell, index i starts from 1, so number n = f(k) + i - 1

For i=1, n=f(k)

So for i=74, n=1952 + 74 - 1 = 1952 + 73 = 2025

But our cell is at i=75, which is 1952 + 75 - 1 = 1952 + 74 = 2026, yes.

Now E neighbor is at i=74, so number 2025.

Now W neighbor: (-24,26), in ring 26, same side.

q=-24, r=26, so m=24 (since q=-m)

p=m=24 in side.

Index in ring: 52 + p = 52 + 24 = 76

So i=76

Number: 1952 + 76 - 1 = 1952 + 75 = 2027

Now, NE neighbor: (-23,27), in ring 27.

Ring k=27.

First, find first cell of ring 27.

f(k) = 2 + 3k(k-1) for ring k.

Earlier f(k) = S(k-1) + 1

S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

S(26) = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1+2106=2107

So first cell of ring 27 is 2108.

Now, cell at (-23,27)

In ring 27, distance d=27.

The sides: similar.

First, which side is it on?

Ring 27: first cell at (27,1-27)=(27,-26)

Then NE side: cells at (27,r) for r= -26 to 0? r from 1-k=1-27=-26 to 0.

So q=27, r from -26 to 0.

Our cell is at q=-23, r=27, not on this side.

Then NW side: cells at (27 - j, j) for j=1 to 27? From (26,1)? After NE side ends at (27,0), turn to NW, move to (26,1), then to (25,2), ..., to (0,27)

So cells at (27-j, j) for j=1 to 27.

j=1: (26,1), j=2: (25,2), ..., j=27: (0,27)

Our cell (-23,27) is at r=27, q=-23.

In this list, when j=27, (0,27), j=26: (1,26), j=25: (2,25), ..., not (-23,27).

The last cell is (0,27), but we need q=-23.

After NW side, turn to W side: cells at (-m,27) for m=1 to 27? From (0,27) turn to W, move to (-1,27), then to (-2,27), ..., to (-27,27)

So cells at (-m,27) for m=1 to 27.

m=1: (-1,27), m=2: (-2,27), ..., m=27: (-27,27)

Our cell is at (-23,27), so m=23.

So in W side, which is side 3, same as before.

Index in the side: p = m =23

Now, the side starts after NW side.

First, NE side: indices 1 to 27: (27,r) r=-26 to 0.

Number 27 cells.

Then NW side: indices 28 to 54? Since each side has 27 cells.

NE side: i=1 to 27

NW side: i=28 to 54? 27+27=54, but indices from 28 to 54 inclusive is 27 cells? 54-28+1=27, yes.

Then W side: i=55 to 81? 54+27=81, i=55 to 81.

For W side, p-th cell: since first cell i=55: m=1, q=-1,r=27

So for m=p, q=-p, r=27

Index i = 54 + p? i=55 for p=1, so i=54 + p

p=1:55, p=2:56, ..., p=27:54+27=81, yes.

Now our cell m=23, so p=23

i=54 + 23 = 77

So index in ring i=77

First cell is 2108

So number n = f(k) + i - 1 = 2108 + 77 - 1 = 2108 + 76 = 2184

Now NW neighbor: (-24,27), same ring 27.

q=-24,r=27

In W side, m=24

p=24

i=54 + 24 = 78

n=2108 + 78 - 1 = 2108 + 77 = 2185

Now SE neighbor: (-22,25), in ring 25.

Ring k=25.

First cell f(25) = S(24) + 1

S(24) = 1 + 3*24*25 = 1 + 3*600 = 1+1800=1801

So f(25) = 1802

Now cell at (-22,25)

In ring 25, distance 25.

Sides: similar.

Which side? q=-22,r=25

After NE and NW sides.

NE side: q=25, r from 1-25=-24 to 0.

NW side: cells at (25-j,j) for j=1 to 25: j=1:(24,1), j=2:(23,2), ..., j=25:(0,25)

W side: cells at (-m,25) for m=1 to 25: m=1:(-1,25), m=2:(-2,25), ..., m=25:(-25,25)

Our cell (-22,25), so m=22.

In W side, side 3.

Index in ring: W side starts after NW side.

NE side: i=1 to 25

NW side: i=26 to 50? 25+25=50, i=26 to 50.

W side: i=51 to 75? 50+25=75, i=51 to 75.

First cell of W side: i=51: m=1, (-1,25)

So for m=p, q=-p, r=25

p=m=22

Index i=50 + p? i=51 for p=1, so i=50 + p

p=1:51, p=2:52, ..., p=25:50+25=75

So for p=22, i=50+22=72

Number n=1802 + 72 - 1 = 1802 + 71 = 1873

Now SW neighbor: (-23,25), same ring 25.

q=-23,r=25

m=23

p=23

i=50 + 23 = 73

n=1802 + 73 - 1 = 1802 + 72 = 1874

Now summarize the neighbors and their numbers:

- E: (-22,26) : 2025

- W: (-24,26) : 2027

- NE: (-23,27) : 2184

- NW: (-24,27) : 2185

- SE: (-22,25) : 1873

- SW: (-23,25) : 1874

Now sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 + 1873 + 1874

Compute step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

1873 + 1874 = 3747

Now sum: 4052 + 4369 = 8421

8421 + 3747 = 12168

Add: 8421 + 3700 = 12121, plus 47 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

But let me double-check the calculations.

First, E neighbor: same ring, i=74, n=1952 + 74 - 1 = 1952 + 73 = 2025, correct.

W neighbor: i=76, n=1952 + 76 - 1 = 1952 + 75 = 2027, correct.

NE: ring 27, i=77, f=2108, n=2108 + 77 - 1 = 2108 + 76 = 2184, correct.

NW: i=78, n=2108 + 78 - 1 = 2108 + 77 = 2185, correct.

SE: ring 25, i=72, f=1802, n=1802 + 72 - 1 = 1802 + 71 = 1873, correct.

SW: i=73, n=1802 + 73 - 1 = 1802 + 72 = 1874, correct.

Sum: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

1873 + 1874 = 3747

Now 4052 + 4369 = 4050 + 4369 = 8419, plus 2 = 8421? 4052 + 4369.

4000+4300=8300, 52+69=121, total 8300+121=8421, yes.

Then 8421 + 3747.

8421 + 3700 = 12121, plus 47 = 12168, yes.

So the sum is 12168.

But the problem asks for the sum of the six neighbors, and we have them all.

Now, just to be sure, for the SE and SW neighbors, they are in ring 25, which is earlier, so numbers are smaller, which makes sense.

And NE and NW in ring 27, larger numbers.

Also, E and W are adjacent in the same ring, differing by 2, which is consistent since they are consecutive in the side.

In the W side, cells are at q=-24,-23,-22,... for r=26, and numbers: for q=-24:2027, q=-23:2026 (our cell), q=-22:2025, so neighbors are 2025 and 2027, correct.

Others are in different rings.

So I think correct.

Thus the sum is 12168.

The number 2026 is located at position (-23, 26) in the hexagonal grid, within ring 26. The six neighbors of this cell and their corresponding numbers are as follows:

- East neighbor (-22, 26): 2025
- West neighbor (-24, 26): 2027
- Northeast neighbor (-23, 27): 2184
- Northwest neighbor (-24, 27): 2185
- Southeast neighbor (-22, 25): 1873
- Southwest neighbor (-23, 25): 1874

The sum of these neighbors is calculated as follows:

- 2025 + 2027 = 4052
- 2184 + 2185 = 4369
- 1873 + 1874 = 3747
- 4052 + 4369 = 8421
- 8421 + 3747 = 12168

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

\boxed{12168}
