The problem involves natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the snippet provided:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc. But in a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. Looking at the center, which is 1, its neighbors should be the six numbers around it. From the diagram, around 1, I see 2,3,4,5,6, but 7,8,9,10 are a bit farther. Let me sketch this out.

Assume that 1 is at the center. Then, directly above it might be 2? But in the diagram, above 1 is 2? Looking:

The second line is "15 5 1 2 9", so from left to right: 15, 5, 1, 2, 9. And above it: "14 4 3 10", so 14,4,3,10. Below: "16 6 7 8".

So, relative to 1, to the right is 2, above-right is 3? Let me try to arrange them.

In hexagonal grids, there are different coordinate systems, but perhaps I can assign coordinates.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the numbers are arranged in rings. The center is ring 0, containing just 1. Then ring 1 contains numbers 2 through 7? Let's see.

From the diagram: after 1, we have 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc.

But in ring 1, how many cells? In a hexagonal grid, each ring has more cells. The number of cells in ring k is 6k for k>=1, since each ring adds a layer.

Ring 0: 1 cell (1)

Ring 1: 6 cells (2,3,4,5,6,7)

But in the diagram, after 1, we have 2,3,4,5,6,7, but then 8,9,10, etc. But 8 is next to 7, and 7 is next to 1? From the diagram: below 1 is 6? Second line has 15,5,1,2,9. Third line has 16,6,7,8.

So, below 1 is probably 6? Since 6 is below 1 in the third line. Then left of 1 is 5? Since 5 is to the left. Right is 2. Above-right might be 3? But in first line, above is 14,4,3,10. So above 1 is probably 3? But 3 is above, and 4 is left of 3? This is confusing.

Let me list the neighbors of 1. From the diagram, 1 is surrounded by what? Directly adjacent cells.

Looking at positions: assume a hexagonal grid with flat top or pointy top? The diagram shows three rows, with the middle row having five numbers, top and bottom have four, so likely it's oriented with flat top, so each row is offset.

In flat-top hexagonal grid, each row has alternating number of cells, but here top row has four cells: 14,4,3,10

Middle row has five: 15,5,1,2,9

Bottom row has four: 16,6,7,8

So, relative to center (1), the neighbors should be: above: since top row has cells above, but top row has 14,4,3,10, and middle has 15,5,1,2,9. So above 1 might be 3? Because 3 is directly above 1 if we assume columns.

Let me imagine the grid. Suppose we have columns. Let's say column x, row y.

Assume that the cell with 1 is at (0,0).

Then, to the right is 2, so (1,0) is 2.

Above-right might be 3? But in top row, 3 is there, and if top row is row 1, then (0,1) or something.

In flat-top hex grid, moving up-right might be different.

From the diagram, the cell to the right of 1 is 2.

The cell above and slightly left might be 3? But in the sequence, after 1 is 2, then probably 3, but 3 is not adjacent to 1? Let's see the sequence.

Perhaps the spiral starts at 1, then moves in a direction. Typically in spirals, it starts at center and moves out.

Let me try to reconstruct the spiral path.

Start at 1.

Then, probably moves to the right to 2.

Then, since it's hexagonal, it might turn 60 degrees. From 2, where does it go? In the diagram, to the right of 2 is 9? But 9 is far, so probably not. Adjacent to 2 should be 1,3, and others.

From the diagram, above 2 is 3? In top row, 3 is left of 10, and middle row has 2, so if 3 is above 2, that might make sense.

Assume that from 1, it moves right to 2. Then from 2, it moves up-right to 3. Then from 3, it moves up-left to 4? But in top row, left of 3 is 4, and then 14.

But 4 is also adjacent to 1? In the diagram, 4 is above 1? Let's see: if 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then 3 at (1,1) or (0.5,1), but in axial coordinates.

I recall that for hexagonal grids, we can use axial coordinates or cube coordinates.

To simplify, I can find the ring in which 2026 is located, and its position in the ring, and then find its neighbors.

In a hexagonal spiral, the numbers are arranged in concentric hexagons. The center is 1. Then the first ring (ring 1) has 6 cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7. Ring 2 has 12 cells? No, each ring adds 6 cells more than the previous? Let's calculate the total number up to ring k.

Ring 0: 1 cell

Ring 1: 6 cells

Ring 2: 12 cells? But 6+12=18, but from diagram, after 7 should be ring 2.

From diagram, after 1, we have 2 to 7 for ring 1? But in the diagram, after 1 is 2, then 3,4,5,6,7, then 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, etc. But 8 is next to 7, and 7 is at corner, so ring 2 should start after 7.

Typically, the number of cells in ring k is 6k for k≥1. Ring 1: 6*1 =6 cells, ring 2:6*2=12 cells, ring 3:18 cells, and so on.

Total cells up to ring k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Sum from i=1 to k of 6i = 6* k(k+1)/2 = 3k(k+1), plus the center 1, so total S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

S(k) is the last number of ring k.

For example, ring 0: k=0, S(0)=1

Ring 1: k=1, S(1)=1+3*1*2=1+6=7, so numbers 1 to 7.

In diagram, after 7 is 8, which should be start of ring 2.

Ring 2: k=2, S(2)=1+3*2*3=1+18=19, so numbers 1 to 19.

In diagram, we have up to 16, and next should be 17,18,19, etc.

Now, in ring k, there are 6k cells.

The starting number of ring k is S(k-1) + 1, where S(k-1) is the last number of ring k-1.

S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

So first number of ring k is S(k-1) + 1 = [1 + 3(k-1)k] + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=1, first number is 2.

k=2, first number is 2 + 3*2*1 = 2+6=8, yes.

k=3, first number 2 + 3*3*2=2+18=20.

Now, each ring is divided into 6 sides, each side has k cells. Since total cells 6k, and 6 sides, each side has k cells.

The sides are oriented in certain directions.

Now, I need to find where 2026 is.

First, find which ring it is in.

Solve S(k) >= 2026, where S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

So 1 + 3k(k+1) >= 2026

3k(k+1) >= 2025

k(k+1) >= 675

Solve k^2 + k - 675 =0

k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let me see, 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.96

So k ≈ [-1 + 51.96]/2 ≈ 50.96/2 ≈ 25.48

So k=25 or 26?

S(k) =1+3k(k+1)

For k=25, S(25)=1+3*25*26=1+3*650=1+1950=1951

1951 < 2026, so not yet.

k=26, S(26)=1+3*26*27=1+3*702=1+2106=2107

2107 >=2026, so ring k=26.

First number of ring 26 is S(25)+1=1951+1=1952

Last number is S(26)=2107

So 2026 is in ring 26.

The ring has 6*26=156 cells.

The position in the ring: from 1952 to 2107 inclusive.

So the index in the ring: let m = 2026 - 1951 = 2026 - 1951? First number is 1952, so offset from start.

First cell is 1952, last is 2107.

So the sequence number in the ring: p = 2026 - 1951? S(25)=1951 is the last of previous ring, so first of this ring is 1952.

So p = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75? Let's compute.

2026 - 1952 = 74, so it's the 75th cell in the ring (since first is 1st, 1952 is position 1, so 2026 is position 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75.

1952 is pos 1, 1953 pos 2, ..., 2026 is 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75. Yes.

Total cells in ring: 156, so position p=75.

Now, each side has k=26 cells.

Since there are 6 sides, and each side has 26 cells, the total is 156, good.

The sides are traversed in order. Typically, in spirals, it starts at a certain direction and goes around.

Now, where does the ring start? Usually, it starts at the "top-right" or something, but I need to know the direction.

In the initial diagram, for ring 1: cells 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Each side has 1 cell since k=1.

Now, neighbors: for example, cell 2 is adjacent to 1, and to 3,7, etc.

In ring 1, the cells are arranged around center.

Typically, the spiral starts by moving right from center to 2, then turns 60 degrees counterclockwise to go to 3, then to 4, etc.

In the diagram: from 1 to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right), then to 4 (up-left), then to 5 (left), then to 6 (down-left), then to 7 (down-right), back towards center but not.

In ring 1, after 7, it should go to ring 2, starting at 8.

In diagram, after 7 is 8, which is below 7? In bottom row, 6,7,8, so 8 is right of 7.

In ring 2, k=2, each side has 2 cells.

So side 1: say direction right, cells 8,9? But in diagram, after 7 is 8, then probably 9.

But in diagram, middle row has ...1,2,9, so 9 is to the right of 2? So perhaps from 7 to 8 (down-right?), then to 9 (right), but 9 is adjacent to 2.

Perhaps I need to see the path.

From the center 1, moved right to 2.

Then from 2, instead of continuing, it turns left (counterclockwise) to go up-right to 3.

Then from 3 to up-left to 4? But in diagram, 4 is left of 3 in top row.

Then from 4 to left? To 5? But 5 is in middle row left.

In diagram: top row: 14,4,3,10 — so 4 and 3 are adjacent.

Middle:15,5,1,2,9

Bottom:16,6,7,8

So, adjacent pairs: for example, 1 adjacent to 5 (left), 2 (right), and probably 6 (down), 3? But 3 is above, but not directly adjacent? In hex grid, 1 should be adjacent to 6 cells.

Likely neighbors of 1: left:5, right:2, down:6? Since below is 6, up:3? But 3 is above, but in hex grid, if flat top, each cell has neighbors: left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right.

So for 1 at (0,0), neighbors: ( -1,0) left:5, (1,0) right:2, (0,1) up-right? Or down-right? Depending on orientation.

Assume flat top, so for even rows, say.

Set coordinates. Let me define axial coordinates (q,r), with q horizontal, r vertical.

For cell at (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1)? Standard axial coordinates.

In cube coordinates, but axial might be fine.

To avoid confusion, from the diagram, list neighbors of 1.

From positions: 1 is surrounded by: to the left:5, to the right:2, below:6 (since bottom row has 6 below 1? In bottom row, it's 16,6,7,8, and middle has 15,5,1,2,9, so directly below 1 is 6? Assuming same column.

In the grid, columns: let's say column 0: cells? Top row has columns? Perhaps columns are slanted.

Notice that in middle row, columns: let's say index i from left.

Top row: cell 0:14, cell 1:4, cell 2:3, cell 3:10

Middle row: cell 0:15, cell 1:5, cell 2:1, cell 3:2, cell 4:9

Bottom row: cell 0:16, cell 1:6, cell 2:7, cell 3:8

Now, neighbors of 1 (at middle row cell 2):

- Left: cell 1 of middle row: 5

- Right: cell 3 of middle row: 2

- Down-left? Bottom row cell 1:6? Since bottom row is shifted, probably cell 1 of bottom is below cell 1 of middle? But middle cell 1 is 5, bottom cell 1 is 6, so below 5 is 6, but for 1, which is cell 2, below it might be bottom cell 2:7? But 7 is below 1? In the diagram, 1 is above 7? Bottom row has 6,7,8, so if 6 is below 5, 7 below 1, 8 below 2? Seems so, since vertically aligned.

In the text, it's shown as:

...14 4 3 10...

..15 5 1 2 9...

...16 6 7 8...

So visually, 14 is above 15? Not necessarily. In hexagonal grid with flat top, each cell has neighbors in different directions.

Specifically, for cell 1 at position (2,1) say, with row 0 bottom, row 1 middle, row 2 top? Or vice versa.

Assume row y=0 for bottom, y=1 for middle, y=2 for top.

Then bottom row y=0: cells x=0:16, x=1:6, x=2:7, x=3:8

Middle y=1: x=0:15, x=1:5, x=2:1, x=3:2, x=4:9

Top y=2: x=0:14, x=1:4, x=2:3, x=3:10

Now, neighbors of (x,y)=(2,1) i.e., cell 1:

- Same y, x-1: (1,1):5

- Same y, x+1: (3,1):2

- y-1, x: (2,0):7? But (2,0) is 7 in bottom row.

- y-1, x-1: (1,0):6? But (1,0) is 6.

- y+1, x: (2,2):3? Top row x=2 is 3.

- y+1, x+1: (3,2):10? But (3,2) is 10.

But also, in hex grid, there might be another direction. For flat top, neighbors are:

- (q+1, r)

- (q-1, r)

- (q, r+1)

- (q, r-1)

- (q+1, r-1)

- (q-1, r+1)

Depending on the orientation.

In this case, for cell at (q,r), the neighbors are at those offsets.

For (2,1), neighbors:

(3,1), (1,1), (2,2), (2,0), (3,0)? (q+1,r-1)=(3,0), but (3,0) is 8? And (q-1,r+1)=(1,2)

(1,2) is top row x=1:4

(3,0) is bottom row x=3:8

So neighbors of 1 are:

- (1,1):5

- (3,1):2

- (2,2):3

- (2,0):7

- (1,2):4? But (1,2) is 4

- (3,0):8? But (3,0) is 8

But in the diagram, is 4 adjacent to 1? Top row has 4 and 3, and 3 is above 1, 4 is left of 3, so probably 4 is adjacent to 1? In hex grid, yes, since it's diagonally adjacent but in hex grid, all six are adjacent.

Similarly, 8 is adjacent to 1? Bottom row 8 is right of 7, and 7 is below 1, so 8 is down-right of 1.

Now, numbers: neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7? But here we have 2,3,4,5,7,8? 6 is missing, 8 is there.

List: (1,1):5, (3,1):2, (2,2):3, (2,0):7, (1,2):4, (3,0):8

So neighbors are 5,2,3,7,4,8. But earlier I thought 6 should be neighbor, but 6 is at (1,0), which is adjacent to (1,1)=5 and (2,0)=7, but not directly to (2,1)=1.

Distance: from (2,1) to (1,0): delta q= -1, delta r= -1, which is not a neighbor; neighbors are delta q and delta r such that |delta q| <=1, |delta r|<=1, and not both zero, and in hex grid, the sum |delta q| + |delta r| + |delta s| in cube coordinates, but in axial, the distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr|) or something.

Standard axial distance: if we have q and r, with s= -q-r, then distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2, but for neighbors, distance 1.

For cell (q,r), neighbors are (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1), but need to see which combinations.

Commonly, for axial coordinates, the six neighbors are:

- (q+1, r)

- (q-1, r)

- (q, r+1)

- (q, r-1)

- (q+1, r-1)

- (q-1, r+1)

Or sometimes different.

In this case, for (2,1):

- (3,1):2

- (1,1):5

- (2,2):3

- (2,0):7

- (3,0):8? (q+1,r-1)=(3,0)

- (1,2):4? (q-1,r+1)=(1,2)

Yes, so neighbors are (3,1)=2, (1,1)=5, (2,2)=3, (2,0)=7, (3,0)=8, (1,2)=4.

So numbers: 2,5,3,7,8,4.

But earlier I thought it should be 2,3,4,5,6,7, but 6 is not there, instead 8 is there. That can't be right for ring 1.

For ring 1, the cells are 2,3,4,5,6,7, all should be adjacent to 1, but here we have 8, which is in ring 2.

Mistake in coordinate assignment.

In the bottom row, y=0, x=1:6, x=2:7, so 6 and 7 are at (1,0) and (2,0).

But for cell 1 at (2,1), distance to (1,0): delta q= -1, delta r= -1. In axial coordinates, the Manhattan distance is |dq| + |dr| if no diagonal, but in hex, it's different.

The actual distance should be 1 for adjacent cells.

From (2,1) to (1,0): delta q = -1, delta r = -1. In cube coordinates, q + r + s = 0, so s = -q -r. For (2,1), s= -2-1= -3? That can't be; usually s is chosen so that q+r+s=0.

In cube coordinates, each cell has coordinates (q,r,s) with q+r+s=0, and neighbors are (q±1,r,s∓1), etc., but the sum must be zero.

Standard: a cell has (x,y,z) with x+y+z=0, neighbors are the six permutations of (x±1,y,z∓1) with sum change zero.

For example, (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), etc.

But in axial, we use two coordinates, say q and r, with s= -q-r implied.

Then neighbors are (q+1,r, s-1) but s changes, so (q+1,r), (q-1,r), (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), (q-1,r+1), as I had.

But for (2,1), s= -2-1= -3

Neighbor (1,0): s= -1-0= -1, delta q= -1, delta r= -1, delta s=2, not sum zero, and |delta| not 1.

The distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|), and for neighbors, this should be 1.

For (2,1), s= -3

(1,0): s= -1, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, |ds|=2, max is 2, so distance 2, not adjacent.

But in the grid, (2,1) and (1,0) should be adjacent if it's a hex grid.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Perhaps the rows are not aligned.

In flat-top hex grid, the rows are offset.

In this case, for row y, the x-coordinates are offset.

For even y, x even or odd.

In the diagram, bottom row y=0: x=0,1,2,3: 16,6,7,8

Middle y=1: x=0,1,2,3,4: 15,5,1,2,9

Top y=2: x=0,1,2,3: 14,4,3,10

Now, cell at (2,1):1

Cell at (1,0):6

Are they adjacent? Visually, in the text, 6 is below and left of 1? In the middle row, 5 is at (1,1), 1 at (2,1), so 5 is left of 1. Below 5 is 6 at (1,0). So 6 is below-left of 1? But in hex grid, 1 should be adjacent to the cell below it, which is at (2,0):7, and also to (1,1):5, and to (3,1):2, and to (2,2):3, and also to (1,2):4, and to (3,0):8? But (3,0) is 8, which is below-right.

But is 6 adjacent to 1? From (2,1) to (1,0): in hex grid with flat top, the cell at (1,0) is not directly adjacent to (2,1); it is adjacent to (1,1), (2,0), (0,0), etc.

Specifically, for (2,1), neighbors should be:

- (2,0) directly below

- (3,1) directly right

- (2,2) directly above

- (1,1) directly left

- (3,0) below-right? Since for even row, the cells below are at y-1, x and x+1 or something.

Standard for flat-top: for a cell at (x,y), neighbors are:

- (x, y-1) below

- (x, y+1) above

- (x-1, y) left

- (x+1, y) right

- and depending on y parity, for even y, (x-1, y+1) up-left, (x-1, y-1) down-left? I need to recall.

Generally, the neighbors are at (x±1,y), (x,y±1), and (x±1,y±1) but not all.

For flat-top, the six neighbors are:

- (x+1, y)

- (x-1, y)

- (x, y+1)

- (x, y-1)

- (x+1, y-1) if y even, or (x-1, y-1) if y odd? I'm confusing myself.

Let's list the cells around (2,1).

Assume y=1 is the middle row.

Cell (2,1):1

Directly left: (1,1):5

Directly right: (3,1):2

Directly above: in y=2, what x? If same x, (2,2):3

Directly below: in y=0, (2,0):7

Then the diagonal neighbors: up-left: at y=2, x=1 or x=2? (1,2):4

Down-right: at y=0, x=3:8

So neighbors are (1,1):5, (3,1):2, (2,2):3, (2,0):7, (1,2):4, (3,0):8

As before.

But for cell 1, its neighbors should be the cells in ring 1, which are 2,3,4,5,6,7, but here we have 8, which is not in ring 1. 8 is in ring 2, since ring 2 starts at 8.

So this suggests that in this grid, the cell at (3,0):8 is adjacent to 1, but 8 is not a neighbor; it should not be adjacent. So my coordinate assignment is wrong.

Perhaps the grid is pointy-top instead of flat-top.

Let me try pointy-top hex grid.

In pointy-top, each cell has neighbors at 60 degree intervals.

For cell at (x,y), neighbors are (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1) with combinations.

For example, in pointy-top, for a cell, neighbors are:

- (x+1, y) right

- (x-1, y) left

- (x, y+1) down-right

- (x, y-1) up-right

- (x+1, y-1) up-left

- (x-1, y+1) down-left

Or something like that.

Let's try for (2,1):1

Assume rows are pointy-top, so for a given y, x ranges.

In the diagram, for y=1 (middle), cells at x=0,1,2,3,4

For y=0 (bottom), x=0,1,2,3

For y=2 (top), x=0,1,2,3

Now, for (2,1):1

- (3,1):2 (right)

- (1,1):5 (left)

- (2,2):3? But y=2 is top row, (2,2):3, which would be above, but in pointy-top, above might be different.

- (2,0):7 (below)

- (3,2):10? (x+1,y+1) or what.

Perhaps (x+1, y-1) etc.

Let's calculate the distance.

Perhaps from the values, for cell 1, its neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

From the diagram, 2 is right, 5 is left, 6 is below, 3 is above, then 4 and 7 must be the diagonals.

4 is at (1,2), 7 at (2,0), but as before, not adjacent if we use the coordinate system.

Perhaps the rows are not all at the same y; in hex grid, each row is at a different "height", but in this text representation, it's approximate.

Perhaps for the spiral, the neighbors can be determined by the ring and position.

Let's think about the spiral path.

Start at 1.

From 1, move in direction 0 (say east) to 2.

Then turn 60 degrees left (counterclockwise) to direction 300 degrees or something, to go to 3.

From 2 to 3: in the diagram, 3 is above and left of 2? In top row, 3 is above, and 2 is in middle, so if we assume that from 2, moving up-left to 3.

Then from 3 to 4: left to 4.

Then from 4 to 5: down-left to 5, since 5 is in middle left.

Then from 5 to 6: down to 6? But 6 is in bottom, below 5.

Then from 6 to 7: down-right to 7? But 7 is to the right of 6 in bottom row.

Then from 7 to 8: down-right or right to 8.

But for ring 1, after 7, it should go to ring 2.

From 7, it moves to 8, which is in the next ring.

In ring 2, k=2, each side has 2 cells.

The first cell of ring 2 is 8, at the "southeast" corner or something.

From 7, it moves in the same direction as from 6 to 7, which was say southeast, to 8.

Then from 8, it turns left 60 degrees to go east to 9.

In the diagram, 9 is to the right of 2 in middle row, so from 8 to 9, if 8 is at (3,0), 9 at (4,1), but not adjacent.

Perhaps the path is: from 7 at (2,0), move east to 8 at (3,0).

Then from 8, turn left (ccw) to go northeast to 9. In diagram, 9 is at (4,1), which is above and right of 8? (3,0) to (4,1), delta x=1, delta y=1, which in hex grid might be adjacent if pointy-top.

Assume pointy-top hex grid.

In pointy-top, for a cell at (x,y), the neighbors are:

- (x+1, y) : east

- (x-1, y) : west

- (x, y-1) : northwest

- (x, y+1) : southeast

- (x+1, y-1) : northeast

- (x-1, y+1) : southwest

Or something like that. Let's define.

Commonly, for pointy-top, with y vertical, x horizontal, then for cell (x,y), neighbors:

- (x+1, y) : E

- (x-1, y) : W

- (x, y-1) : NE

- (x, y+1) : SW

- (x+1, y-1) : SE? Let's see the offsets.

Typically, the six directions:

Let dr be the row, dc the column.

For pointy-top, the neighbors of (dr,dc) are:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc) : NW

- (dr+1, dc) : SE

- (dr-1, dc+1) : NE

- (dr+1, dc-1) : SW

Yes, that's standard.

In this case, for the grid, let's assign dr and dc.

From the diagram, let's find the coordinates of the cells.

Assume that 1 is at (0,0).

Then 2 is east of 1, so (0,1) if we use (dr,dc), but usually dc is column, dr row.

Set dc as the column index, dr as the row index.

For 1 at (dr,dc) = (0,0)

2 is east, so (0,1)

3 is northeast of 2? In diagram, 3 is above and left or right? In top row, 3 is above 1, and 2 is to the right of 1, so 3 is above and between 1 and 2, so for pointy-top, from 2 at (0,1), 3 might be at (-1,1) or (-1,2).

Assume from 1 to 2: from (0,0) to (0,1) east.

Then from 2 to 3: turn left 60 degrees, which would be to the northwest, so to ( -1,1) if we use the neighbor definitions.

From (0,1), neighbor NW is (dr-1, dc) = (-1,1)

Then from 3 at (-1,1) to 4: turn left again, so from NW, turn left to W, so to ( -1,0)

But in diagram, 4 is left of 3, and 3 is at x=2 in top row, 4 at x=1, so if dc decreases, yes, from dc=1 to dc=0 at same dr.

So 4 at (-1,0)

Then from 4 to 5: turn left to SW, so to (0,0), but (0,0) is 1, already occupied, so instead, since it's the corner, it turns or something.

From 4 at (-1,0), turn left from west to southwest, so to (dr+1, dc-1) = (0,-1)

But in diagram, 5 is at middle row left, which is below and left, so (0,-1) if we assume rows.

Then from 5 to 6: turn left to south or southeast. From SW, turn left to S, which might be (dr+1, dc) = (1,-1)? But let's see.

5 at (0,-1), then to 6, which is below, in bottom row, so if bottom row is dr=1, then from (0,-1) to (1,-1) or (1,-2), etc.

In diagram, 6 is directly below 5, and in bottom row, so if 5 is at dr=0, dc= -1, then below might be (1,-1) or (1,-2).

Assume that for dr, higher dr is lower row, or vice versa.

Set dr increasing downward.

So let dr be row from top, so top row dr=0, middle dr=1, bottom dr=2.

Then 1 at (1,2) say, but earlier I had it at (2,1), but let's start over.

Let me define the grid with dr as row number, 0 at top, increasing down.

dc as column number, 0 at left.

For pointy-top hex grid.

Then for a cell at (dr,dc), neighbors are:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc) : NW

- (dr+1, dc) : SE

- (dr-1, dc+1) : NE

- (dr+1, dc-1) : SW

Now, from the diagram:

Top row dr=0: cells dc=0:14, dc=1:4, dc=2:3, dc=3:10

Middle dr=1: dc=0:15, dc=1:5, dc=2:1, dc=3:2, dc=4:9

Bottom dr=2: dc=0:16, dc=1:6, dc=2:7, dc=3:8

Now, cell 1 at (1,2)

Its neighbors should be:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,2)=(0,2):3

- SE: (1+1,2)=(2,2):7

- NE: (1-1,2+1)=(0,3):10

- SW: (1+1,2-1)=(2,1):6

So neighbors are 2,5,3,7,10,6

Numbers: 2,5,3,7,10,6

But 10 is in ring 2, not ring 1, and 6 is in ring 1, but 10 is not a neighbor of 1; it should not be adjacent.

Distance from 1 to 10: 10 is at (0,3), 1 at (1,2), delta dr= -1, delta dc=1, which is the NE neighbor, so in this grid, they are adjacent, but in the number spiral, 10 is not a neighbor of 1; it's farther away.

So this is not working.

Perhaps the grid is not aligned this way, or the spiral is different.

Another idea: in the hexagonal spiral, the cells are added in rings, and for a cell in ring k, its neighbors are in ring k-1, k, or k+1.

For example, for a cell in ring k, it may have neighbors in the same ring, and in adjacent rings.

For the center 1, neighbors are all in ring 1.

For a cell in ring 1, it may have neighbors in ring 0 (center), ring 1 (adjacent cells), and ring 2 (outer).

But in this case, for cell 2 in ring 1, its neighbors include 1 (ring 0), 3 and 7 (ring 1), and 8 and 9 (ring 2), etc.

From the diagram, for cell 2 at (1,3) in my last coordinate, neighbors:

- E: (1,4):9

- W: (1,2):1

- NW: (0,3):10

- SE: (2,3):8

- NE: (0,4): ? not present, or if exists, but in diagram only up to dc=3 for dr=0, so no

- SW: (2,2):7

So neighbors are 9,1,10,8,7

Numbers: 9,1,10,8,7

But it should also be adjacent to 3, which is at (0,2), but (0,2) is not a neighbor; from (1,3) to (0,2): delta dr= -1, delta dc= -1, which is not one of the neighbor directions; the directions are only the six listed, so not adjacent to (0,2).

But in the grid, 2 and 3 should be adjacent, as they are next in the spiral.

So this is not correct.

Perhaps the coordinate system is flat-top.

Let's try flat-top.

For flat-top hex grid, with dr row, dc column.

Neighbors:

- (dr, dc+1) : NE

- (dr, dc-1) : SW

- (dr-1, dc) : NW

- (dr+1, dc) : SE

- (dr-1, dc+1) : E? This depends on the offset.

Usually, for flat-top, the neighbors depend on whether dr is even or odd.

For example, if dr even, then:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc) : NW

- (dr-1, dc+1) : NE

- (dr+1, dc) : SW

- (dr+1, dc+1) : SE

If dr odd, then:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc-1) : NW

- (dr-1, dc) : NE

- (dr+1, dc-1) : SW

- (dr+1, dc) : SE

Now, in our grid, let's assume dr=0 top, dr=1 middle, dr=2 bottom.

Cell 1 at (1,2)

Assume this is odd dr, since 1 is odd.

Then neighbors:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,1-1)=(0,0):14

- NE: (1-1,1)=(0,1):4

- SW: (1+1,1-1)=(2,0):16? or (2,0):16, but bottom row dc=0 is 16

- SE: (1+1,1)=(2,1):6

So neighbors are 2,5,14,4,16,6

Again, 14 and 16 are in outer rings, not good.

Perhaps dr=1 is even? But 1 is odd number, but dr is row number.

Assume dr=1 is even for this cell.

Then neighbors:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,1)=(0,1):4

- NE: (1-1,2)=(0,2):3

- SW: (1+1,1)=(2,1):6

- SE: (1+1,2)=(2,2):7

So neighbors: 2,5,4,3,6,7

Perfect! All from ring 1: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Yes! So for cell 1 at (1,2), with dr=1 even, neighbors are (1,3):2, (1,1):5, (0,1):4, (0,2):3, (2,1):6, (2,2):7.

All correct.

So the grid is flat-top, and for even rows, the neighbors are as above for even dr.

Specifically, for a cell at (dr,dc), if dr even, neighbors:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc) : NW

- (dr-1, dc+1) : NE

- (dr+1, dc) : SW

- (dr+1, dc+1) : SE

If dr odd, neighbors:

- (dr, dc+1) : E

- (dr, dc-1) : W

- (dr-1, dc-1) : NW

- (dr-1, dc) : NE

- (dr+1, dc-1) : SW

- (dr+1, dc) : SE

Now, in this case, for cell 1 at (1,2), dr=1 is odd? 1 is odd, but in my calculation, I assumed dr=1 even to get the correct neighbors. But dr=1 is odd, so I should use the odd dr formula.

For dr=1 odd:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,1-1)=(0,0):14

- NE: (1-1,1)=(0,1):4

- SW: (1+1,1-1)=(2,0):16

- SE: (1+1,1)=(2,1):6

But this gives 2,5,14,4,16,6, which includes 14 and 16, not good.

But when I used even dr, I got correct. So perhaps the row numbering is such that the center is at an even row.

Perhaps dr=0 for bottom or top.

Set dr=0 for bottom row.

Bottom row dr=0: cells dc=0:16, dc=1:6, dc=2:7, dc=3:8

Middle row dr=1: dc=0:15, dc=1:5, dc=2:1, dc=3:2, dc=4:9

Top row dr=2: dc=0:14, dc=1:4, dc=2:3, dc=3:10

Now, cell 1 at (1,2)

Assume dr=1 is odd (since 1 is odd).

Neighbors for odd dr:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,1-1)=(0,0):16

- NE: (1-1,1)=(0,1):6

- SW: (1+1,1-1)=(2,0):14

- SE: (1+1,1)=(2,1):4

So neighbors: 2,5,16,6,14,4

Again includes 14,16, not good.

If dr=1 even:

- E: (1,3):2

- W: (1,1):5

- NW: (1-1,1)=(0,1):6

- NE: (1-1,2)=(0,2):7

- SW: (1+1,1)=(2,1):4? (2,1) is top row dc=1:4

- SE: (1+1,2)=(2,2):3

So neighbors: 2,5,6,7,4,3 — perfect: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Yes! So when dr=1 is even, it works. So for the center cell, dr must be even in this coordinate system.

So we'll use that. So bottom row dr=0 (even), middle dr=1 (odd? no, in this case dr=0 bottom, dr=1 middle, dr=2 top.

dr=0 (bottom) even, dr=1 (middle) odd, dr=2 (top) even.

Cell 1 at (1,2), dr=1 which is odd, but when we used the even dr formula, it worked, but for dr=1 odd, it didn't. So for this cell, since it's in an odd row, we should use the odd row formula, but it gave wrong neighbors, so perhaps the parity is defined differently, or perhaps for this spiral, the grid is oriented such that the center has a specific parity.

In this case, for cell at (dr,dc) with dr odd, the neighbors are as per odd dr formula, but in the spiral, not all are occupied or something, but for cell 1, it should have six neighbors, all in ring 1.

Perhaps in this coordinate system, for the spiral, the coordinates are assigned differently.

But for our purpose, since we have the ring structure, we can find the position and then determine the neighbors based on the ring and side.

So back to the ring approach.

We have 2026 in ring k=26, position p=75 in the ring.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k=26 cells.

The sides are numbered, say from 0 to 5, each corresponding to a direction.

The first cell of the ring is at a corner, and it starts in a specific direction.

From the initial diagram, for ring 1 (k=1), cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Typically, it starts at the "east" or "northeast" cell.

In our earlier grid, if 1 is at (1,2), then 2 is at (1,3) east, so the first cell of ring 1 is 2 at east.

Then it goes to 3 at northeast, etc.

The directions: let's define the six directions as 0: east, 1: northeast, 2: northwest, 3: west, 4: southwest, 5: southeast, or something.

From 2 to 3: in the grid, from (1,3) to (0,2) or what? In our working grid, with bottom dr=0, middle dr=1, top dr=2.

Cell 2 at (1,3)

Cell 3 at (2,2) in top row? Earlier we have top row dr=2, dc=2:3

From (1,3) to (2,2): delta dr=1, delta dc= -1.

In flat-top hex grid, with dr even or odd.

dr=1 (middle) is odd.

For a cell in odd dr, neighbors include (dr+1, dc-1) which is SW, and (dr-1, dc) NE, etc.

From (1,3) to (2,2): if dr=1 odd, (dr+1, dc-1)=(2,2), which is the SW neighbor.

But in the spiral, from 2 to 3, it should be turning left from east, so if it was moving east to 2, then turns left to NE or NW.

In this case, from 1 to 2: from (1,2) to (1,3), which is east.

Then from 2 to 3: if it turns left (counterclockwise), from east, left would be to northeast.

For odd dr, northeast neighbor is (dr-1, dc) = (0,3) for cell 2 at (1,3), but (0,3) is bottom row dc=3:8, which is not 3.

3 is at (2,2), which is SW.

SW is south-west, which is down-left, which is not left turn from east; left turn from east should be north, not south.

Perhaps it turns right instead.

In some spirals, it turns right (clockwise).

From 1 to 2 east, then from 2 to 3, if turn right, from east to southeast or southwest.

Southeast for odd dr is (dr+1, dc) = (2,3) for cell 2, but (2,3) is top row dc=3:10, not 3.

3 is at (2,2), which is (dr+1, dc-1) = (2,2), which is SW.

SW is 240 degrees, while east is 0, so turning left (ccw) would be to 60 degrees (NE), turning right (cw) to 300 degrees (NW), but SW is 240, which is not a 60 degree turn.

Perhaps the direction is different.

From the path: after 2, it goes to 3, which is above and left, so in the grid, from (1,3) to (2,2), which is up and left, so if east is right, up-left is northwest or northeast.

In our calculation, from (1,3) to (2,2), if dr increases down, then from row 1 to row 2, down, and dc from 3 to 2, left, so down-left, which is southwest if we consider the directions.

But in the spiral, from 2, it should be moving in a direction away from center, but 3 is not necessarily away.

Perhaps for the ring, the cells are added in order around the ring.

For ring 1, cells: 2,3,4,5,6,7 in order.

In the grid, 2 at (1,3), 3 at (2,2), 4 at (2,1), 5 at (1,1), 6 at (0,1), 7 at (0,2) or something.

From earlier, with bottom dr=0: 16,6,7,8 at dc=0,1,2,3

Middle dr=1: 15,5,1,2,9 at dc=0,1,2,3,4

Top dr=2: 14,4,3,10 at dc=0,1,2,3

So cell 2 at (1,3)

Cell 3 at (2,2)  // top row dc=2

Cell 4 at (2,1)  // top row dc=1

Cell 5 at (1,1)  // middle row dc=1

Cell 6 at (0,1)  // bottom row dc=1

Cell 7 at (0,2)  // bottom row dc=2

Then back, but for ring 1, ends at 7, then ring 2 starts at 8 at (0,3) or (1,4), etc.

Now, from 2(1,3) to 3(2,2): delta dr=+1, delta dc= -1

From 3(2,2) to 4(2,1): delta dr=0, delta dc= -1, so west

From 4(2,1) to 5(1,1): delta dr= -1, delta dc=0, so north (since dr decreases up)

From 5(1,1) to 6(0,1): delta dr= -1, delta dc=0, north

From 6(0,1) to 7(0,2): delta dr=0, delta dc= +1, east

So the directions are not consistent; it's not moving in a straight line for each side.

For ring 1, since k=1, each "side" has only one cell, so it turns at each cell.

For higher k, each side has k cells, so it moves straight for k cells in one direction, then turns 60 degrees.

For example, in ring 2, k=2, cells 8 to 19.

From 7 at (0,2), then to 8: in diagram, 8 is at (0,3) or (1,4)? In bottom row, dc=3:8, so (0,3)

From 7(0,2) to 8(0,3): delta dr=0, delta dc=+1, east

Then from 8 to 9: in diagram, 9 is at (1,4) in middle row, so (1,4)

From (0,3) to (1,4): delta dr=+1, delta dc=+1

Then from 9 to 10: 10 at (2,3) top row, so (2,3)

From (1,4) to (2,3): delta dr=+1, delta dc= -1

And so on.

The direction changes.

To find the neighbors of a cell, it's easier to use the ring and position to determine its coordinates or its neighbors' positions.

For a cell in ring k at position p (from 1 to 6k), we can find which side it is on, and its position on the side, and then find the coordinates or the adjacent cells.

The neighbors will be in ring k-1, k, or k+1.

Specifically, for a cell not on a corner, it has two neighbors in the same ring (adjacent in the ring), two in ring k-1 (inner), and two in ring k+1 (outer), but at corners, it may have only one in some rings.

For example, in ring 1, cell 2: neighbors include 1 (center, ring 0), 3 and 7 (same ring), and 8,9 (ring 2), etc.

In general, for a cell in ring k, it has:

- Two adjacent cells in the same ring: the previous and next in the spiral order.

- One or two cells in ring k-1: depending on if it's a corner or not.

- One or two cells in ring k+1: similarly.

Specifically, for a cell on the side but not corner, it has two neighbors in ring k-1, one in ring k+1, and two in same ring.

At a corner, it has one neighbor in ring k-1, one in ring k+1, and two in same ring.

Let's take an example.

Take cell 2 in ring 1: k=1, p=1 (first cell)

Neighbors: 1 (ring 0), 3 (ring 1), 7 (ring 1? 7 is also in ring 1, but is it adjacent? In the grid, is 2 adjacent to 7? In our earlier correct grid, cell 2 at (1,3), cell 7 at (0,2), and with dr=1 odd, but earlier we had issues, but in the correct neighbor list for 1, but for 2.

From the grid we have, cell 2 at (1,3) dr=1 odd.

Using the flat-top neighbor formula for odd dr:

- E: (1,4):9

- W: (1,2):1

- NW: (1-1,3-1)=(0,2):7

- NE: (1-1,3)=(0,3):8

- SW: (1+1,3-1)=(2,2):3

- SE: (1+1,3)=(2,3):10

So neighbors: 9,1,7,8,3,10

Now, 1 is ring 0, 3 and 7 are ring 1, 8,9,10 are ring 2.

So for a corner cell like 2, it has one neighbor in ring k-1=0 (1), two in same ring k=1 (3 and 7), and three in ring k+1=2 (8,9,10)? But 8,9,10 are all adjacent, but in hex grid, it can have up to six neighbors.

In this case, it has six: 1,3,7,8,9,10.

But 7 and 3 are in same ring, 1 in inner, 8,9,10 in outer.

For our purpose, to find the neighbors of 2026, we need to find which numbers are adjacent to it, which may be in different rings.

Since the grid is regular, we can find the coordinates of 2026 and then find its neighbors' coordinates, then find what numbers are there.

So let's define the coordinate system as before, with flat-top hex grid, dr row from bottom to top, so bottom row dr=0, middle dr=1, top dr=2 in the diagram, but for general, dr can be any integer.

And dc column from left to right.

And we need to know for each cell its (dr,dc).

The center cell 1 is at (0,0), and we need to know the parity at (0,0).

In our earlier successful calculation for cell 1, when we placed it at (1,2) with dr=1 even, it worked, but if we want center at (0,0), let's try.

Suppose 1 at (0,0).

Then for it to have neighbors at (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (1,0), (1,1) or something.

From earlier, when it was at (1,2), neighbors were (1,3),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(2,1),(2,2)

So if we shift, let dr' = dr -1, dc' = dc -2, so that 1 is at (0,0).

Then neighbors at (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,0), (1,-1), (1,0)? Let's see:

(1,3) -> (0,1)

(1,1) -> (0,-1)

(0,1) -> (-1,-1)

(0,2) -> (-1,0)

(2,1) -> (1,-1)

(2,2) -> (1,0)

So neighbors at (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,0), (1,-1), (1,0)

Now, at (0,0), what is the parity of dr? dr=0 even.

Neighbors for even dr:

- E: (0,1)

- W: (0,-1)

- NW: (-1,0)  // (dr-1, dc)

- NE: (-1,1)  // (dr-1, dc+1)

- SW: (1,0)  // (dr+1, dc)

- SE: (1,1)  // (dr+1, dc+1)

But in our list, we have (-1,-1), which is not in this list. (-1,-1) is not a neighbor according to this.

But in our list, (-1,-1) is a neighbor, but according to the formula for even dr, it's not included.

For (0,0) even, the neighbors should be (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (1,0), (1,1)

But in our shifted list, we have (-1,-1) and (1,-1), not (-1,1) and (1,1).

So mismatch.

Perhaps the parity is defined differently, or the grid is oriented differently.

Notice that in the list, the neighbors are at vectors: (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,0), (1,-1), (1,0)

Which can be seen as the six directions: E, W, NW, N, SW, S or something.

In terms of delta dr, delta dc:

- (0,1): delta dr=0, delta dc=1

- (0,-1): delta dr=0, delta dc= -1

- (-1,-1): delta dr= -1, delta dc= -1

- (-1,0): delta dr= -1, delta dc=0

- (1,-1): delta dr=1, delta dc= -1

- (1,0): delta dr=1, delta dc=0

So the offsets are: (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,0), (1,-1)

Now, this is symmetric, and for any cell, the neighbors are at these six offsets, regardless of parity. In this grid, the neighbor offsets are constant, not depending on parity.

In this particular spiral, the grid is such that the neighbor offsets are the same for all cells: the six vectors: (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,0), (1,-1)

In other words, for a cell at (dr,dc), neighbors at (dr, dc+1), (dr, dc-1), (dr-1, dc), (dr-1, dc-1), (dr+1, dc), (dr+1, dc-1)

And this is consistent with what we had for cell 1 at (1,2): neighbors at (1,3), (1,1), (0,2), (0,1), (2,2), (2,1) which are 2,5,3,4,7,6 as before.

And for cell 2 at (1,3): neighbors at (1,4), (1,2), (0,3), (0,2), (2,3), (2,2) which are 9,1,8,7,10,3

As in the diagram.

So for this spiral, the grid is flat-top, but with a fixed neighbor set, not depending on parity. The offsets are always the same: + (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,0), (1,-1)

So we can use this coordinate system.

Now, the center 1 is at (0,0), but in our earlier, when we had it at (1,2), but we can define a new coordinate system where 1 is at (0,0).

From cell 1 at (dr,dc) = (1,2) in some system, but to make it (0,0), set q = dr -1, r = dc -2, so 1 at (0,0).

Then neighbors at (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,0), (1,-1) as above.

So in general, for a cell at (q,r), neighbors at (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q-1,r), (q-1,r-1), (q+1,r), (q+1,r-1)

Now, we need to find for number 2026 its (q,r) coordinates.

The spiral starts at (0,0) with 1, then moves to (0,1) for 2, then to (-1,0) for 3? Let's see the path.

From 1 at (0,0)

To 2 at (0,1)  // east

Then to 3 at (-1,0)  // from (0,1) to (-1,0): delta q= -1, delta r= -1, which is northwest

Then to 4 at (-1,-1)  // west, since r decreases

Then to 5 at (0,-1)  // from (-1,-1) to (0,-1): delta q=1, delta r=0, southeast

Then to 6 at (1,-1)  // south or southeast

Then to 7 at (1,0)  // east

Then to 8 at (1,1)  // east from (1,0) to (1,1)

Then to 9 at (0,2)  // from (1,1) to (0,2): delta q= -1, delta r=1, northeast

And so on.

Now, for ring k, it starts at a specific point.

For example, ring 1: cells 2 to 7.

First cell 2 at (0,1)

Last cell 7 at (1,0)

Ring 2: cells 8 to 19.

First cell 8 at (1,1)

Last cell 19 at ? but we have only up to 16 in diagram, but S(2)=19, so 19 is last.

From the path, after 7 at (1,0), to 8 at (1,1), then to 9 at (0,2), then to 10 at (-1,2), then to 11 at (-1,1), then to 12 at (-1,0), but (-1,0) is already occupied by 3, so probably not.

From 9 at (0,2) to 10 at (-1,2)? Then to 11 at (-1,1), then to 12 at (-1,0), but occupied, so must turn.

Typically, after the first cell of the ring, it moves in the direction.

From the initial move: from 7 (end of ring 1) to 8 (start of ring 2) at (1,1)

Then from 8 to 9: to (0,2)

Then from 9 to 10: to (-1,2) or to (0,3)? In diagram, after 9 is 10 at (2,3) in top row, which is (q,r) with q=dr-1, r=dc-2, top row dr=2, dc=3:10, so q=2-1=1, r=3-2=1, so (1,1), but that's 8 or something.

In our coordinate, for cell 10 at (2,3) in earlier, dr=2, dc=3, so q=dr-1=1, r=dc-2=1, so (1,1), but 8 is also at (1,1)? Conflict.

Earlier cell 8 at bottom dr=0, dc=3:8, q=0-1= -1, r=3-2=1, so (-1,1)

Cell 9 at middle dr=1, dc=4:9, q=1-1=0, r=4-2=2, so (0,2)

Cell 10 at top dr=2, dc=3:10, q=2-1=1, r=3-2=1, so (1,1)

But (1,1) is the same as what? Cell 6 was at bottom dr=0, dc=1:6, q=0-1= -1, r=1-2= -1, so (-1,-1)

Cell 7 at bottom dr=0, dc=2:7, q= -1, r=0

Cell 8 at bottom dr=0, dc=3:8, q= -1, r=1

Cell 9 at middle dr=1, dc=4:9, q=0, r=2

Cell 10 at top dr=2, dc=3:10, q=1, r=1

Cell 11 at ? not in diagram, but should be at (2,2) or something, but (2,2) is cell 3 at q=2-1=1, r=2-2=0, so (1,0), occupied by 7? 7 is at (-1,0)

So cell 11 at (1,2)? But (1,2) is cell 1? No, cell 1 at (1,2) in original, q=0, r=0.

So available.

From 10 at (1,1) to 11 at (1,2)? But (1,2) is not adjacent to (1,1)? Delta q=0, delta r=1, which is a neighbor, yes.

Then to 12 at (1,3), and so on.

But in ring 2, k=2, should have 12 cells, from 8 to 19.

Cells: 8 at (-1,1), 9 at (0,2), 10 at (1,1), 11 at (1,2), 12 at (1,3), 13 at (0,3), 14 at (-1,2), 15 at (-1,0)? Let's list the path.

From 7 at (-1,0) to 8 at (-1,1)  // east

Then to 9 at (0,2)  // from (-1,1) to (0,2): delta q=1, delta r=1, which is northeast

Then to 10 at (1,1)  // from (0,2) to (1,1): delta q=1, delta r= -1, southeast

Then to 11 at (1,2)  // east

Then to 12 at (1,3)  // east

Then to 13 at (0,3)  // from (1,3) to (0,3): delta q= -1, delta r=0, north

Then to 14 at (-1,2)  // from (0,3) to (-1,2): delta q= -1, delta r= -1, northwest

Then to 15 at (-1,1)  // but (-1,1) is 8, occupied, so must be to (-1,3) or something.

From 14 at (-1,2) to 15 at (-1,3)  // east

Then to 16 at (0,4)  // northeast, and so on.

Yes, so the path is defined.

To find the coordinates for a given number, we can use the ring and position.

For a number n, find ring k such that S(k-1) < n <= S(k), with S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Then the first number of ring k is a_k = S(k-1) + 1 = 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

Then the position in the ring p = n - a_k + 1

Then the side s = floor((p-1)/k)  // since each side has k cells, s from 0 to 5

Then the index on the side i = (p-1) mod k  // from 0 to k-1

Then the coordinates can be determined based on s and i.

The ring starts at a specific corner.

From the path, for ring k, it starts at the cell that is in the "southeast" or "east" direction from the end of previous ring.

For example, ring 1 starts at (0,1) which is east of center (0,0)

Ring 2 starts at (-1,1) which is northeast of the end of ring 1 at (1,0)? From (1,0) to (-1,1): delta q= -2, delta r=1, not adjacent, but in the path, from 7 at (1,0) to 8 at (-1,1), but in our calculation, 7 is at (-1,0), 8 at (-1,1), so from (-1,0) to (-1,1), which is east.

So the start of ring k is at the same "direction" as the end of ring k-1, but in the next ring.

Generally, the start of ring k is at a corner, and the direction of the first move is the same as the last move of previous ring.

For ring 1, last cell 7 at (1,0), and it was moving east to there? From 6 at (0,-1) to 7 at (1,0): delta q=1, delta r=1, which is southeast, then to 8 at (-1,1)? Not.

From the path: after cell 6 at (0,-1), to 7 at (1,0): delta q=1, delta r=1 ( southeast)

Then from 7 to 8: to (-1,1), delta q= -2, delta r=1, not adjacent, but in our corrected, 7 at (-1,0), to 8 at (-1,1), delta q=0, delta r=1 (east)

So the last move of ring 1 is from 6 to 7: from (0,-1) to (1,0): delta q=1, delta r=1 (southeast)

Then for ring 2, it starts at 8 at (-1,1), which is not adjacent, but the first move is to 9 at (0,2): from (-1,1) to (0,2): delta q=1, delta r=1 (southeast again? But southeast from (-1,1) is (0,2)? (q+1,r+1) but our offsets are (q,r+1), etc, not (q+1,r+1).

In our neighbor offsets, the possible moves are only to the six neighbors, so the direction is one of the six vectors.

From the end of ring k-1 to the start of ring k, it is to a neighbor cell, which is not in the previous rings, so in the next ring.

For example, from 7 at (1,0) in some coord, but in our coord, from 7 at (-1,0), the neighbors are (-1,1), (-1,-1), (0,0), (0,-1), (-2,0), (-2,-1) , but (0,0) is 1, occupied, (0,-1) is 6, occupied, (-1,-1) is 4, occupied, so only (-1,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1) are free, and it chooses (-1,1) for 8.

So the start of ring k is at a cell that is adjacent to the end of ring k-1, and not in previous rings.

For each ring, the starting cell is at a corner, and the first side is in the "east" direction for ring 1, but for higher rings, it may be different.

To simplify, we can find the coordinates based on the ring and position.

For a cell in ring k, at position p (1 to 6k), the coordinates (q,r) can be expressed as a function of k and p.

The ring k starts at a cell with coordinates, say for k=1, (0,1)

For k=2, (-1,1)

For k=3, (-1,2) or something.

From earlier, for k=1:
p=1:2 at (0,1)
p=2:3 at (-1,0)
p=3:4 at (-1,-1)
p=4:5 at (0,-1)
p=5:6 at (1,-1)
p=6:7 at (1,0)

For k=2:
p=1:8 at (-1,1)
p=2:9 at (0,2)
p=3:10 at (1,1)
p=4:11 at (1,2)
p=5:12 at (1,3)
p=6:13 at (0,3)
p=7:14 at (-1,2)
p=8:15 at (-1,3)
p=9:16 at (0,4)
p=10:17 at (1,4)
p=11:18 at (1,5)
p=12:19 at (0,5) or something.

From earlier path, after 13 at (0,3), to 14 at (-1,2), then to 15 at (-1,3), then to 16 at (0,4), etc.

So 8: (-1,1)
9: (0,2)
10: (1,1)
11: (1,2)
12: (1,3)
13: (0,3)
14: (-1,2)
15: (-1,3)
16: (0,4)
17: (1,4)
18: (1,5)
19: (0,5) or (2,4)? Let's see from 18 at (1,5) to 19: probably to (0,5) or (2,4), but (0,5) is north, (2,4) is southeast.

In the spiral, after 18, it should turn, but since side has k=2 cells, and we are at the end of a side, so turn.

From 17 to 18: from (1,4) to (1,5): east
Then from 18 to 19: turn left to northeast, so to (0,5) or to (2,5)? From (1,5) , northeast might be (0,5) or (0,6), but (0,5) is available, so likely 19 at (0,5)

Then to 20 at (-1,4), etc.

So for k=2, p=12:19 at (0,5)

Now, general formula.

Notice that for a given k, the starting cell has coordinates that depend on k.

For k=1, start at (0,1)
k=2, start at (-1,1)
k=3, likely at (-1,2) or (-2,1), but let's calculate.

S(2)=19, so ring 3 starts at 20 at S(2)+1=20

First cell of ring 3 at 20.

From end of ring 2 at 19 at (0,5), neighbors are (0,6), (0,4), (-1,5), (-1,4), (1,5), (1,4)

(1,5) is 18, occupied, (1,4) is 17, occupied, (0,4) is 16, occupied, ( -1,5) may be free, (0,6), (-1,4)

Likely it goes to (0,6) or (-1,5).

From the pattern, after moving east to 19, turn left to northeast, so to ( -1,5) or (0,6).

If to ( -1,5), delta q= -1, delta r=0, north

If to (0,6), delta q=0, delta r=1, east, but turning left from east should be to northeast, which is not east.

From (0,5) , northeast neighbor is ( -1,5) or ( -1,6)? In our offset, the neighbors are (0,6), (0,4), (-1,5), (-1,4), (1,5), (1,4)

( -1,5) is at delta q= -1, delta r=0, which is north, not northeast.

Perhaps the direction is not matching.

Assume it goes to ( -1,5) for 20.

Then to 21 at (-1,6) east, then to 22 at (0,7) northeast, etc.

But let's not guess; we can derive the coordinates.

Notice that for a cell in ring k, the Manhattan distance or the distance from center can be defined.

In this grid, the distance from (0,0) can be calculated as max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) or something, but in this case, for cell at (q,r), the ring k is such that the L1 distance or something.

For example, cell (0,1): |q| + |r| = 0+1=1, ring 1

( -1,0): 1+0=1, ring 1

(0,-1):1, (1,0):1, etc.

(0,2): |0|+|2|=2, but in ring 2 for cell 9

( -1,1): | -1| + |1| =2, ring 2

(1,1):2, ring 2

(0,3):3, but in ring 2 for cell 13, |0|+|3|=3, but ring 2 should be distance 2, so not L1 distance.

Perhaps the ring k is max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) or something.

For (0,1): max(0,1,1)=1

( -1,0): max(1,0,1)=1

(0,2): max(0,2,2)=2

( -1,1): max(1,1,0)=1? But it should be 2 for ring 2.

| q | + |r| - |q r| or something.

Notice that the ring k is the minimum number such that the cell is within distance k, but in hex grid, distance is the number of steps.

From (0,0), distance 1 cells are the six neighbors: (0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(1,0),(1,-1)

Distance 2 cells are those at distance 2, like (0,2),(0,-2),(-1,1),(-1,-2),(1,1),(1,-2),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(2,0),(2,-1),( -1, -1) but (-1,-1) is distance 1, etc.

Cell (0,2): from (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2), distance 2

( -1,1): from (0,0) to (-1,0) to (-1,1), or to (0,1) to (-1,1), distance 2

(1,1): to (1,0) to (1,1), distance 2

( -2,0): distance 2

But also (0,0) itself distance 0.

For ring k, it contains all cells at distance k from center.

Distance 0: 1 cell

Distance 1: 6 cells

Distance 2: 12 cells? But in hex grid, number of cells at distance d is 6d for d>0.

Distance 0: 1 cell

Distance 1: 6 cells

Distance 2: cells like (0,2),(0,-2),(-2,0),(2,0),( -2,-2),(2,-2)? No.

From (0,0), cells at exactly distance 2: for example, (0,2): path length 2

(1,1): path (1,0) then (1,1), or (0,1) then (1,1), length 2

( -1,1): length 2

(2,0): length 2

( -2,0): length 2

(1,-1): but (1,-1) is a neighbor, distance 1

(0,2), (0,-2), (-2,0), (2,0), (-1,1), (-1,-1)? but (-1,-1) distance 1

List all cells with shortest path length 2.

- (0,2): via (0,1)

- (0,-2): via (0,-1)

- (2,0): via (1,0)

- (-2,0): via (-1,0)

- (1,1): via (1,0) or (0,1)

- (-1,1): via (-1,0) or (0,1)

- (1,-1): but (1,-1) is adjacent, distance 1

- (-1,-1): distance 1

- (2,-1): from (1,0) to (2,-1)? But (2,-1) may not be neighbor; from (1,0) neighbors are (1,1),(1,-1),(0,0),(0,-1),(2,0),(2,-1) — yes, (2,-1) is neighbor of (1,0), so from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,-1), distance 2

Similarly, (-2,-1), etc.

So cells at distance 2: (0,2),(0,-2),(2,0),(-2,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(2,-1),(-2,-1),(1,-2),(-1,-2), etc.

Specifically, the cells where max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) =2 or something.

For (0,2): |q|=0, |r|=2, |q+r|=2, max=2

For (1,1): |1|,|1|,|2|, max=2

For (2,0): |2|,|0|,|2|, max=2

For (2,-1): |2|,|1|,|1|, max=2

For (1,-2): |1|,|2|,|-1|=1, max=2

For (-1,2): max=2

 etc.

And for distance 1: max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) =1, since for (0,1):0,1,1 max1; (1,0):1,0,1 max1; (1,-1):1,1,0 max1

For distance 0: (0,0):0,0,0 max0

So in general, the ring k (distance k) consists of cells with max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) = k

And there are 6k cells in ring k, for k>=1.

Now, for a cell in ring k, with position p in 1 to 6k, we can find (q,r).

The cell is on one of the six sides, each with k cells.

The sides can be classified by the direction where the max is achieved.

For example, if |r| = k and |r| >= |q| and |r| >= |q+r|, then on the north or south side, but in our case, r is not necessarily vertical.

Since the grid is symmetric, we can define the side based on the values.

The starting cell for each ring is at (k,0) or something, but from earlier:

For k=1, cells include (0,1), which has r=1, q=0, max(0,1,1)=1, and it is the first cell.

For k=2, first cell at (-1,1), max(1,1,0)=1? max=1, but should be distance 2. max(|-1|,|1|,|-1+1|)=max(1,1,0)=1, but it should be in ring 2, distance 2. Contradiction.

For (-1,1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |q+r|=0, max=1, distance 1, but in our earlier, for k=2, cell 8 at (-1,1), and distance from (0,0): path (0,0) to (-1,0) to (-1,1), distance 2, so max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) = max(1,1,0)=1, but distance is 2, so this measure is not the distance.

In this grid, the distance is not given by that formula.

From (0,0) to (-1,1): shortest path: (0,0) -> (-1,0) -> (-1,1) or (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1), length 2, so distance 2.

But max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) = max(1,1,0) =1, which is not the distance.

So that formula is incorrect for this grid.

Perhaps the distance is (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2 with s= -q-r, but in cube coordinates, distance = (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 with q+r+s=0.

For cell at (q,r), s = -q-r, then distance = (|q| + |r| + | -q-r|)/2 = (|q| + |r| + |q+r|)/2

For (0,1): (0+1+1)/2 =1

For (-1,1): (1+1+0)/2 =2/2=1, but should be 2. (|-1| + |1| + |-1+1|)/2 = (1+1+0)/2=1, but distance is 2, so not.

For (-1,1): if we go (0,0) -> (-1,0) -> (-1,1), distance 2, and (| -1| + |1| + | -1+1|)/2 = (1+1+0)/2=1, not 2.

So not cube distance.

Perhaps it's the L1 distance in axial coordinates, but axial L1 distance for (0,0) to (-1,1) is | -1-0| + |1-0| =1+1=2, yes.

In axial coordinates, the distance between (q1,r1) and (q2,r2) is (|dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr|)/2? No, in standard axial coordinates for hex grid, the distance is max(|dq|, |dr|, | -dq-dr|) or something, but usually it's derived from cube.

Standard axial distance: if we have q and r, with s = -q-r, then distance = max(|q1-q2|, |r1-r2|, |s1-s2|) = max(|dq|, |dr|, | -dq-dr|) = max(|dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr|)

For (0,0) to (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, |dq+dr|=|0|=0, max=1, but actual distance 2, so not.

Perhaps it's (|dq| + |dr|) as in Manhattan, but for (0,0) to (0,1): |0| + |1| =1, good; to (-1,1): | -1| + |1| =2, good; to (1,0):1, good; to (1,-1): |1| + |-1| =2, good; to (0,2):2, good; to (2,0):2, good; to (1,1): |1| + |1| =2, good; to (0,3):3, etc.

So in this coordinate system, the distance from (0,0) is |q| + |r|.

For cell at (q,r), distance d = |q| + |r|.

Then for ring k, distance k, so |q| + |r| = k.

Number of cells with |q| + |r| = k.

For fixed k, q can range from -k to k, r = k - |q|, but only if r is integer, and for each q, r is determined? No.

| q | + | r | = k, so for each q from -k to k, r can be k - |q|, but only if k - |q| >=0, and then r = k - |q| or r = - (k - |q|)? No.

| q | + | r | = k means that for each q, |r| = k - |q|, so r = k - |q| or r = - (k - |q|).

But only if k - |q| >=0, i.e., |q| <= k.

So for each q from -k to k, there are two r: r = k - |q| and r = - (k - |q|), except when k - |q| =0, then r=0 only once.

When |q| = k, r=0, one cell.

When |q| < k, two cells: r = k - |q| and r = - (k - |q|).

But for example k=1: q from -1 to 1.

q= -1: |q|=1, k-|q|=0, r=0, cell (-1,0)

q=0: |q|=0, k-|q|=1, r=1 or r= -1, cells (0,1), (0,-1)

q=1: |q|=1, r=0, cell (1,0)

So cells: (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0) — but we have six cells, missing two: (-1,-1), (1,-1)

For ( -1,-1): |q| + |r| =1+1=2, not 1.

So for distance 1, only four cells, but we have six, so not.

This is not working.

Perhaps the grid is not with this metric.

From the values, for a given k, the cells in ring k have a range of q and r.

For example, for k=1: cells at (0,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (1,0)

So q from -1 to 1, r from -1 to 1, but not all.

The values are: min q = -1, max q = 1, min r = -1, max r = 1, but missing (0,0), (1,1), etc.

The ring k has cells with max(|q|, |r|) = k, but for k=1, max(|q|,|r|) =1 for all except (0,0), and there are 8 cells, but we have 6, so not.

Notice that in the list for k=1, the cells are those with |q| + |r| = 1 for some, but ( -1,-1) has | -1| + | -1| =2.

Perhaps |q| + |r| - |q r| or something.

Let's calculate the sum |q| + |r| for the cells in ring k.

For k=1: (0,1):0+1=1

(-1,0):1+0=1

(-1,-1):1+1=2

(0,-1):0+1=1

(1,-1):1+1=2

(1,0):1+0=1

So values 1 or 2, not constant.

Perhaps the ring is determined by the chessboard distance or something.

Another idea: from the initial move, and the spiral path, for each ring, the starting cell has coordinates (k,0) for k even, or something.

For k=1: start at (0,1)

k=2: start at (-1,1)

k=3: start at (-1,2) or ( -2,1)

Assume that for ring k, the starting cell is at (k-1, 1) or something.

For k=1: (0,1) yes

k=2: (1,1)? but we have (-1,1)

Perhaps (0,1) for k=1, then for k=2, it is at ( -1,1), which is left and up.

Perhaps in general, the start of ring k is at (1-k, 1) for k>=1.

For k=1: (1-1,1)=(0,1) good

k=2: (1-2,1)=(-1,1) good

k=3: (1-3,1)=(-2,1)

Then the first side is in the "northwest" direction or something.

From the start cell, it moves in a direction for k cells, then turns 60 degrees left, and so on.

For example, for ring 1: start at (0,1)

Then it moves in which direction? To 3 at (-1,0), which is delta q= -1, delta r= -1, so southwest or northwest.

From (0,1) to (-1,0): delta q= -1, delta r= -1

Then from there to 4 at (-1,-1): delta q=0, delta r= -1, south or west.

Then to 5 at (0,-1): delta q=1, delta r=0, east or north.

 etc.

For general k, at start cell (1-k, 1)

Then the first move is in the direction of vector (-1,-1) for k cells.

For k=1: from (0,1) move to (-1,0) , which is vector (-1,-1), and since k=1, only one cell, so ends at (-1,0)

For k=2: start at (-1,1), move vector (-1,-1) for 2 cells: first to (-1,1) + (-1,-1) = (-2,0), then to (-2,0) + (-1,-1) = (-3,-1)

But in our earlier, for k=2, after start at (-1,1), it goes to (0,2), which is vector (1,1), not (-1,-1).

So not.

Perhaps the direction depends on k.

From the end of previous ring to the start of next, it is in a consistent direction.

From end of ring k-1 to start of ring k: for k=2, end of ring 1 at (1,0), start of ring 2 at (-1,1), delta q= -2, delta r=1, not good.

In our coord, end of ring 1 at (1,0), start of ring 2 at (-1,1), not adjacent.

But in the path, it is adjacent because it is the same cell or something, but no.

In the spiral, the cell after the last of ring k-1 is the first of ring k, and they are adjacent.

For example, cell 7 (last of ring 1) at (1,0), cell 8 (first of ring 2) at (-1,1), and they are adjacent, as per the grid: from (1,0) to (-1,1), is it a neighbor? In our neighbor offsets, from (1,0) to (-1,1): delta q= -2, delta r=1, not in the neighbor list; the neighbors are at (1,1),(1,-1),(0,0),(0,-1),(2,0),(2,-1), none is (-1,1).

So not adjacent, but in the spiral, 7 and 8 are adjacent? In the diagram, cell 7 at bottom dc=2, cell 8 at bottom dc=3, so if same row, then adjacent if next column, so in our coord, both at dr=0, dc=2 and dc=3, so q= -1, r=0 for 7, q= -1, r=1 for 8, so same q, r differs by 1, so yes, adjacent, and in the same row, so if flat-top, and same dr, then (dr, dc+1) is neighbor, so yes.

In our earlier neighbor list, for a cell, one of the neighbors is (q, r+1), so for cell at (q,r), (q,r+1) is a neighbor.

For 7 at ( -1,0), neighbor at ( -1,1) which is 8, yes.

And from 7 to 8 is east, same direction as the last move of ring 1: from 6 to 7 was from (0,-1) to (1,0): delta q=1, delta r=1, which is southeast, not east.

So the direction changes.

For the first cell of ring k, it is at (1-k, 1) as before.

Then the first side is in the direction of vector (0,1) for k cells? For k=1: from (0,1) , but it doesn't move; it is the cell.

For k>1, it moves in a direction.

For k=2: from (-1,1) move to ( -1,2)? But in our case, it went to (0,2), not ( -1,2).

Perhaps it moves in the direction of the last turn.

To save time, for our purpose, we have 2026 in ring k=26, p=75.

Total cells in ring 26: 6*26=156 cells.

Each side has 26 cells.

The sides are numbered 0 to 5.

The first side (s=0) is in the "east" direction, so from the start cell, it moves in +r direction, i.e., increasing r, same q.

For example, for k=1, s=0: cell at (0,1), and it doesn't move, so only one cell at (0,1)

For k=2, s=0: cells from p=1 to p=2: 8 at (-1,1), 9 at (0,2)? But in our, 8 at (-1,1), then 9 at (0,2), which is not same q; q changed from -1 to 0.

So not pure r increase.

For s=0, it may be in a different direction.

Perhaps for each side, the direction is constant, and for s=0, it is +r, for s=1, it is -q, etc.

Assume that for side s, the direction is given by a vector.

From the first cell, for side s, it moves in direction v_s for i=0 to k-1, and the cell is at start + i * v_s.

For example, for ring 1:
s=0: p=1, cell 2 at (0,1)
s=1: p=2, cell 3 at (-1,0)
s=2: p=3, cell 4 at (-1,-1)
s=3: p=4, cell 5 at (0,-1)
s=4: p=5, cell 6 at (1,-1)
s=5: p=6, cell 7 at (1,0)

So the start of each side is at:
s=0: (0,1)
s=1: (-1,0)
s=2: (-1,-1)
s=3: (0,-1)
s=4: (1,-1)
s=5: (1,0)

And for each side, since k=1, only one cell, no move.

For ring 2:
s=0: p=1-2: 8 at (-1,1), 9 at (0,2)
So from (-1,1) to (0,2), which is vector (1,1)

s=1: p=3-4: 10 at (1,1), 11 at (1,2) vector (0,1)

s=2: p=5-6: 12 at (1,3), 13 at (0,3) vector (-1,0)

s=3: p=7-8: 14 at (-1,2), 15 at (-1,3) vector (0,1)

s=4: p=9-10: 16 at (0,4), 17 at (1,4) vector (1,0)

s=5: p=11-12: 18 at (1,5), 19 at (0,5) vector (-1,0)

So the vectors for each side s:
s=0: (1,1)
s=1: (0,1)
s=2: (-1,0)
s=3: (0,1)
s=4: (1,0)
s=5: (-1,0)

Not consistent; s=1 and s=3 both (0,1), s=2 and s=5 both (-1,0), etc.

For s=0: (1,1)
s=1: (0,1)
s=2: (-1,0)
s=3: (0,1) same as s=1
s=4: (1,0)
s=5: (-1,0) same as s=2

So not unique per s.

Perhaps it depends on the ring or on the starting point.

For a given k, the start cell is at (1-k, 1)

Then for side 0, it moves in direction (1,0) or something.

For k=2, start at (-1,1)
Then for i=0: cell at (-1,1)
i=1: cell at (-1,1) + v

In the cell 9 at (0,2), so v = (1,1)

Then for side 1, start at cell 10 at (1,1), which is (-1,1) + 2*(1,1) = (0,2)? But 9 is at (0,2), not 10.

After two cells for s=0: at i=0: (-1,1), i=1: (0,2)

Then s=1 starts at (1,1)

How to get from (0,2) to (1,1)? Not adjacent; in the path, from 9 at (0,2) to 10 at (1,1), which is vector (1,-1)

So the turn is made, and the new direction is different.

For each side, the direction is rotated by 60 degrees left from the previous.

For s=0, direction d0

For s=1, d1 = rotate left 60 degrees from d0, etc.

The initial direction for s=0 of ring k is the same as the last direction of ring k-1.

For ring 1, last cell 7 at (1,0), and it was moved from 6 at (0,-1) to (1,0) with vector (1,1)

Then for ring 2, s=0, first cell 8 at (-1,1), but the direction for s=0 is from 8 to 9: from (-1,1) to (0,2), vector (1,1), same as last direction of ring 1.

Then for s=1, rotate left 60 degrees from (1,1).

What is rotate left 60 degrees of vector (1,1)?

In hex grid, rotating a vector by 60 degrees.

The vectors are: (0,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), or something.

The six directions can be represented by vectors: let's say v0 = (0,1) east
v1 = (1,0) southeast
v2 = (1,-1) southwest
v3 = (0,-1) west
v4 = (-1,0) northwest
v5 = (-1,1) northeast

Then rotating left (ccw) : from v0 to v5, v1 to v0, etc.

From v_i to v_{i-1 mod 6}

For example, (1,1) is not in this list; the vectors have sum 0 or 1 in some way.

In our case, the move vectors have different lengths; (1,1) has length sqrt(2), while (0,1) has length 1, so not unit vectors.

In hex grid, all moves are to adjacent cells, so the vector should have length corresponding to distance 1, but in our coord, the distance between cells is not Euclidean; it's graph distance.

For example, from (0,0) to (0,1): delta q=0, delta r=1, and it is adjacent, so vector (0,1) is a move vector.

From (0,0) to (1,0): (1,0)
From (0,0) to (1,-1): (1,-1)
From (0,0) to (0,-1): (0,-1)
From (0,0) to (-1,0): (-1,0)
From (0,0) to (-1,1): (-1,1)  since from (0,0) to (-1,1) is not adjacent, but to (-1,0) is, so ( -1,0) is a vector, not (-1,1).

The move vectors to adjacent cells are exactly the six neighbor offsets: (0,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,0), (1,-1)

So the possible move vectors are these six: let's call them:
d0 = (0,1)  // east
d1 = (-1,0)  // north
d2 = (-1,-1) // northwest
d3 = (0,-1)  // west
d4 = (1,0)   // south
d5 = (1,-1)  // southwest? or southeast

For example, from (0,0), d0=(0,1): east
d1= (-1,0): north
d2= (-1,-1): northwest
d3= (0,-1): west
d4= (1,0): south
d5= (1,-1): southeast

Yes.

Now, rotating left 60 degrees: for example, from east (d0) rotate left to northeast, which is d5? d5=(1,-1), which is southeast, not northeast.

Northeast would be (-1,1) or something, but not in our vectors.

In our vectors, the directions are not equally spaced in terms of angle, but in terms of grid.

The left rotate of a vector: for example, from d0=(0,1) (east), rotate left to d1= (-1,0) ( north)? But north is 90 degrees, while in hex, 60 degrees.

From east, rotate 60 degrees left should be to northeast, which in our case might be the direction to (-1,1), but that's not a single move; it's not a neighbor in that direction.

Perhaps for the move direction, when moving in a straight line for a side, the vector is not necessarily a neighbor vector, but the cell is at start + i * v, with v a vector that is not a unit move, but for multiple steps.

In the side, for example in ring 2, s=0: from 8 at (-1,1) to 9 at (0,2), vector (1,1), which is not a unit vector, but the cells are not adjacent if |v| >1, but in this case from (-1,1) to (0,2), is it adjacent? In our grid, distance between (-1,1) and (0,2): delta q=1, delta r=1, and in our earlier, for cell at (q,r), distance to (q+1,r+1) is |1| + |1| =2, not 1, so not adjacent, but in the spiral, 8 and 9 are adjacent? In the diagram, cell 8 at bottom dc=3, cell 9 at middle dc=4, so if different rows, may not be adjacent, but in the path, they are consecutive, so must be adjacent.

In our grid, from cell at (q,r) = (-1,1) (8), neighbors are (-1,2), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,0), (-2,1), (-2,0)

Cell 9 is at (0,2), which is not in this list; the list has (0,1), not (0,2).

So not adjacent, but in the spiral, 8 and 9 are consecutive numbers, so they must be adjacent cells.

In the diagram, cell 8 is at bottom row dc=3, cell 9 at middle row dc=4, so if the grid is hexagonal, they might be adjacent if the rows are offset.

In our earlier successful neighbor list, for a cell, the neighbors are only the six with the specific offsets, and for cell 8 at (-1,1), neighbors are (-1,2), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,0), (-2,1), (-2,0)

Cell 9 is at (0,2), which is not in this list, so not adjacent, but in the number sequence, 8 and 9 are consecutive, so they must be adjacent in the spiral path, so our coordinate assignment or neighbor definition must be wrong for those cells.

Perhaps for cell 9 at (0,2), its neighbors include (-1,1), but let's calculate distance.

From (-1,1) to (0,2): delta q=1, delta r=1, |dq| + |dr| =2, while for adjacent cells, |dq| + |dr| =1 for some, but in our case, for example from (0,0) to (0,1): |0| + |1| =1, adjacent; to (1,0):1, adjacent; to (1,-1):|1|+|-1|=2, and it is adjacent, as per earlier for cell 1.

For cell 1 at (0,0), neighbor at (1,-1), and |1| + |-1| =2, but it is adjacent, so the distance is not |q| + |r|; in this grid, cells are adjacent if they differ by one of the six vectors, and the Euclidean distance may vary, but the graph distance is 1 for those.

So for (-1,1) and (0,2), delta q=1, delta r=1, which is not one of the six vectors; the six vectors are (0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(1,0),(1,-1), none is (1,1) or (1,1).

(1,1) is not in the list, so not adjacent.

But in the spiral, 8 and 9 must be adjacent, so perhaps in the grid, cell 8 at (0,3) or something.

Let's list the coordinates again.

From the diagram:
Bottom row (dr=0): dc=0:16, dc=1:6, dc=2:7, dc=3:8

Middle row (dr=1): dc=0:15, dc=1:5, dc=2:1, dc=3:2, dc=4:9

Top row (dr=2): dc=0:14, dc=1:4, dc=2:3, dc=3:10

Cell 8 at (0,3) (dr=0, dc=3)

Cell 9 at (1,4) (dr=1, dc=4)

Now, are they adjacent? For cell 8 at (0,3), neighbors for flat-top with dr even (since 0 even):

- E: (0,4) — not present
- W: (0,2):7
- NW: (-1,3) — not present or out
- NE: (-1,4) — not
- SW: (1,3) — not present; in middle row, dc=3 is 2, so (1,3):2
- SE: (1,4):9

So SE neighbor is (1,4):9, yes! So for dr even, SE neighbor is (dr+1, dc+1)

In this case, for cell 8 at (0,3) dr even, SE neighbor is (1,4):9, so they are adjacent.

Similarly, for cell 9 at (1,4) dr=1 odd, its neighbors include (0,3):8 as NW or something.

So in general, the neighbor offsets depend on the row parity, as is standard for flat-top hex grids.

For a cell at (dr,dc), if dr even, neighbors:
- (dr, dc+1) : E
- (dr, dc-1) : W
- (dr-1, dc) : NW
- (dr-1, dc+1) : NE
- (dr+1, dc) : SW
- (dr+1, dc+1) : SE

If dr odd, neighbors:
- (dr, dc+1) : E
- (dr, dc-1) : W
- (dr-1, dc-1) : NW
- (dr-1, dc) : NE
- (dr+1, dc-1) : SW
- (dr+1, dc) : SE

And this is consistent with the diagram.

For the center 1 at (1,2) dr=1 odd, neighbors:
- E: (1,3):2
- W: (1,1):5
- NW: (1-1,1-1)=(0,0):16? but should be 4 or something. (0,0) is bottom dc=0:16, but in our, it should be 4 or 3.

Cell 4 is at (2,1) top row, dr=2, dc=1

For (1,2) dr odd, NW: (dr-1, dc-1)=(0,1): in bottom row dc=1:6, but should be 4.

Mistake in row numbering.

If bottom row dr=0, middle dr=1, top dr=2, then cell 4 at top dr=2, dc=1:4

For cell 1 at (1,2) dr=1 odd, NW: (dr-1, dc-1)=(0,1): bottom dc=1:6

But we want it to be 4, which is at (2,1)

So perhaps dr should increase upwards.

Set dr=0 for top, dr=1 for middle, dr=2 for bottom.

Then cell 1 at (1,2) (middle row, dc=2)

Cell 4 at (0,1) (top row, dc=1)

Cell 6 at (2,1) (bottom row, dc=1)

For cell 1 at (1,2) dr=1, which is odd if we consider the number, but dr is the row number.

Assume dr=1 is odd.

Then neighbors for odd dr:
- E: (1,3):2
- W: (1,1):5
- NW: (1-1,1-1)=(0,0): top dc=0:14
- NE: (1-1,1)=(0,1):4
- SW: (1+1,1-1)=(2,0): bottom dc=0:16
- SE: (1+1,1)=(2,1):6

So neighbors: 2,5,14,4,16,6, which is not correct; should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Cell 3 is at (0,2) top dc=2:3, which is not in the list.

For NE: (0,1):4, but not (0,2).

So not.

Perhaps for this cell, since it's in the middle, but to make it work, in the first successful calculation, we had it at (1,2) with even dr, but in that case for even dr, NW is (dr-1, dc)=(0,2):3, NE is (0,3):10, but we had (0,1):4 for some.

In our very first successful list, when we had neighbors as 2,3,4,5,6,7 for 1 at (1,2), with:
- (1,3):2
- (1,1):5
- (0,2):3
- (0,1):4
- (2,2):7
- (2,1):6

And for even dr, if we use the even dr formula:
- E: (1,3):2
- W: (1,1):5
- NW: (0,2):3
- NE: (0,3):10  but we have (0,1):4, not 10.

So not matching.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different, or we need to use a different approach.

For the sake of time, since we know 2026 is in ring 26, position 75, and each side has 26 cells, we can find which side it is on and its position on the side, and then from the geometry, the neighbors can be determined.

For a cell in ring k, not on a corner, it has:
- the next cell in the ring
- the previous cell in the ring
- two cells in ring k-1
- two cells in ring k+1

At a corner, it may have only one in some, but in hex grid, usually six neighbors.

For example, in ring 1, cell 2: neighbors include 1 (k-1), 3 ( same ring), 7 ( same ring), and 8,9 (k+1), etc.

In general, for a cell on the side but not corner, the two adjacent in same ring, two in inner ring, two in outer ring.

For a cell on a corner, still six neighbors, but the distribution may be different.

For our purpose, we can find the position and calculate.

For 2026 in ring 26, p=75.

Total cells 156, so side s = floor((p-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846) = 2, since 0-based, s=2 ( third side)

Then index on the side i = (p-1) mod k = 74 mod 26 = 74 - 2*26 = 74-52=22, so i=22 (0-based, so 23rd cell on the side)

Since each side has 26 cells, and s=2, i=22.

Now, typically, the sides are: s=0: east or something
s=1: northeast
s=2: northwest
s=3: west
s=4: southwest
s=5: southeast

And for each side, the cells are numbered from 0 to k-1, with 0 at the start corner.

For a cell on a side, if it is not at corner, i.e., 0 < i < k-1, then it has two neighbors in the same ring: i-1 and i+1 on the same side.

Then for neighbors in ring k-1 and k+1, they are at corresponding positions.

In particular, for the sum of neighbors, since the grid is regular, the sum might depend only on the ring and the type of cell, but probably not, since the numbers are sequential.

Perhaps for a given cell, its neighbors' numbers can be found from its position.

Since the spiral is arithmetic, the neighbors might be at fixed offsets.

But let's calculate the coordinates for the cell.

Assume that the start of ring k is at (q0,r0) = (0, k) for k>=1? For k=1: (0,1) good
k=2: (0,2)? but we have (-1,1)

Perhaps (k-1, 1-k) or something.

From online sources or standard formula for hexagonal spiral, but since this is a problem, likely there is a formula.

Notice that the number at (q,r) can be found, but perhaps for the neighbors of 2026, we can find which numbers are at the neighbor coordinates.

So for a cell at (q,r), its neighbors are at (q,r+1), (q,r-1), (q-1,r), (q-1,r-1), (q+1,r), (q+1,r-1)

Then the number at each neighbor can be found from its (q,r).

So we need to find (q,r) for 2026.

From the ring, for a cell in ring k, |q| + |r| = k, or something, but earlier not.

From the path, the coordinate changes.

For a cell in ring k, the sum q + r might have a range.

For example, in ring 1: cells (0,1): q+ r=1
(-1,0): -1
(-1,-1): -2
(0,-1): -1
(1,-1):0
(1,0):1
So q+r from -2 to 1.

Not constant.

The product or other.

Perhaps the angle or the side determines q and r.

For given k, s, i, the coordinates (q,r) can be expressed.

For example, for s=0, i=0: (0,k) for k>=1? For k=1: (0,1) good
k=2: (0,2)? but we have (-1,1) for s=0 i=0

For k=2, s=0, i=0: (-1,1)
i=1: (0,2)

So q = i - 1, r = i + 1? For i=0: q= -1, r=1
i=1: q=0, r=2, so q = i - 1, r = i + 1

For s=1, i=0: (1,1) for cell 10
i=1: (1,2) for cell 11

So q = 1, r = 1 + i

For s=2, i=0: (1,3) cell 12
i=1: (0,3) cell 13

So q = 1 - i, r = 3

 r constant.

For s=3, i=0: (-1,2) cell 14
i=1: (-1,3) cell 15
 so q = -1, r = 2 + i

s=4, i=0: (0,4) cell 16
i=1: (1,4) cell 17
 so q = i, r = 4

s=5, i=0: (1,5) cell 18
i=1: (0,5) cell 19
 q = 1 - i, r = 5

So general for k=2:
s=0: q = i - 1, r = i + 1
s=1: q = 1, r = 1 + i
s=2: q = 1 - i, r = 3
s=3: q = -1, r = 2 + i
s=4: q = i, r = 4
s=5: q = 1 - i, r = 5

 r is not consistent; for s=2, r=3, s=3 r=2+i, etc.

Notice that for each s, the start cell has r = k, or something.

For s=0: start at i=0: (-1,1) r=1
s=1: (1,1) r=1
s=2: (1,3) r=3
 not.

Perhaps q and r in terms of k, s, i.

For s=0: q = i - k + 1, r = i + 1  for k=2, i-1, i+1, so q = i - (k-1), r = i + 1

For k=2, q = i -1, r = i+1

For s=1: q = k - 1, r = k - 1 + i  for k=2, q=1, r=1+i

For s=2: q = k - 1 - i, r = 2k - 1  for k=2, q=1-i, r=3

For s=3: q = - (k - 1), r = k - 1 + i  for k=2, q= -1, r=1+i

For s=4: q = i - (k - 1), r = 2k - 2 + i? for k=2, q=i-1, r=2+i, but in s=4, r=4 for i=0, not 2+i=2 for i=0.

Not good.

Perhaps for each s, the expression is different, and for general k, we can write.

For s=0: q = i - (k - 1), r = i + 1

For s=1: q = k - 1, r = (k - 1) + i

For s=2: q = (k - 1) - i, r = 2k - 1

For s=3: q = - (k - 1), r = (k - 1) + i

For s=4: q = i - (k - 1), r = 2k - 2 + i? for k=2, r=2+i, but should be 4 for i=0.

For s=4: in k=2, r=4 for i=0, 4 for i=1? cell 16 at (0,4), 17 at (1,4), so r=4 for both, so r = 2k

For s=5: r=5 for both, 2k+1

So for k=2:
s=0: r = i+1
s=1: r = 1+i
s=2: r=3 =2*2-1
s=3: r=2+i
s=4: r=4=2*2
s=5: r=5=2*2+1

And q:
s=0: q = i-1
s=1: q=1
s=2: q=1-i
s=3: q= -1
s=4: q=i-1
s=5: q=1-i

Now for general k, likely:
s=0: q = i - (k - 1), r = i + 1
s=1: q = k - 1, r = (k - 1) + i
s=2: q = (k - 1) - i, r = 2k - 1
s=3: q = - (k - 1), r = (k - 1) + i
s=4: q = i - (k - 1), r = 2k
s=5: q = (k - 1) - i, r = 2k + 1

For k=2:
s=0: q=i-1, r=i+1 good
s=1: q=1, r=1+i good
s=2: q=1-i, r=3 good
s=3: q= -1, r=1+i good
s=4: q=i-1, r=4 good
s=5: q=1-i, r=5 good

For k=1: each side has 1 cell, i=0
s=0: q=0-0=0, r=0+1=1, cell (0,1) good
s=1: q=1-1=0, r=0+0=0? r=(k-1)+i=0+0=0, cell (0,0) but should be (-1,0)
Not good.

For k=1, it's special.

Since k=26 is large, and for k>1, the formula may work, and for k=1 not needed.

For s=1: q=k-1=0, r=0+0=0, but should be (-1,0)

So perhaps for s>0, adjust.

Notice that for s=0: (0,1) for k=1
s=1: (-1,0)
s=2: (-1,-1)
s=3: (0,-1)
s=4: (1,-1)
s=5: (1,0)

So for s=0: q=0, r=k=1
s=1: q= -k = -1, r=0
s=2: q= -k = -1, r= -k = -1
s=3: q=0, r= -k = -1
s=4: q=k=1, r= -k = -1
s=5: q=k=1, r=0

For k=1, good.

For k=2, s=0: q=0, r=2, but we have (-1,1), not (0,2)

So not.

Perhaps q and r are with respect to the start.

For given k, s, i, the cell is at a specific (q,r).

From the examples, for s=2, in both k=1 and k=2, the r is constant for the side.

In k=1 s=2: r= -1
k=2 s=2: r=3

Not constant.

Perhaps the sum q + r is constant for each side.

For k=1:
s=0: 0+1=1
s=1: -1+0= -1
s=2: -1-1= -2
s=3: 0-1= -1
s=4: 1-1=0
s=5: 1+0=1

For k=2:
s=0: for i=0: -1+1=0, i=1:0+2=2
 not constant.

This is taking too long. Perhaps for the neighbor sum, it is always 6 times the number or something, but unlikely.

Another idea: in many spirals, the sum of neighbors might be approximately 6 times the number, but with boundary effects, but for large n, it might be close, but 2026 is not that large, and we need exact.

Perhaps for a cell in ring k, the neighbors in ring k-1 and k+1 can be found from the position.

For example, for a cell not on a corner, there is a cell in ring k-1 that is " radially inward" and one in k+1 "outward", and also left and right in the ring.

But in hex grid, it's a bit complex.

Perhaps the number 2026 has neighbors that are 2025, 2027, and then 2026 - c, 2026 + d, etc., but not sequential.

Let's calculate the number at the neighbor positions once we have (q,r).

So for 2026, in ring 26, s=2, i=22.

Assume the formula for k>1.

From k=2 s=2: q = 1 - i, r = 3

For general k, perhaps s=2: q = (k-1) - i, r = 2k - 1

For k=26, s=2, i=22, so q = (26-1) - 22 = 25 - 22 = 3
 r = 2*26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51

So (q,r) = (3,51)

Then its neighbors are at:
- (3,52)  // (q,r+1)
- (3,50)  // (q,r-1)
- (2,51)  // (q-1,r)
- (2,50)  // (q-1,r-1)
- (4,51)  // (q+1,r)
- (4,50)  // (q+1,r-1)

Now, for each of these, find which ring it is in, and the number.

First, for a cell at (q,r), what is its ring k.

From the distance from (0,0), but since the grid is not Euclidean, we need the graph distance or the ring based on the spiral.

Since the spiral is filling by rings, and each ring is all cells at a certain distance, but in this grid, the distance may not be simply |q| + |r|.

From the coordinate, the ring k is the minimum number such that the cell is in or before ring k, but from the values, for example (0,0): ring 0
(0,1): ring 1
(-1,0): ring 1
(0,2): for cell 9 in ring 2, |0| + |2| =2, and ring 2 distance 2, so perhaps distance d = |q| + |r|, and ring d.

For (0,2): d=0+2=2, ring 2
(-1,1): d=1+1=2, ring 2
(1,1): d=1+1=2, ring 2
(2,0): d=2+0=2, ring 2
 etc.

For ( -1,-1): d=1+1=2, ring 1 for cell 4, but in ring 1, distance 1, but d=2, so not.

For cell 4 at (-1,-1): in ring 1, distance 1, but |q| + |r| =2, while distance 1 cells have |q| + |r| =1 for some, but for (1,0):1, (0,1):1, but for (1,-1):|1|+|-1|=2, and it is distance 1, as neighbor of (0,0).

So |q| + |r| is not the distance; for (0,0) to (1,-1): |1| + |-1| =2, but distance 1.

So distance is not |q| + |r|.

In this grid, the distance can be calculated as the number of steps, but for the ring, it is the distance from center.

For a cell at (q,r), the distance d can be found, and d = k for ring k.

From the filling, the cell is in ring d where d is its distance from (0,0).

To find d for (q,r), it is the shortest path length, which in this grid can be calculated.

From (0,0) to (q,r), the shortest path can be found using the grid topology.

Since the grid is a lattice with the given neighbor relations, the distance can be computed.

For example, from (0,0) to (q,r), the distance is max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) or something, but earlier not.

Notice that the moves allow changing q and r by ±1 in certain ways.

The distance might be max(|q|, |r|, |q+ r|) but for (1,-1): max(1,1,0)=1, and it is distance 1, good; for (0,1): max(0,1,1)=1, good; for (-1,1): max(1,1,0)=1, but distance 2, not good.

For (-1,1): from (0,0) to (-1,0) to (-1,1), distance 2, and max(|-1|,|1|,|-1+1|)=max(1,1,0)=1, not 2.

So not.

Perhaps the distance is |q| + |r| - min(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) or something.

For (0,0) to (q,r): in this grid, since the neighbors are at (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1), but not, only the six specific.

Perhaps it's the L1 distance in a different coordinate system.

Let's define new coordinates.

Let a = q, b = r - q or something.

Notice that the grid can be seen as a square grid with some cells missing, but perhaps not.

For the cell at (q,r), the ring k is given by k = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) or something, but for (1,-1): max(1,1,0)=1, good; for (0,1): max(0,1,1)=1, good; for (-1,1): max(1,1,0)=1, but should be 2.

Unless for (-1,1), |q+ r| = | -1+1| =0, |q|=1, |r|=1, max=1, but distance 2.

So not.

Perhaps k = |q| + |r| - |q r| / gcd or something, but complicated.

From the initial rings, the cell at (q,r) has distance d = |q| + |r| if q and r same sign or something, but not.

Let's calculate for several cells.

Cell (0,0): d=0
(0,1): d=1
(0,-1): d=1
(-1,0): d=1
(1,0): d=1
(-1,-1): d=1? cell 4, distance 1, | -1| + | -1| =2, but d=1
(1,-1): d=1, |1| + | -1| =2
(0,2): d=2, |0| + |2| =2
(-1,1): d=2, | -1| + |1| =2
(1,1): d=2, |1| + |1| =2
(2,0): d=2, |2| + |0| =2
(-2,0): d=2, etc.
(0,-2): d=2
( -1,-1): already d=1
(1,0): d=1

For ( -1,1): d=2, and |q| + |r| =2
For (0,0):0
(0,1):1
(1,-1):2? but d=1 for (1,-1)

For (1,-1): |1| + | -1| =2, but d=1, so not.

Unless for all cells, d = |q| + |r|, but (1,-1) has 2, but d=1, contradiction.

Perhaps in this coordinate system, the distance is floor(|q| + |r| / 1) but not.

Another idea: perhaps the ring k is floor((|q| + |r| +1)/2) or something, but for (0,0):0, (0,1): (0+1+1)/2=1, good; (1,-1):
