The problem involves natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a hexagonal grid. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the snippet:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

I see that 1 is in the center, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7? Looking at the neighbors of 1: directly above is 2? But in the grid, it's shown as:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3  10 ... — this might be offset.

Perhaps it's better to visualize the hexagon. In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. The center is 1. Around it, there should be six numbers. From the diagram:

Above 1 is 2? But in the second row, it's "15 5 1 2 9", so to the right of 1 is 2, and above-right is 9? This is confusing.

Let me list the positions. Assume the center is 1. Then, according to the grid:

- To the right of 1 is 2.

- Above-right is 9? But 9 is listed after 2, so probably in the same row.

The row is "15 5 1 2 9", but that's five numbers, and it's probably not aligned properly. Perhaps the grid is staggered.

In hexagonal grids, rows are offset. Looking at the numbers:

The sequence around 1: directly adjacent should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

From the diagram, to the right of 1 is 2. Then above 1 is probably 5? Since "5" is to the left of 1. So left is 5? But that doesn't make sense.

Let's see the neighbors. For 1, the six neighbors should be the cells adjacent to it.

In the grid: above 1 is? The row above has "14 4 3 10", but it's shifted.

Perhaps I should sketch this.

Let me denote the positions. Assume a hexagonal coordinate system. Often in hex grids, we use axial coordinates.

But maybe I can find a pattern by seeing how the numbers grow.

The spiral starts at 1, then goes to 2,3,4, etc.

From the snippet, after 1, it goes to 2 (right), then probably continues.

In the third row: "16 6 7 8", so 6,7,8 are below.

So sequence: center 1, then moving right to 2, then probably down-right or something to 3? But 3 is in the top row.

Top row has 14,4,3,10. So 3 and 4 are there.

Perhaps the spiral goes: from 1 to 2 (east), then to 3 (northeast), then to 4 (northwest), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (southwest), then to 7 (south), then to 8 (southeast), and so on.

Let me check with the numbers.

After 1, it goes to 2 (right). Then from 2, it should go to the next number. In the diagram, above 2 is 9? But 9 is listed after, so probably not adjacent.

The row is "15 5 1 2 9", so from left to right: 15,5,1,2,9. So 5 is west of 1, 2 is east, 9 is east of 2? But in hex grid, east of 2 might not be adjacent to 1.

I need to understand the layout.

Perhaps the grid is arranged such that each "ring" has more cells.

In a hexagonal spiral, the number of cells in each ring increases.

Recall that for a hexagonal grid, the k-th ring has 6k cells, for k≥1, and the center is k=0 with 1 cell.

Ring 0: 1 cell.

Ring 1: 6 cells.

Ring 2: 12 cells? No.

In a hexagonal lattice, the number of cells in ring k is 6k for k≥1, but ring 1 should have 6 cells, ring 2 should have 12, ring 3 18, etc., since each ring adds 6 more cells than the previous? No.

The total number of cells up to ring k is 1 + 6(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1).

For k=0: 1 cell.

k=1: 1 + 6 = 7 cells.

k=2: 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 cells? But in the diagram, we have numbers up to 16, and 16 is in the third row, so probably k=2 has 12 cells, total 19.

Numbers given: from 1 to 16, but 1 to 8 are shown, and 9 to 16 are mentioned, so total at least 16 cells, so likely rings.

Ring 0: cell 1.

Ring 1: cells 2 to 7. 6 cells.

Ring 2: cells 8 to 19. 12 cells? 8 to 19 is 12 cells, yes, since 19-8+1=12.

In the diagram, we have 16, which is in ring 2, since ring 2 starts at 8.

Now, the neighbors of a cell depend on its position in the ring.

But for 2026, it's large, so I need to find which ring it's in and its position.

First, find the ring number k such that the total cells up to ring k-1 < 2026 ≤ total cells up to ring k.

Total cells up to ring k: S(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1) ? Earlier I said 1 + 3k(k+1), but let's compute.

For k=0: S(0) = 1

k=1: S(1) = 1 + 6 = 7

k=2: S(2) = 1 + 6 + 12 = 19

k=3: S(3) = 19 + 18 = 37? Since ring 3 has 18 cells.

General: ring k has 6k cells for k≥1.

Ring 0: 1 cell.

So total cells up to ring k: T(k) = 1 + ∑_{m=1}^k 6m = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Yes.

T(k) = 3k^2 + 3k + 1

Now, find k such that T(k-1) < 2026 ≤ T(k)

T(k) = 3k^2 + 3k + 1

Set 3k^2 + 3k + 1 ≥ 2026

Solve 3k^2 + 3k + 1 = 2026

3k^2 + 3k - 2025 = 0

Divide by 3: k^2 + k - 675 = 0

k = [-1 ± √(1 + 2700)] / 2 = [-1 ± √2701]/2

√2701: 52^2=2704, 51^2=2601, 2704 - 2701=3, so √2701 ≈ 51.97

So k ≈ [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.485

So k=25 or k=26?

T(25) = 3*(25)^2 + 3*25 + 1 = 3*625 + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951

1951 < 2026

T(26) = 3*(26)^2 + 3*26 + 1 = 3*676 + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2028? 3*676=2028? 600*3=1800, 76*3=228, total 1800+228=2028, yes. Then +78=2106? No:

T(k) = 3k^2 + 3k + 1

So T(26) = 3*(676) + 3*26 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107? 2028 + 78 = 2106, +1=2107.

But 1951 < 2026 < 2107, so yes, k=26? T(25)=1951, T(26)=2107, and 1951 < 2026 ≤ 2107? 2026 ≤ 2107 yes, but is 2026 in ring 26?

Ring k starts at T(k-1) + 1 and ends at T(k).

So ring k starts at T(k-1) + 1.

For k=26, starts at T(25) + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952

Ends at T(26) = 2107

2026 is between 1952 and 2107, so yes, it's in ring 26.

Ring number k=26.

Now, the ring has 6k = 6*26 = 156 cells.

The first cell in the ring is at position T(k-1) + 1 = 1952.

So the numbers in ring 26 range from 1952 to 2107.

2026 is in this ring, so its position in the ring is p = 2026 - 1951 = 2026 - (T(25)) = 2026 - 1951 = 75.

T(25)=1951, so first cell of ring 26 is 1952, so the index in the ring: let s = number - start + 1 = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75? 2026 - 1952 = 74, so position p = 74? Since first cell is position 1.

Set the first cell of the ring as index 1.

So for number n, in ring k, index i = n - T(k-1)

T(k-1) is the last number of previous ring, so n - T(k-1) is the position in the ring, starting from 1.

For n=2026, k=26, T(25)=1951, so i = 2026 - 1951 = 75? 2026 - 1951 = 75, but since T(25) is the last of ring 25, which is 1951, so ring 26 starts at 1952, so i = n - T(k-1) = 2026 - 1951 = 75, but 1952 - 1951 =1, so i=75 means the 75th cell in the ring.

But ring has 156 cells, so i=75.

Now, each ring has 6 sides, and each side has k cells? For ring k, since it has 6k cells, and it's hexagonal, each side has k cells.

In a hexagonal ring, the number of cells per side is equal to the ring number k.

For example, ring 1: k=1, 6 cells, each side has 1 cell? Yes, since it's a hexagon, each side one cell.

Ring 2: k=2, 12 cells, so each side has 2 cells? Yes.

Ring 3: 18 cells, each side 3 cells, etc.

So for ring k, each side has k cells.

The ring is traversed in a spiral, but since it's a ring, we need to know on which side and position the cell is.

Typically, in such spirals, the ring starts at a particular direction.

From the initial diagram, we can see where it starts.

In the snippet, for ring 1: cells 2 to 7.

From the grid: "15 5 1 2 9" and above "14 4 3 10" etc.

Center is 1.

Ring 1: neighbors: should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the row with 1: left is 5, right is 2.

Above: the row above has 4 and 3? "14 4 3 10", so probably above 1 is 4? Or 3?

Likely, directly above is one of them.

Assume that the spiral starts by moving east from 1 to 2.

Then, since it's a spiral, after placing 2, it might turn to another direction.

In hexagonal grid, when moving, you turn 60 degrees.

Typically, for clockwise spiral, it might turn left or right.

From the numbers: after 1 is 2 (east), then next should be 3.

In the diagram, above 2 is 9? But 9 is larger, so probably not adjacent.

The sequence: after 1,2, then 3 is in the top row.

In "14 4 3 10", so 3 and 4 are above.

Probably, from 2, it goes northwest to 3, then west to 4, then southwest to 5, etc.

Let me list the neighbors of 1.

From the grid: the cells adjacent to 1.

Looking at "15 5 1 2 9" — so left is 5, right is 2.

Now, above: the row above is offset; in hex grid, above row might be shifted.

Typically, in even rows or something.

From the numbers: 1 is surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the diagram: directly above 1: if we look, above 1 should be a cell. In the row above, it has 4 and 3, so probably 4 is directly above, or 3.

Assume that north is up.

In "14 4 3 10", and below "15 5 1 2 9", so relative to 1, the cell north might be the one above it.

In standard hex grid, each cell has neighbors in six directions: N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW, or something.

To avoid confusion, let's list the coordinates.

Set center 1 at (0,0).

Then, typically, the six neighbors are at (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) or something, depending on axial coordinates.

Use axial coordinates with q and r.

Set center at (0,0).

Neighbors: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) — but sum should be 0 for axial.

Standard axial: neighbors at (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) — sum q+r=0? No.

In axial coordinates, each neighbor is a step in one direction.

Directions: let's define:

- East: (1,0)

- Northeast: (0,1)

- Northwest: (-1,1)

- West: (-1,0)

- Southwest: (0,-1)

- Southeast: (1,-1)

Sum of q and r is not constant, but that's fine.

Now, for cell (q,r), neighbors are at (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)? Let's see.

From (q,r):

- East: (q+1, r)

- Northeast: if we define as q same, r increase? But in hex, moving northeast changes both.

Standard: the six neighbors are:

(q+1, r), (q, r+1), (q-1, r+1), (q-1, r), (q, r-1), (q+1, r-1)

And q + r is not constant.

Now, the spiral starts at (0,0) =1.

Then, it moves to east: (1,0) =2.

Then, from there, it might move to northeast or southeast.

In the diagram, after 2, what is next? Probably 3.

In the top row, we have 3 and 4.

Suppose from (1,0), it moves to (1,1) or (0,1).

(0,1) would be north of center, but center is (0,0), so (0,1) is north.

In the row above, we have cells like (0,1), (1,1), etc.

In "14 4 3 10", and center row "15 5 1 2 9".

Assume center row is r=0, then above row r=1, below r=-1.

For r=0: cells at q= ..., -2,-1,0,1,2,...

From diagram: q= -2? 15 is left, then 5,1,2,9 so probably q= -2:15? But 15 is large, so not in ring 1.

For ring 1, only immediate neighbors.

At r=0: we have 5,1,2. So probably q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2.

Then above, r=1: cells at q=0,1? Since offset.

In hex grid, for even r or odd, but typically, rows are offset.

In row r=1, cells at q= -0.5? No, integer q.

Standard: for row r, q ranges, and adjacent rows have same q or shifted.

From center (0,0), north neighbor should be (0,1).

In diagram, above 1 is? The cell directly above. In "14 4 3 10", and it's above, so likely above 1 is 4 or 3.

Suppose (0,1) is 4.

Then northeast of (0,0) is (1,1), which might be 3 or something.

But in diagram, to the right of 1 is 2 at (1,0), so northeast of 1 is (1,1).

In the top row, after 3 is 10, but 10 is larger, so probably not.

Perhaps (0,1) is 3, (1,1) is 4.

Let's see the sequence.

After 1 is 2 at (1,0).

Then next number 3 should be adjacent to 2.

Adjacent to 2: (1,0) has neighbors (2,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (2,-1)? From earlier list.

(0,0) is 1, already filled, so it can go to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1), etc.

In the diagram, below is "16 6 7 8", so probably south is filled later.

Above, in top row, we have 3 and 4, so likely it goes up.

Suppose it goes to (1,1) or (0,1).

Assume it goes to (0,1) =3.

Then from there, it might go to (-1,1) or (0,2), but ring 1 should be close.

From 3 at (0,1), it can go to (-1,1) =4, then to (-1,0) =5, then to (0,-1) =6, then to (1,-1) =7, then back.

In the diagram, at r=0, q=-1 is 5, which is west of 1.

At r=1, q=0 is 3, q=-1 is 4? But in diagram, "14 4 3 10", so from left: 14,4,3,10, so probably q for r=1: say q= -2:14, q=-1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10.

But for ring 1, only up to q= -1,0,1? But 14 and 10 are larger, so not in ring 1.

So for ring 1: at (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7, and (1,0):2.

But (1,0) is already 2, and (0,0) is 1.

So the six neighbors are: east (1,0):2, northeast (1,1)? No, according to this, northeast of (0,0) is (1,1), but we have (0,1):3 which is north, and (-1,1):4 northwest, etc.

From (0,0):

- East: (1,0):2

- North: (0,1):3

- Northwest: (-1,1):4

- West: (-1,0):5

- Southwest: (0,-1):6

- Southeast: (1,-1):7

Yes, that makes sense.

In the diagram: center row r=0: q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2

Row above r=1: q= -1:4, q=0:3? But in diagram it's "14 4 3 10", so if q= -1:4, q=0:3, then q=1:10, but 10 is not in ring 1, so for ring 1 only q= -1 and 0 for r=1.

Similarly, row below r= -1: "16 6 7 8", so probably q= -1:6? q=0:7, q=1:8, but 16 is large.

So at r= -1: q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8? But southwest of center is (0,-1):6, southeast is (1,-1):7? But (1,-1) should be southeast, but if r= -1, q=1, that might be southeast.

But we have two cells: (0,-1) and (1,-1).

In diagram, it shows "16 6 7 8", so likely q= -2:16? q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8.

So for ring 1: at r=1: q= -1:4, q=0:3? But earlier I said north is (0,1):3, but if r=1, q=0 is (0,1), which I called north, but in diagram it's labeled 3? But in my assignment I have north as 3, northwest as 4.

In "14 4 3 10", so if q= -1:4, q=0:3, so ( -1,1):4, (0,1):3.

But typically, northwest would be (-1,1), north is (0,1), so yes.

But in the sequence, after 1 is 2, then 3, so 3 is at (0,1), north.

Then next should be 4, which is at (-1,1), northwest.

Then next 5 at (-1,0), west.

Then 6 at (0,-1), southwest.

Then 7 at (1,-1), southeast.

Then back, but ring 1 is complete.

In the spiral, after placing 7, it might move to next ring or something, but ring 1 is done.

Now, the direction: from 1 to 2 (east), then from 2 to 3: from (1,0) to (0,1), which is northwest? From (1,0) to (0,1): delta q= -1, delta r=1, which is northwest direction.

In terms of movement, from cell (1,0), moving to (0,1) is northwest.

But in the spiral path, it might be turning.

After 3 at (0,1), it moves to 4 at (-1,1), which is west? Delta q= -1, delta r=0, so west.

Then to 5 at (-1,0), southwest? Delta q=0, delta r= -1, south? From (-1,1) to (-1,0): delta r= -1, delta q=0, so south.

Then to 6 at (0,-1), southeast? Delta q=1, delta r= -1, southeast? From (-1,0) to (0,-1): delta q=1, delta r= -1, which is southeast.

Then to 7 at (1,-1), east? Delta q=1, delta r=0, east.

Then from 7, it should go to next ring, probably to (2,-1) or something.

In diagram, next is 8, which is at r= -1, q=1:8, but (1,-1) is 7, so east would be (2,-1), but in diagram below row has q=1:8, but if (1,-1) is 7, east is (2,-1), which might be 8? But in diagram "16 6 7 8", so q= -1:6, q=0:7, q=1:8, so (1,-1):7? Earlier I said (1,-1):7, but (1,-1) is southeast of center.

(1,-1) has q=1,r=-1.

East of it is (2,-1), which should be 8? But in diagram, at r=-1, q=1 is 8, so yes, (2,-1):8? q=1,r=-1 is already 7? Confusion.

Coordinates: center (0,0).

(1,0):2 east

(0,1):3 north

(-1,1):4 northwest

(-1,0):5 west

(0,-1):6 southwest? Or south? Earlier I said southwest, but let's define.

From (0,0):

- (1,0): east

- (0,1): north

- (-1,1): northwest

- (-1,0): west

- (0,-1): south? Or southwest? In some systems, it's south.

But (1,-1) is southeast.

In this case, (0,-1) is directly south, since r decreased by 1, q same.

Similarly, (1,-1) is southeast.

In the cell at (1,-1):7

Its neighbors include (2,-1), (1,0), (1,-2), etc.

In diagram, at r=-1, we have cells: q= -1:6? Earlier I said (0,-1):6, which is q=0,r=-1? No.

I think I messed up the coordinates.

Set:

For a cell at (q,r):

- East: (q+1, r)

- North: (q, r+1) ? But in hex, moving north increases r by 1, q same? But then distance might not be 1.

In axial coordinates, the distance between (q1,r1) and (q2,r2) is max(|dq|, |dr|, |dq+dr|) or something, but standard is that neighbors have |dq| ≤1, |dr|≤1, |dq+dr|≤1? Actually in axial, the difference should satisfy |dq| + |dr| + |ds| = 2 where s= -q-r, but it's messy.

To simplify, from the diagram, let's list the positions for small numbers.

Cell 1: (0,0)

Cell 2: east, so (1,0)

Cell 3: from 2, it went to (0,1)? But (0,1) is not adjacent to (1,0)? Are they adjacent?

Distance between (1,0) and (0,1): dq= -1, dr=1, ds= - (q+r) change, but in hex grid, the distance is |dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr| /2 or something. Standard hex distance is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 where s= -q-r, but dq= -1, dr=1, ds= - ( -1 +1) =0, so | -1| + |1| + |0| =2, divided by 2 is 1, so yes, adjacent.

Similarly, (0,1) and (-1,1): dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, | -1| + |0| + |1| =2, dist 1.

(-1,1) and (-1,0): dq=0, dr= -1, ds=1, |0|+| -1|+|1|=2, dist 1.

(-1,0) and (0,-1): dq=1, dr= -1, ds=0, |1|+|-1|+|0|=2, dist 1.

(0,-1) and (1,-1): dq=1, dr=0, ds= -1, |1|+|0|+|-1|=2, dist 1.

(1,-1) and (1,0): dq=0, dr=1, ds= -1, |0|+|1|+|-1|=2, dist 1.

And (1,0) and (0,0): dq= -1, dr=0, ds=1, dist 1.

So yes, all adjacent.

Now, in the spiral, after 7 at (1,-1), it goes to 8. Where is 8? In diagram, at r= -1, q=1:8, but (1,-1) is already 7, so next is probably (2,-1) or (2,0) or (1,0) but occupied.

From (1,-1), it can go to (2,-1) east, or (2,0) northeast, or (1,0) north, but (1,0) is occupied by 2, so likely it goes to (2,-1) or (2,0).

In diagram, below row has "16 6 7 8", and 6 is at q= -1, r= -1? Earlier I assumed (0,-1):6, but if r= -1, q=0:6? But in diagram, it's "16 6 7 8", so if q= -1:16? q=0:6? q=1:7? q=2:8? But 7 is at (1,-1), so if q=1:7, then q=2:8, so (2,-1):8.

Yes, so from 7 at (1,-1) to 8 at (2,-1), east.

Then next 9 at (2,0)? In diagram, in the center row, after 2 is 9, and q=2:9? Center row is "15 5 1 2 9", so q= -2:15? q= -1:5, q=0:1, q=1:2, q=2:9.

So (2,0):9.

From (2,-1) to (2,0): delta q=0, delta r=1, north.

Then next 10 at (1,1)? Or (2,1).

In top row r=1: "14 4 3 10", so q= -2:14? q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10.

So (1,1):10? Since (0,1):3, ( -1,1):4, so (1,1) should be there.

From (2,0) to (1,1): delta q= -1, delta r=1, northwest.

And so on.

So the spiral path is: start at (0,0):1

Move east to (1,0):2

Then northwest to (0,1):3? From (1,0) to (0,1): as we said, adjacent.

Then west to (-1,1):4

Then south to (-1,0):5

Then southeast to (0,-1):6? From (-1,0) to (0,-1): delta q=1, dr= -1, which is southeast.

Then east to (1,-1):7

Then east to (2,-1):8

Then north to (2,0):9

Then northwest to (1,1):10? From (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest.

Then west to (0,1)? But (0,1) is occupied by 3.

After 10 at (1,1), it should go to next, probably west to (0,1), but occupied, so it must turn.

In spiral, when it hits an occupied cell, it turns.

From (1,1), neighbors: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)

(0,1) occupied, (1,0) occupied, (0,0) occupied, (2,0) occupied by 9, so only (2,1) and (1,2) free.

It might go to (2,1) east or (1,2) north.

In diagram, top row has q=1:10, and next might be q=2:? But in "14 4 3 10", after 10 is nothing, but probably next row or something.

After 10, it should be 11.

In the sequence, after 10, probably 11 at (2,1) or (1,2).

Later cells: 11,12,etc.

In diagram, we have 14 at q= -2,r=1, which is larger, so ring 2 has more cells.

Ring 2 starts after ring 1, so cell 8 is first of ring 2? Earlier we said ring 0:1, ring 1:2-7, ring 2:8-19.

Cell 8 at (2,-1), 9 at (2,0), 10 at (1,1), then 11 at? Suppose it goes to (0,2) or something.

From (1,1), if it goes north to (1,2), or east to (2,1).

In many spirals, it continues in the same direction or turns.

From the path so far: from 7 to 8: east, 8 to 9: north, 9 to 10: northwest.

Northwest is not a standard direction; it's a combination.

The movement directions: from 1 to 2: east

2 to 3: northwest

3 to 4: west

4 to 5: south

5 to 6: southeast

6 to 7: east

7 to 8: east

8 to 9: north

9 to 10: northwest

Now from 10 at (1,1), it needs to go to next cell. Since it was going northwest, but northwest from (1,1) would be to (0,2), but (0,1) is occupied, but (0,2) might be free.

If it tries to go northwest to (0,2), but is it adjacent? From (1,1) to (0,2): dq= -1, dr=1, same as before, dist 1, yes.

And (0,2) is free.

Then to ( -1,2), etc.

In diagram, at r=2, we have cells, but not shown, but likely.

After 10, it could go to (0,2):11, then to (-1,2):12, then to (-2,1):13? Let's see the numbers.

In the top row, we have 14 at q= -2,r=1, which is (-2,1), and it's 14, so probably later.

For cell 11: if at (0,2), then 12 at (-1,2), then 13 at (-2,2) or (-2,1).

From (-1,2), it can go west to (-2,2), or southwest to (-2,1), etc.

In diagram, at r=1, q= -2:14, which is (-2,1), and it's 14, so for cell 11,12,13, not shown, but likely 11 at (0,2), 12 at (-1,2), 13 at (-2,2), then 14 at (-2,1)? From (-2,2) to (-2,1): south.

Then to (-1,0)? But occupied.

This is getting messy, but for the spiral direction, we can see the pattern for the start of each ring.

For ring k, it starts at a particular direction.

From ring 1: starts at (1,0) for cell 2, which is east of center.

Ring 2: starts at (2,-1) for cell 8, which is southeast of center? (2,-1), q=2,r= -1.

From center (0,0), it's at (2,-1), which is east-southeast.

But in terms of the grid, it's in the southeast direction.

Notice that for ring k, the starting cell is at (k, -k+1) or something.

For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (2,-1)

k=3: probably (3,-2) or (3,-1), but let's see.

Cell for ring 3: starts at T(2)+1 =19+1=20? T(2)=19, so ring 3 starts at 20.

Where is it? From the spiral, after ring 2 ends, but we don't have diagram, but from pattern, after ring 2, it might start at (3,-2) or something.

From the movement: after cell 19, which is last of ring 2, it goes to cell 20, which is the first of ring 3.

In general, for a hexagonal spiral, the start of ring k is at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

k=2: (2,-1) = (2,1-2)? 1-2= -1, yes.

k=3: should be (3,1-3)=(3,-2)

Then the direction it moves first is east, same as ring 1 and 2.

Ring 1: from start (1,0) to next: but ring 1 has only one cell per side? For ring k, it starts and moves in a direction.

In ring k, the first cell is at (k, 1-k), and it moves east for the first side.

Each side has k cells.

The sides are in order: for example, in ring 1: only one cell per "side", but since k=1, each side has one cell.

The order of traversal: for ring k, it traverses the sides in order: first east side, then northwest, then west, then southwest, then south, then southeast, or something.

From the initial movement:

For ring k=1:

Start at (1,0): cell 2

Then moves to (0,1): cell 3 — this is northwest direction? From (1,0) to (0,1): as we said, northwest.

But in terms of the side, it's moving to the next cell in the ring.

Since each "side" has only one cell, it's just moving to the next vertex.

For larger k, each side has k cells, and it moves along the side.

In ring k, it starts at the "southeast" corner or something.

Standard for hexagonal spiral: often it starts at the easternmost point of the southern side or something.

From our earlier:

For ring k=2: starts at (2,-1): cell 8

Then moves north to (2,0): cell 9 — this is north direction.

Then moves northwest to (1,1): cell 10 — northwest.

Then from there, it should move west along the top side.

After (1,1), it went to (0,2)? But for k=2, each side has 2 cells.

The northwest side might be from (2,0) to (1,1)? But that's only one move.

From start (2,-1), first move north to (2,0): cell 9.

Then next move northwest to (1,1): cell 10.

Now, for the northwest side, it should have two cells, but only one so far? Perhaps (1,1) is the first cell of the next side.

After (1,1), it should move west to (0,1), but (0,1) is occupied by cell 3, which is in ring 1.

So it can't go there. Instead, it must go to the next available, which is (0,2) or (1,2).

In our earlier assumption, it went to (0,2):11.

Then to (-1,2):12.

Then from there, it should move southwest or west.

After (-1,2), it could go to (-2,2) or (-2,1).

If it goes to (-2,2):13, then to (-2,1):14, as in diagram.

Then to (-2,0):15? In diagram, center row has q= -2:15, r=0, so (-2,0):15.

Then to (-1,-1):16? In below row "16 6 7 8", so r= -1, q= -1:6? But 6 is cell 6, already placed, so for new cells, at r= -1, q= -2:16? So (-2,-1):16.

Then to (-1,-2):17? And so on.

So for ring 2:

Cell 8: (2,-1)

9: (2,0)

10: (1,1)

11: (0,2)? But (0,2) is not on the same "side".

The cells: 8:(2,-1), 9:(2,0), 10:(1,1), 11:(0,2), 12:(-1,2), 13:(-2,2), 14:(-2,1), 15:(-2,0), 16:(-2,-1), 17:(-1,-2), 18:(0,-2), 19:(1,-2), 20:(2,-2)? But ring 2 has 12 cells, so up to 19.

After 14 at (-2,1), then 15 at (-2,0), then 16 at (-2,-1), then 17 at (-1,-2)? From (-2,-1) to (-1,-2): delta q=1, dr= -1, southeast.

Then to (0,-2):18, then to (1,-2):19.

Then next ring starts at (3,-2) or something.

Now, the sides: for ring k=2, the cells are on the perimeter.

The starting point (2,-1) is the southeast corner? Or what.

Typically, the first cell is at the "east" of the previous start, but for k=2, start at (2,-1), while for k=1, start at (1,0).

The direction of movement for each side.

In ring k, it moves along six sides, each with k cells, in six directions.

From the start, it moves in a certain direction for k steps.

For example, in ring 1: start at (1,0), then moves to (0,1) — this is one step, but since k=1, only one cell per side, and it moves in northwest direction for this "side".

But in ring 1, after start, it moves to the next cell in northwest dir, but only one cell for that "side".

For larger k, it moves in a straight line for k cells in a particular direction.

In ring k=2:

Start at (2,-1): cell 8

Then it moves north to (2,0): cell 9 — so direction north for 2 cells? But only moved one step so far.

After cell 9, it moves to cell 10 at (1,1), which is northwest from (2,0).

So not the same direction.

Perhaps it moves in different directions for each cell, but that's not efficient.

From the path, it seems that for each "side", it moves in a constant direction for several cells, but in this case for k=2, on the first side, from (2,-1) to (2,0), direction north, but only one cell moved, but there should be two cells on the side.

Cell 8 and 9 are both on the "east" side or something.

Cell 8:(2,-1), cell 9:(2,0), both have q=2, so along the line q=2.

Then next cell 10:(1,1), which is different.

So the first two cells are at (2,-1) and (2,0), so along the north direction? From (2,-1) to (2,0) is north.

Then from (2,0) to (1,1) is northwest.

Then from (1,1) to (0,2) is west? dq= -1, dr=0, west.

From (0,2) to (-1,2) is west, dq= -1, dr=0.

So for the third cell of the ring, it moves west for two cells: from (1,1) to (0,2) to (-1,2), cells 10,11,12? Cell 10:(1,1), 11:(0,2), 12:(-1,2), so yes, from cell 10 to 12, moving west.

Then from (-1,2) to (-2,2): west again? But then to (-2,1): south, dq=0, dr= -1.

Cell 13:(-2,2), cell 14:(-2,1), so from 13 to 14, south.

Then to (-2,0): south, cell 15:(-2,0)

Then to (-2,-1): south? But cell 16:(-2,-1), so yes, south for three cells? But k=2, should be two cells per side.

Cell 14,15,16 are at (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), so q= -2, r from 1 to -1, so along q= -2, direction south.

But there are three cells: 14,15,16, but ring has only 12 cells, and we have cell 8 to 19, so 12 cells.

After cell 12:(-1,2), then 13:(-2,2), 14:(-2,1), 15:(-2,0), 16:(-2,-1), that's five cells already, but we have only up to cell 19, so probably not.

Earlier I said cell 13:(-2,2), but in diagram at r=2, q= -2:14? "14 4 3 10" but 14 is at q= -2,r=1? Confusion.

In the top row r=1: "14 4 3 10", so cells at r=1: q= -2:14, q= -1:4, q=0:3, q=1:10.

Cell 4 is at (-1,1), cell 3 at (0,1), cell 10 at (1,1), cell 14 at (-2,1).

Cell 14 is in ring 2, since ring 2 is 8 to 19.

So at (-2,1):14.

Now, what is cell 11,12,13? Not shown, but likely.

From cell 10 at (1,1):10, then next 11 at (0,2)? But r=2, q=0.

Then 12 at (-1,2):12, then 13 at (-2,2):13, then 14 at (-2,1):14, as given.

Then 15 at (-2,0):15, as in center row q= -2:15.

Then 16 at (-2,-1):16, in below row r= -1, q= -2:16.

Then 17 at (-1,-2):17? r= -2, q= -1.

Then 18 at (0,-2):18, r= -2, q=0.

Then 19 at (1,-2):19, r= -2, q=1.

Then ring 3 starts at (2,-2) or (3,-2), etc.

So for ring 2: cells in order:

8: (2,-1)

9: (2,0)

10: (1,1)

11: (0,2)

12: (-1,2)

13: (-2,2)

14: (-2,1)

15: (-2,0)

16: (-2,-1)

17: (-1,-2)

18: (0,-2)

19: (1,-2)

Now, the directions between cells:

From 8 to 9: (2,-1) to (2,0): delta r=1, dq=0, north

9 to 10: (2,0) to (1,1): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest

10 to 11: (1,1) to (0,2): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest? Same as previous? But from (1,1) to (0,2): dq= -1, dr=1, yes northwest.

11 to 12: (0,2) to (-1,2): dq= -1, dr=0, west

12 to 13: (-1,2) to (-2,2): dq= -1, dr=0, west

13 to 14: (-2,2) to (-2,1): dq=0, dr= -1, south

14 to 15: (-2,1) to (-2,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south

15 to 16: (-2,0) to (-2,-1): dq=0, dr= -1, south

16 to 17: (-2,-1) to (-1,-2): dq=1, dr= -1, southeast

17 to 18: (-1,-2) to (0,-2): dq=1, dr=0, east

18 to 19: (0,-2) to (1,-2): dq=1, dr=0, east

Then to next.

So the directions are not constant for the side; it changes.

For the side, the cells are grouped, but the movement is not in a straight line for the entire side.

For example, cells 8 and 9 are both with q=2, r from -1 to 0, so along the line q=2, direction north.

Then cells 10,11,12: (1,1),(0,2),(-1,2), which have r=2, q from 1 to -1, so along r=2, direction west.

Then cells 13,14,15,16: (-2,2),(-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1), along q= -2, direction south.

But there are 4 cells, while for k=2, should be 2 per side.

Cells 17,18,19: (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2), along r= -2, direction east.

But again 3 cells.

This is not consistent.

Perhaps the "sides" are not aligned with the grid lines.

For the purpose of finding neighbors, I may not need the exact path, but rather the position of the cell in the ring.

For a cell in ring k, with index i (1 to 6k), its coordinates can be determined, and then its neighbors can be found.

Since the grid is hexagonal, the neighbors depend only on the coordinates, not on the spiral order.

To find the neighbors of a cell, I need its (q,r) coordinates, then the six adjacent cells are (q±1,r), (q,r±1), (q±1,r∓1), but specifically:

As earlier, the six neighbors are:

(q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)

Yes.

And for a cell on the ring, its neighbors may be in the same ring, previous ring, or next ring.

For the number 2026, which is in ring k=26, with index i=75.

First, find its (q,r) coordinates.

For a cell in ring k, the coordinates can be found based on which side it is on and its position on the side.

From the start of the ring.

For ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k)

For k=1: (1,0) = (1,1-1)

k=2: (2,-1) = (2,1-2)

k=3: (3,-2) = (3,1-3)

Yes.

Then, it moves in certain directions for each segment of the ring.

From the ring 2 example, the first "segment" is from (2,-1) to (2,0): so moving north for 1 cell? But for k=2, it should move for k cells in some direction, but here only one cell in north direction.

In ring 2, from start to cell 9: from (2,-1) to (2,0), north, but only one cell, whereas for the first side, there should be k=2 cells.

Cells 8 and 9 are both on the first side, and they are at (2,-1) and (2,0), so the side is along q=2, from r= -1 to r=0, but only two points, so it's a vertical side.

The direction of movement is north for this side.

From cell 8 to cell 9: moved north.

Then from cell 9 to cell 10: moved northwest to (1,1).

But cell 10 is on the next side.

The sides are between the vertices.

In a hexagon, the sides are straight, so for ring k, the cells on a side are collinear in one of the six directions.

For example, in direction "east", cells with constant r, q varying.

In our case, for the first side of ring k, it is in the "north" direction, cells with constant q=k, r from 1-k to 0 or something.

For k=2, q=2, r from -1 to 0.

r = -1 and 0.

The range of r: from 1-k =1-2= -1 to 0, so r = -1,0, two cells.

And it is moving north, so for this side, cells have q=k, r = 1-k, 2-k, ..., 0? For k=2, r= -1,0.

General: for the first side (east side? ), cells have q=k, r = s for s = 1-k to 0, so k cells? s from 1-k to 0 inclusive, number of cells: 0 - (1-k) +1 = k, yes.

For k=2, r= -1,0.

Cell 8: r= -1, cell 9: r=0.

Then the next side is in northwest direction.

Cells 10,11,12: (1,1),(0,2),(-1,2)

What is constant? r - q? Or something.

From (1,1) to (0,2) to (-1,2), so r is not constant, q is not constant.

Notice that r + q = 2 for cell 10:1+1=2, cell 11:0+2=2, cell 12: -1+2=1? Not constant.

r - q: 1-1=0, 2-0=2, 2-(-1)=3, not constant.

The sum s = q + r: cell 10:2, cell 11:2, cell 12:1? Cell 12: (-1,2), q+ r=1.

Not constant.

The difference.

In hex grid, the lines are defined by q= constant, r= constant, or q+r= constant.

For example, northwest-southeast lines have q+ r = constant.

Cell 10: (1,1), q+r=2

Cell 11: (0,2), q+r=2

Cell 12: (-1,2), q+r=1, not same.

Cell 13: (-2,2), q+r=0.

So not on the same line.

Perhaps for the second side, it is along a different direction.

From cell 9 at (2,0), it moved to cell 10 at (1,1), which is northwest, then to cell 11 at (0,2), northwest, then to cell 12 at (-1,2), west.

So not consistent.

Perhaps the side starts after the corner.

In ring k, there are 6 corners, and between corners, there are (k-1) cells if k>1, but for k=1, no cells between, only corners.

For k=2, there are 6 corners, and no cells between, since 6*1 =6, but ring 2 has 12 cells, so there are cells between corners.

For ring k, there are 6 corners, and on each side between corners, there are (k-1) cells, so total cells 6k, with 6 corners and 6*(k-1) edge cells, but 6 + 6(k-1) = 6k, yes.

The corners are at the vertices of the hexagon.

For ring k, the corners are at (k,0), (k,k), (0,k), (-k,k), (-k,0), (0,-k), or something.

For k=1: corners at (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1) — but these are exactly the six cells, since no edge cells.

For k=2: corners should be at, say, (2,0), (2,2), (0,2), (-2,2), (-2,0), (0,-2) — but (2,2) is not in our list; our cells are at r from -1 to 2, but (2,2) is not there.

In our list for ring 2: cells at q=2 r= -1,0; q=1 r=1; q=0 r=2; q= -1 r=2; q= -2 r=2,1,0,-1; q= -1 r= -2; q=0 r= -2; q=1 r= -2.

So the "corners" might be at (2,0), (0,2), (-2,2), (-2,0), (0,-2), (2,-2)? But (2,-2) is not in ring 2; in our list, at q=2, r= -1 and 0, not -2.

Perhaps (2,0), (1,1), (-1,2), (-2,1), (-2,-1), (1,-2) or something.

From the start, cell 8:(2,-1) is not a corner, cell 9:(2,0) is a corner, cell 10:(1,1) is not, cell 11:(0,2) is not, cell 12:(-1,2) is not, cell 13:(-2,2) is a corner, cell 14:(-2,1) is not, cell 15:(-2,0) is a corner, cell 16:(-2,-1) is not, cell 17:(-1,-2) is not, cell 18:(0,-2) is not, cell 19:(1,-2) is a corner.

So corners at i=9:(2,0), i=13:(-2,2), i=15:(-2,0), i=19:(1,-2) — not symmetric.

This is messy.

Perhaps for the purpose of finding coordinates, I can use the fact that for a given i in ring k, the side can be determined.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

The sides are traversed in order: for example, first side: east or north, etc.

From the start, for ring k, it starts at (k,1-k)

Then for the first side, it moves in the "north" direction for k cells.

For k=2: from (2,-1) , move north: to (2,-1+1)=(2,0), so cells at (2,-1) and (2,0), which matches cell 8 and 9.

For k=1: from (1,0), move north: to (1,0+1)=(1,1), but in ring 1, after start at (1,0), it moved to (0,1), not (1,1). So not consistent.

For k=1, it's special.

For k≥2, it might work, but for k=1 it's different.

In ring 1, it has only one cell per "side", but the movement is not in the same direction as larger rings.

To make it consistent, perhaps the first move is always north for the first side.

For k=1: start at (1,0), move north to (1,1)? But in reality, it went to (0,1), which is not north from (1,0); north from (1,0) is (1,1).

But in our case, it went to (0,1), which is northwest.

So perhaps the first side is in northwest direction for all k.

For k=1: from (1,0) to (0,1): northwest.

For k=2: from (2,-1) to ? If northwest, to (1,0), but (1,0) is occupied by cell 2, so it can't go there. In ring 2, it went to (2,0), which is north, not northwest.

So not.

Perhaps for each ring, the first cell is at (k,1-k), and the first side is in the "north" direction, but for k=1, north from (1,0) is (1,1), but it went to (0,1), so perhaps it's not.

Another way: in many sources, for a hexagonal spiral, the coordinates can be calculated using the ring number and the sector.

Let me define the side number.

The 6 sides are indexed from 0 to 5.

Side 0: east side, cells with high q, r varying.

Side 1: northwest side, cells with high r, q varying or something.

From the start of the ring at (k,1-k)

Then for side 0: cells with q=k, r = 1-k, 2-k, ..., 0  (r increasing)

Number of cells: from r=1-k to r=0, which is k cells, as in k=2: r= -1,0.

Then side 1: after that, it should go to the next side.

In k=2, after cell 9 at (2,0), it went to (1,1), which is not on q=k.

For side 1, it might be cells with r = k, q = k, k-1, ..., 1 or something.

For k=2, r=2, q from 2 down to 1? But cell 10 at (1,1), r=1 not 2.

Cell 11 at (0,2), r=2, cell 12 at (-1,2), r=2, so for r=2, q from 0 down to -1, but not from k=2.

Perhaps for side 1, cells with q + r = k+1 or something.

For cell 10: (1,1), q+r=2

Cell 11: (0,2), q+r=2

Cell 12: (-1,2), q+ r=1, not same.

After the first side, the next cell is at the start of the next side.

In k=2, after cell 9 at (2,0), it moves to cell 10 at (1,1), which is the first cell of the northwest side.

Then for this side, it moves west for k cells? But in this case, it moved to (0,2) and (-1,2), so in west direction for some cells.

From cell 10 to 11: (1,1) to (0,2): northwest

11 to 12: (0,2) to (-1,2): west

 not constant.

Perhaps the sides are not aligned, but for the coordinate calculation, I can use the following method.

For a cell in ring k, with index i (1 to 6k), the side s = floor((i-1)/k) , which gives 0 to 5, since 6k/k=6, so s = 0,1,2,3,4,5 for each group of k cells.

Then within the side, the position t = (i-1) mod k, from 0 to k-1.

Then for each side, the coordinates can be given.

From the start of the ring at (k,1-k)

For side s=0: the first cell is at (k,1-k)

Then as t increases, it moves in a direction.

For s=0, in k=2, cells i=1,2: i=1: cell 8:(2,-1), i=2: cell 9:(2,0)

So as t from 0 to 1, r increases from -1 to 0, q constant.

So it moves north: dr=1, dq=0.

For s=1: i=3,4: cell 10:(1,1), cell 11:(0,2)? i=3: cell 10, i=4: cell 11.

Cell 10:(1,1), cell 11:(0,2)

From t=0 to t=1, from (1,1) to (0,2): dq= -1, dr=1, northwest.

For s=2: i=5,6: cell 12:(-1,2), cell 13:(-2,2)

From t=0 to t=1, from (-1,2) to (-2,2): dq= -1, dr=0, west.

For s=3: i=7,8: cell 14:(-2,1), cell 15:(-2,0)

From (-2,1) to (-2,0): dq=0, dr= -1, south.

s=4: i=9,10: cell 16:(-2,-1), cell 17:(-1,-2)

From (-2,-1) to (-1,-2): dq=1, dr= -1, southeast.

s=5: i=11,12: cell 18:(0,-2), cell 19:(1,-2)

From (0,-2) to (1,-2): dq=1, dr=0, east.

Now for general k, the movement for each side s:

s=0: move north: dq=0, dr=1

s=1: move northwest: dq= -1, dr=1

s=2: move west: dq= -1, dr=0

s=3: move south: dq=0, dr= -1

s=4: move southeast: dq=1, dr= -1

s=5: move east: dq=1, dr=0

The start of each side is at a point, and as t increases, it moves in that direction for k steps, but since it's discrete, for each t, it moves one step in that direction from the start.

For side s, the start point is given, and then for t=0 to k-1, the cell is at start + t * direction.

For s=0, start at (k,1-k), direction (0,1), so cell at (k, 1-k + t)

For t=0: (k,1-k), t=1: (k,2-k), ..., t=k-1: (k,1-k + k-1) = (k,0)

For k=2: (2,-1) for t=0, (2,0) for t=1, yes.

For s=1, what is the start point? After s=0, the last cell is at (k,0)

Then for s=1, it should start at the next cell, which for k=2 is (1,1)

From (k,0) to (1,1): not adjacent if k>1, but in movement, after (k,0), it moves to the first cell of s=1, which is not necessarily adjacent if k>1, but in the spiral, it is adjacent by the movement.

For s=1, in k=2, start at (1,1), which is not adjacent to (2,0), but in the grid, (2,0) and (1,1) are adjacent, as dq= -1, dr=1, dist 1.

And for s=1, direction northwest: dq= -1, dr=1, so cell at start + t * (-1,1)

For t=0: (1,1), t=1: (1-1,1+1)=(0,2)

For k=2, t=0,1, so cells at (1,1), (0,2), which matches cell 10,11.

But cell 12 is at (-1,2), which is not included; for s=1, only two cells, but in our list, cell 12 is i=5, which is s=2 since i=5, s= floor((5-1)/2)=floor(4/2)=2, so s=2.

For s=1, only i=3,4 for k=2, cells 10 and 11.

Cell 12 is i=5, s=2.

For s=2, start at? After s=1, last cell at (0,2) for k=2.

Then s=2 start at (-1,2)? Which is not adjacent, but in grid, (0,2) to (-1,2) is adjacent, dq= -1, dr=0.

Direction for s=2 is west: dq= -1, dr=0, so cell at start + t * (-1,0)

For t=0: (-1,2), t=1: (-2,2), which matches cell 12,13.

Then s=3: start at? After (-2,2), for s=3, in k=2, cell 14:(-2,1), cell 15:(-2,0)

So start at (-2,1)? But from (-2,2) to (-2,1) is south, dq=0, dr= -1.

Direction south: dq=0, dr= -1.

But for t=0: (-2,1), t=1: (-2,0)

But in the sequence, after cell 13 at (-2,2), it goes to cell 14 at (-2,1), which is south, so start of s=3 is (-2,1)

But how to get from end of s=2 to start of s=3? From (-2,2) to (-2,1), which is one step south, but in the side definition, it's part of the side or not.

In this case, for s=3, cells are at (-2,1), (-2,0), so for t=0,1.

But the end of s=2 is at (-2,2), and start of s=3 is at (-2,1), so it's adjacent, and the move from end of s=2 to start of s=3 is in the direction of s=3, south.

Similarly for others.

In general, after each side, it moves to the start of the next side by moving in the direction of the next side for one step, but since the start of the next side is included in the next side, it's fine.

To find the start of each side.

The start of the ring is for s=0, t=0: (k,1-k)

Then after s=0, the last cell is at (k,0) for t=k-1.

Then for s=1, it starts at (k-1,1) ? For k=2, from (2,0) to (1,1), which is dq= -1, dr=1, northwest.

And northwest is the direction for s=1.

Similarly, after s=1, last cell at for k=2, (0,2)

Then for s=2, start at (-1,2), from (0,2) to (-1,2), dq= -1, dr=0, west, which is direction for s=2.

After s=2, last cell at (-2,2)

For s=3, start at (-2,1), from (-2,2) to (-2,1), dq=0, dr= -1, south, direction for s=3.

After s=3, last cell at (-2,0)

For s=4, start at (-1,-1)? For k=2, cell 16:(-2,-1), but start of s=4 is cell 16? i=9 for k=2? i=1 to 12, s= floor((i-1)/2), so s=4 for i=9,10.

Cell i=9: cell 16:(-2,-1)? In our list, cell 16 is i=9? Earlier i is index in ring, cell 8:i=1,9:i=2,10:i=3,11:i=4,12:i=5,13:i=6,14:i=7,15:i=8,16:i=9,17:i=10,18:i=11,19:i=12.

Cell 16: i=9, s= floor((9-1)/2)=floor(8/2)=4, t=0.

Position: (-2,-1)

From end of s=3: cell 15 at (-2,0), to cell 16 at (-2,-1), dq=0, dr= -1, south, but direction for s=4 is southeast, not south.

Problem.

For s=4, direction is southeast: dq=1, dr= -1.

But from (-2,0) to (-2,-1) is south, not southeast.

Then to cell 17: (-1,-2), from (-2,-1) to (-1,-2), dq=1, dr= -1, southeast.

So for s=4, cells are at t=0: (-2,-1), t=1: (-1,-2)

So start at (-2,-1), which is south of end of s=3 at (-2,0).

But the direction for s=4 is southeast, but the first cell is not in that direction from the previous.

The start point for s=4 is at (-2,-1), and then it moves southeast to (-1,-2).

Similarly for others.

To generalize, the start of each side s is at a point that can be calculated.

From the end of previous side, it moves to the start of next side by a move that is not in the side direction, but in this case for s=3 to s=4, it moved south to (-2,-1), but south is the direction of s=3, not s=4.

Perhaps after each side, it makes a "corner" move to the start of the next side, which is in the direction of the next side or something.

For s=3 to s=4: from (-2,0) to (-2,-1), which is south, but s=4 direction is southeast, so not.

Notice that for s=4, start at ( -k, -1 ) for k=2, (-2,-1)

Then for s=5, start at (0,-2) for k=2? Cell 18:(0,-2), i=11, s=5, t=0.

From end of s=4: cell 17:(-1,-2), to cell 18:(0,-2), dq=1, dr=0, east, which is direction for s=5.

Then to cell 19:(1,-2), east.

So for s=5, cells at (0,-2), (1,-2)

Start at (0,-2)

Now to find a general formula for the start of side s.

Let P(s) be the start point for side s.

P(0) = (k, 1-k)

After s=0, last cell is P(0) + (k-1) * dir0 = (k,1-k) + (k-1)*(0,1) = (k,1-k + k-1) = (k,0)

Then P(1) = ? In k=2, P(1) = (1,1)

How to get from (k,0) to (1,1)? It's not a single move; in the grid, it is adjacent, but for general k, from (k,0) to the start of s=1.

In k=2, from (2,0) to (1,1), which is northwest.

For general k, P(1) = (k-1,1)

Then last cell of s=1: P(1) + (k-1) * dir1 = (k-1,1) + (k-1)*(-1,1) = (k-1 - (k-1), 1 + (k-1)) = (0,k)

Then P(2) = ? In k=2, P(2) = (-1,2)

From (0,k) to (-1,2) for k=2, which is west.

General: P(2) = (-1,k)

Then last cell of s=2: P(2) + (k-1)*(-1,0) = (-1,k) + (k-1)*(-1,0) = (-1 - (k-1), k) = (-k,k)

Then P(3) = ? In k=2, P(3) = (-2,1)

From (-k,k) to (-2,1) for k=2, which is south.

General: P(3) = (-k, k-1)? For k=2, (-2,1), yes.

Last cell of s=3: P(3) + (k-1)*(0,-1) = (-k,k-1) + (k-1)*(0,-1) = (-k, k-1 - (k-1)) = (-k,0)

Then P(4) = ? In k=2, (-2,-1)

From (-k,0) to (-2,-1), south for k=2.

General: P(4) = (-k, -1)

Last cell of s=4: P(4) + (k-1)*(1,-1) = (-k,-1) + (k-1)*(1,-1) = (-k + k-1, -1 - (k-1)) = (-1, -k)

Then P(5) = ? In k=2, (0,-2)

From (-1,-k) to (0,-2), east for k=2.

General: P(5) = (0, -k)

Last cell of s=5: P(5) + (k-1)*(1,0) = (0,-k) + (k-1)*(1,0) = (k-1, -k)

Then for the next ring, but we stop.

Now for our cell, in ring k, side s, position t, the cell is at P(s) + t * dir(s)

Where dir(s) as defined:

s=0: (0,1) north

s=1: (-1,1) northwest

s=2: (-1,0) west

s=3: (0,-1) south

s=4: (1,-1) southeast

s=5: (1,0) east

And P(s):

s=0: (k, 1-k)

s=1: (k-1, 1)

s=2: (-1, k)

s=3: (-k, k-1)

s=4: (-k, -1)

s=5: (0, -k)

Now for k=2, let's verify:

s=0: P=(2,1-2)=(2,-1), dir=(0,1), t=0: (2,-1), t=1: (2,0) cells 8,9

s=1: P=(2-1,1)=(1,1), dir=(-1,1), t=0: (1,1), t=1: (0,2) cells 10,11

s=2: P=(-1,2), dir=(-1,0), t=0: (-1,2), t=1: (-2,2) cells 12,13

s=3: P=(-2,2-1)=(-2,1), dir=(0,-1), t=0: (-2,1), t=1: (-2,0) cells 14,15

s=4: P=(-2,-1), dir=(1,-1), t=0: (-2,-1), t=1: (-1,-2) cells 16,17

s=5: P=(0,-2), dir=(1,0), t=0: (0,-2), t=1: (1,-2) cells 18,19

Perfect, matches our earlier list.

Now for k=1, let's check.

Ring k=1, i=1 to 6.

s= floor((i-1)/1) = i-1, so s=0 to 5.

P(s):

s=0: (1,1-1)=(1,0)

dir=(0,1), t=0: (1,0) but t only 0 since k=1.

Cell at (1,0): should be cell 2? But in ring 1, first cell is 2.

But for i=1, s=0,t=0: (1,0): cell 2

s=1: P=(1-1,1)=(0,1), dir=(-1,1), t=0: (0,1): cell 3

s=2: P=(-1,1), dir=(-1,0), t=0: (-1,1): cell 4

s=3: P=(-1,1-1)=(-1,0), dir=(0,-1), t=0: (-1,0): cell 5

s=4: P=(-1,-1), dir=(1,-1), t=0: (-1,-1): cell 6? But in our earlier, southwest is (0,-1), not (-1,-1).

Problem.

For k=1, s=4: P=(-1,-1), but in reality, cell 6 is at (0,-1), not (-1,-1).

And (-1,-1) may not be adjacent.

So for k=1, it doesn't work.

But in ring 1, the cells are at (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):6, (1,-1):7

But according to formula:

s=0: (1,0):2 ok

s=1: (0,1):3 ok

s=2: (-1,1):4 ok

s=3: (-1,0):5 ok

s=4: (-1,-1): but should be (0,-1)

s=5: (0,-1): but should be (1,-1)

So s=4 and s=5 are swapped or something.

For s=4: should be (0,-1), but formula gives (-1,-1)

s=5: should be (1,-1), formula gives (0,-1)

So not correct for k=1.

Since k=1 is small, and our n=2026 is in k=26>1, it might be ok, but for completeness, we can adjust.

Notice that for s=4, P(s)= (-k, -1), but for k=1, (-1,-1), but should be (0,-1)

Similarly for s=5, (0,-k)=(0,-1), but should be (1,-1)

So perhaps for s=4, it should be (-k+1, -k) or something.

In general, the formula might be for k≥1, but s=4 and s=5 need adjustment.

Since for our purpose k=26 is large, and the neighbors will be in the same or adjacent rings, but for cells on the edge, neighbors might be in different rings, but for k>1, the formula should work.

For k=1, we can handle separately, but n=2026 not in k=1.

So for ring k≥1, with the formula, but for k=1 it's wrong, but we'll use it for k≥2.

In our case k=26>1.

So for n=2026, ring k=26, index i=2026 - T(25) = 2026 - 1951 = 75

T(25)=3*25*26 +1? Earlier T(k)=3k(k+1)+1

T(25)=3*25*26 +1=3*650+1=1950+1=1951, yes.

So i = n - T(k-1) = 2026 - 1951 = 75

Ring has 6k=156 cells.

s = floor((i-1)/k) = floor(74/26) since i=75, i-1=74

k=26, 74 / 26 = 2.846..., floor=2? 26*2=52, 26*3=78>74, so floor=2.

s= floor((i-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = 2? Since 26*2=52 ≤74<78=26*3, so s=2.

Then t = (i-1) mod k = 74 - 2*26 = 74 - 52 = 22? Since s= floor((i-1)/k), t= (i-1) - s*k

So t=74 - 2*26=74-52=22

t from 0 to k-1=25, so t=22.

Now s=2, which is the west side.

P(s) for s=2: P(2) = (-1, k) ? Earlier for s=2: P=(-1,k)

k=26, so P=(-1,26)

Then dir(s)=(-1,0) for west.

So cell at P + t * dir = (-1,26) + 22 * (-1,0) = (-1 -22, 26 +0) = (-23,26)

So coordinates (q,r) = (-23,26)

Now, we need the six neighbors:

As per earlier:

1. (q+1,r) = (-22,26)

2. (q,r+1) = (-23,27)

3. (q-1,r+1) = (-24,27)

4. (q-1,r) = (-24,26)

5. (q,r-1) = (-23,25)

6. (q+1,r-1) = (-22,25)

Now, each neighbor has a number, which we need to find, then sum them.

But these neighbors may be in different rings, so we need to find which ring each is in and its position.

Since the grid is filled in spiral order, we can find the ring for each neighbor by computing its distance from center or by the max norm.

In hexagonal grid, the ring number k for a cell (q,r) is the minimum number such that |q| + |r| + |q+r| ≤ something, but actually in axial coordinates, the distance from center is max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| ) or something.

Standard hexagonal distance: the distance from (0,0) to (q,r) is ( |q| + |r| + |q+r| ) / 2 ? Earlier we had for adjacent cells, |dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr| =2, and distance is 1, so distance d satisfies d = ( |dq| + |dr| + |dq+dr| ) / 2

But for a cell, the ring k is such that the distance d = k.

For example, center (0,0): d=0

(1,0): |1|+|0|+|1+0|=1+0+1=2, d=1

(1,1): |1|+|1|+|2|=1+1+2=4, d=2? But should be adjacent? (1,1) is adjacent to (0,0)? dq=1,dr=1,ds= - (1+1)= -2? Earlier distance formula: the distance is ( |dq| + |dr| + |ds| ) / 2 where s= -q-r, so ds = - (q2+r2) - (-q1-r1) = - (q2+q1 + r2+r1) no.

For two points, delta q, delta r, then delta s = - (delta q + delta r), since s= -q-r.

Then distance = ( |delta q| + |delta r| + |delta s| ) / 2

For (0,0) and (1,1): delta q=1, delta r=1, delta s= - (1+1) = -2, so |1|+|1|+|-2|=4, dist=4/2=2, but they are not adjacent; in fact, (1,1) is two steps away, e.g., via (1,0) or (0,1).

In our grid, (1,1) is in ring 2? For k=1, cells are at distance 1, but (1,1) has distance 2 from center, since min path length 2.

In ring k, distance is k.

For (q,r), distance d = max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| ) ? For (1,0): max(1,0,1)=1, good.

(1,1): max(1,1,2)=2, good.

(2,0): max(2,0,2)=2, but in ring k=2? For k=2, distance should be 2.

(2,-1): max(2,1,1)=2? |r|=1, |q+r|=|2-1|=1, max=2, yes.

(0,2): max(0,2,2)=2, good.

Now for (0,0): max(0,0,0)=0.

(0,1): max(0,1,1)=1, in ring 1.

(3,0): max(3,0,3)=3, ring 3.

But is it always integer? Yes.

In general, for axial coordinates, the distance from center is max( |q|, |r|, |q+r| ).

Since |q|, |r|, |q+r| are the absolute values, and max of them.

We can compute d = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|)

Then ring number k = d.

Total cells up to ring k is T(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1) as before.

For a cell (q,r), k = max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|)

Then within the ring, we need to find its index i.

But since we have the coordinates, and we can compute k, then we need to find the position in the ring.

For our neighbors, we can compute their (q,r), then k, then find the number.

But finding the index in the ring might be a bit tricky, but possible.

Since we have the spiral order, but perhaps for each neighbor, compute k and then the position.

First, for our cell: (q,r) = (-23,26)

d = max(|-23|, |26|, |-23+26|) = max(23,26,3) = 26

So k=26, which matches.

Now neighbors:

N1: (q+1,r) = (-22,26)

d1 = max(|-22|,|26|,|-22+26|)=max(22,26,4)=26

So same ring k=26

N2: (q,r+1) = (-23,27)

d2 = max(23,27,4)=27

So k=27

N3: (q-1,r+1) = (-24,27)

d3 = max(24,27,3)=27

k=27

N4: (q-1,r) = (-24,26)

d4 = max(24,26,2)=26? |-24+26|=|2|=2, max(24,26,2)=26

k=26

N5: (q,r-1) = (-23,25)

d5 = max(23,25,2)=25? |-23+25|=|2|=2, max(23,25,2)=25

k=25

N6: (q+1,r-1) = (-22,25)

d6 = max(22,25,3)=25? |-22+25|=3, max(22,25,3)=25

k=25

So neighbors are in rings: N1:k=26, N2:k=27, N3:k=27, N4:k=26, N5:k=25, N6:k=25

Now we need to find the number for each.

Since k=25,26,27, and T(k) is known, we can find the number by finding the position in the ring.

First, for a cell in ring k, with coordinates (q,r), we need to find which side it's on and t.

From earlier, for each side, we have the range.

Since we have the formula for the spiral, we can compute the start of each side and find where it fits.

For a given (q,r) in ring k, we can determine s and t.

From the expressions for P(s) and dir(s), we can solve.

For example, for s=0: cells with q=k, r from 1-k to 0

Specifically, r = 1-k + t for t=0 to k-1

Since dir=(0,1), so r = (1-k) + t

q = k

Similarly for other sides.

s=0: q = k, r = 1-k + t, t=0,1,...,k-1

s=1: q = (k-1) - t ? Since dir=(-1,1), P=(k-1,1), so q = (k-1) + t * (-1) = k-1 - t

r = 1 + t * 1 = 1 + t

t=0 to k-1

s=2: P=(-1,k), dir=(-1,0), so q = -1 + t * (-1) = -1 - t

r = k + t * 0 = k

t=0 to k-1

s=3: P=(-k,k-1), dir=(0,-1), so q = -k + t * 0 = -k

r = (k-1) + t * (-1) = k-1 - t

t=0 to k-1

s=4: P=(-k,-1), dir=(1,-1), so q = -k + t * 1 = -k + t

r = -1 + t * (-1) = -1 - t

t=0 to k-1

s=5: P=(0,-k), dir=(1,0), so q = 0 + t * 1 = t

r = -k + t * 0 = -k

t=0 to k-1

Now for each neighbor, we can find which s and t it belongs to in its ring.

First, neighbor N1: (-22,26), k=26

Check s=0: q=k=26? But q=-22 ≠26, no

s=1: q=k-1-t=26-1-t=25-t

r=1+t

Set q=-22, r=26

So -22=25-t ⇒ t=25+22=47? But t≤k-1=25, 47>25, impossible.

q=25-t=-22 ⇒ t=25+22=47>25, no.

s=2: q=-1-t, r=k=26

Set r=26, good.

q=-1-t=-22 ⇒ -1-t=-22 ⇒ t=21

t=21, which is between 0 and 25, yes.

So s=2, t=21

Now, the number is the i-th cell in ring k=26.

i = s*k + t + 1? Since s from 0 to 5, t from 0 to k-1, and i starts at 1.

For given s,t, i = s*k + t + 1? Check for k=2, s=0,t=0: i=0*2+0+1=1, cell 8, correct.

s=0,t=1: i=0*2+1+1=2, cell 9, good.

s=1,t=0: i=1*2+0+1=3, cell 10, good.

s=1,t=1: i=1*2+1+1=4, cell 11, good.

s=2,t=0: i=2*2+0+1=5, cell 12, good.

So i = s*k + t + 1

Here s=2, t=21, k=26, i=2*26 + 21 + 1=52+21+1=74

Now, this is the index in the ring. The actual number is T(k-1) + i

T(k-1) is the last number of previous ring, so first of ring k is T(k-1) + 1, so number n = T(k-1) + i

Here k=26, T(25)=1951, i=74, so n=1951 + 74 = 2025? But our original cell is 2026, and this is neighbor.

1951 + 74 = 2025

But original is 2026, so neighbor is 2025? But they should be adjacent, but 2025 and 2026 are consecutive? Possibly.

But let's confirm.

T(25)=1951, ring 26 starts at 1952.

i=1:1952, i=2:1953, ..., i=74:1952 + 73? Since i=1 is first, so n = T(k-1) + i = 1951 + i

T(k-1) is the last of ring k-1, so n = T(k-1) + i

For i=1, n=1951+1=1952, good.

So for i=74, n=1951+74=2025

Now, our cell is at i=75 for same ring? Earlier for original cell, i=75, n=1951+75=2026, yes.

So N1 is at (-22,26), which is west of original (-23,26), since q decreased, so yes, adjacent, and number 2025.

But is it adjacent? Original q=-23,r=26, neighbor q=-22,r=26? dq=1, dr=0, so east? But we have (q+1,r), which is east.

In our list, neighbor N1 is (q+1,r)=(-22,26), which is to the east.

Original is (-23,26), so east neighbor is (-22,26), yes.

And numbers 2025 and 2026, consecutive, so likely adjacent in spiral, but in this case, since same ring and adjacent coordinates, yes.

Now N2: (q,r+1)=(-23,27), k=27

d=max(23,27,4)=27, yes.

Now in ring k=27.

Find s and t.

s=0: q=k=27? q=-23≠27, no

s=1: q=25-t? k=27, q=k-1-t=26-t

r=1+t

Set q=-23, r=27

So -23=26-t ⇒ t=26+23=49

t≤k-1=26, 49>26, no

s=2: q=-1-t, r=k=27

Set r=27, good.

q=-1-t=-23 ⇒ -1-t=-23 ⇒ t=22

t=22≤26, yes.

So s=2, t=22

i=s*k + t +1=2*27 +22 +1=54+22+1=77

n=T(k-1) + i

T(k-1)=T(26)=3*26*27 +1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107? Earlier we computed T(26)=2107

T(k)=3k(k+1)+1, so T(26)=3*26*27+1=3*702+1=2106+1=2107

So n=2107 + 77? n=T(k-1) + i, k=27, k-1=26, T(26)=2107, i=77

So n=2107 + 77=2184

T(k-1) is last of ring k-1, so first of ring k is T(k-1)+1=2108, so i=1:2108, i=77:2108 + 76? Since i=1 is first, so n = T(k-1) + i = 2107 + i

For i=1, n=2108, yes.

So n=2107 + 77=2184

Now N3: (q-1,r+1)=(-24,27), k=27

Same ring.

s=0: q=27? no

s=1: q=26-t, r=1+t

Set q=-24, r=27

-24=26-t ⇒ t=26+24=50>26, no

s=2: q=-1-t, r=27

Set r=27, good.

q=-1-t=-24 ⇒ -1-t=-24 ⇒ t=23

t=23≤26, yes.

s=2, t=23

i=2*27 +23 +1=54+23+1=78

n=T(26)+78=2107+78=2185

Now N4: (q-1,r)=(-24,26), k=26

Original ring.

s=0: q=26? no

s=1: q=25-t, r=1+t

Set q=-24, r=26

-24=25-t ⇒ t=25+24=49>25, no

s=2: q=-1-t, r=26

Set r=26, good.

q=-1-t=-24 ⇒ -1-t=-24 ⇒ t=23

t=23≤25, yes.

s=2, t=23

i=2*26 +23 +1=52+23+1=76

n=T(25)+76=1951+76=2027

Original is 2026, so neighbor is 2027.

Now N5: (q,r-1)=(-23,25), k=25

d=max(23,25,|-23+25|)=max(23,25,2)=25, yes.

Ring k=25.

Find s and t.

s=0: q=25? no

s=1: q=24-t? k=25, q=k-1-t=24-t

r=1+t

Set q=-23, r=25

-23=24-t ⇒ t=24+23=47>24? k-1=24, t≤24, 47>24, no

s=2: q=-1-t, r=k=25

Set r=25, good.

q=-1-t=-23 ⇒ -1-t=-23 ⇒ t=22

t=22≤24, yes.

s=2, t=22

i=s*k + t +1=2*25 +22 +1=50+22+1=73

n=T(k-1) + i = T(24) + 73

T(24)=3*24*25 +1=3*600+1=1800+1=1801

So n=1801 + 73=1874

T(24)=1801, ring 25 starts at 1802, i=1:1802, so i=73:1802 + 72? n=T(24) + i =1801 + i, so for i=1:1802, yes; i=73:1801+73=1874

Now N6: (q+1,r-1)=(-22,25), k=25

Same ring.

s=0: q=25? no

s=1: q=24-t, r=1+t

Set q=-22, r=25

-22=24-t ⇒ t=24+22=46>24, no

s=2: q=-1-t, r=25

Set r=25, good.

q=-1-t=-22 ⇒ -1-t=-22 ⇒ t=21

t=21≤24, yes.

s=2, t=21

i=2*25 +21 +1=50+21+1=72

n=T(24)+72=1801+72=1873

Now, we have all neighbors:

N1: (-22,26) : 2025

N2: (-23,27) : 2184

N3: (-24,27) : 2185

N4: (-24,26) : 2027

N5: (-23,25) : 1874

N6: (-22,25) : 1873

Sum = 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873

Compute step by step.

First, 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 1873 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now sum these: 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Add: 7799 + 4369.

7800 + 4369 = 12169, minus 1: 12168? 7799 + 4369.

7000+4000=11000

799+369=799+300=1099+69=1168? Better: 7799 + 4369.

7799 + 4000 = 11799

11799 + 300 = 12099? 4369 = 4000 + 369? Better: 7799 + 4369.

Add thousands: 7000+4000=11000

Hundreds: 700+300=1000, total 12000

Tens: 90+60=150, total 12150

Units: 9+9=18, total 12168.

Yes.

Now 4052 + 3747 = 4000+3700=7700, 52+47=99, total 7799.

Then 7799 + 4369 = as above, 12168.

But we have three sums: 4052 (N1+N4), 3747 (N5+N6), 4369 (N2+N3), sum is 4052+3747+4369=12168.

Now is this the sum? But let me confirm the numbers.

Original cell: (-23,26), number 2026

Neighbors:

East: (-22,26):2025

North: (-23,27)? Earlier N2 is (q,r+1)=(-23,27):2184

But in hex grid, (q,r+1) is north, yes.

Northwest: (q-1,r+1)=(-24,27):2185

West: (q-1,r)=(-24,26):2027

Southwest: (q,r-1)=(-23,25):1874? But southwest should be (q-1,r) or something? Earlier we defined neighbors as:

1. (q+1,r) east

2. (q,r+1) north

3. (q-1,r+1) northwest

4. (q-1,r) west

5. (q,r-1) south? Earlier we said south is (q,r-1), but in some definitions, south might be different, but in our coordinate, (q,r-1) is directly south, since r decreased.

Southeast: (q+1,r-1)=(-22,25):1873

And southwest? We have (q-1,r) west, (q,r-1) south, but southwest should be (q-1,r-1)? But in our list, we don't have that.

Mistake!

Earlier I defined the six neighbors as:

(q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)

But (q-1,r+1) is northwest, (q-1,r) is west, (q,r-1) is south, (q+1,r-1) is southeast, but what about southwest?

Southwest should be (q-1,r-1)? But it's not in the list.

For example, from (0,0), neighbors include (-1,-1)? But in our initial, southwest was (0,-1) for center? No.

Center (0,0):

- East: (1,0)

- North: (0,1)

- Northwest: (-1,1)

- West: (-1,0)

- Southwest: (0,-1)? But (0,-1) is south, not southwest.

Southwest should be (-1,-1)?

But in the spiral, for center, neighbors are (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)

So (0,-1) is south, (1,-1) is southeast, (-1,-1) is not a neighbor; distance: from (0,0) to (-1,-1): dq=-1,dr=-1,ds= -(-1-1)=2? |dq|=1,|dr|=1,|ds|=2, dist=(1+1+2)/2=2, so not adjacent.

The six neighbors are as listed: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)

So southwest is not directly adjacent; in this axial system, the directions are east, north, northwest, west, south, southeast? But southwest is missing.

Actually, in this coordinate system, the southwest neighbor would be (q-1,r) if we define differently, but in this case, for center, west is (-1,0), south is (0,-1), but southwest is not a direct neighbor; it's diagonal.

In hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors, but in this axial coordinate, the neighbors are exactly those six: offset in q and r such that the sum of changes is consistent, but here it's asymmetric.

In our list, for center, we have:

- (1,0): east

- (0,1): north

- (-1,1): northwest

- (-1,0): west

- (0,-1): south

- (1,-1): southeast

So indeed, southwest is not present; instead, we have northwest and southeast.

But in a hexagon, it should be symmetric; probably the coordinate system is oriented such that the axes are not symmetric.

But in any case, for our grid, as per the initial setup, these are the neighbors.

In the initial diagram, for center 1, neighbors include south (0,-1):6, southeast (1,-1):7, etc., but no southwest directly; southwest would be, say, (-1,-1), but it's not adjacent.

So for our cell (-23,26), the neighbors are as we listed: east, north, northwest, west, south, southeast.

And we computed all six.

Now sum is 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168

But let me verify with a small example to ensure.

Take center cell 1 at (0,0)

Neighbors:

(1,0):2

(0,1):3

(-1,1):4

(-1,0):5

(0,-1):6

(1,-1):7

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7=27

Now according to our method, but for k=0? We didn't handle, but anyway.

Take a cell in ring 1, say cell 2 at (1,0)

Neighbors: should include center (0,0):1, and others.

Adjacent: (2,0)? But in ring 1, (2,0) not present.

(1,1), (1,-1), (0,0), (0,1)? Let's compute.

From (1,0):

- (q+1,r)=(2,0)

- (q,r+1)=(1,1)

- (q-1,r+1)=(0,1)

- (q-1,r)=(0,0)

- (q,r-1)=(1,-1)

- (q+1,r-1)=(2,-1)

Now in the grid, which are present: (0,0):1, (0,1):3, (1,1):? In ring 1, (1,1) is not occupied; ring 1 has only the six neighbors, but (1,1) is not in ring 1; distance max(1,1,2)=2, so ring 2.

Similarly, (2,0): ring 2, (1,-1): ring 1? (1,-1):7, yes, since southwest neighbor.

For cell 2 at (1,0), neighbors:

- East: (2,0): but not yet filled? In spiral, after 2 is 3,4,etc., but (2,0) is cell 9 in ring 2.

But physically adjacent cells: (0,0):1, (1,1):? Not occupied yet? When cell 2 is placed, only center is filled, so adjacent cells are (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(2,-1),(1,-1)? But (0,1) is adjacent, (1,1) adjacent, etc.

In the grid, at (1,0), neighbors are:

- West: (0,0):1

- Northwest: (0,1):3? From (1,0) to (0,1): adjacent, yes.

- North: (1,1)? Adjacent.

- East: (2,0)

- Southeast: (2,-1)? Or (1,-1)

Specifically: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (1,-1)? But (2,-1) and (1,-1) are both adjacent? Distance to (2,-1): dq=1,dr=-1,ds=0? |1|+|-1|+|0|=2, dist=1, yes.

Similarly to (1,-1): dq=0,dr=-1,ds=1? |0|+|-1|+|1|=2, dist=1.

But in a hex, each cell has exactly six neighbors, so yes.

But in ring 1, when cell 2 is placed, the neighbors that are filled are only (0,0):1, but others are empty but will be filled later.

For the purpose of the grid, the neighbors exist, but some may not have numbers yet if the spiral hasn't reached, but in this case, since the spiral fills outward, for a cell in ring k, neighbors in ring k-1 are already filled, neighbors in ring k may or may not be filled, but since spiral fills ring by ring, actually for cells in ring k, when it's placed, neighbors in rings <k are filled, neighbors in ring k may be filled if earlier in spiral, but since spiral traverses the ring in order, some neighbors in same ring may be filled, some not yet.

But for the final grid, all cells are filled, so we can compute the numbers as we did.

For cell 2 at (1,0), neighbors:

(0,0):1 (ring 0)

(0,1):3 (ring 1)

(1,1):? In ring 2? Distance max(1,1,2)=2, so ring 2, cell 10? Earlier for k=2, (1,1):10

(2,0):9 (ring 2)

(2,-1):8 (ring 2)

(1,-1):7 (ring 1)

So neighbors: 1,3,10,9,8,7

Sum:1+3+7+8+9+10=38? But earlier I thought it should be adjacent to 1,3,7, and others.

In the spiral, when cell 2 is placed, only center is filled, so immediate neighbors are not all filled, but eventually, the six adjacent cells are these: west:1, northwest:3? (0,1) is northwest? From (1,0), (0,1) is northwest, yes.

North: (1,1):10, east: (2,0):9, southeast: (2,-1):8? Or (1,-1):7? (1,-1) is south or southeast.

In coordinates, from (1,0):

- (q-1,r)=(0,0):1 west? Or southwest? Earlier we defined (q-1,r) as west.

But in direction, (0,0) is southwest? But in our list, we have (q-1,r) as west, but for center relative, it might be different.

The numbers: 1,3,7,8,9,10.

7 is at (1,-1), which is south or southeast.

Sum is 1+3+7+8+9+10=38.

Now according to our formula, but for k=1, we have issue, but let's compute as we did.

For cell (1,0), k=max(1,0,1)=1, ring k=1.

i: in ring 1, s and t.

Earlier for k=1, we have s=0,t=0: (1,0):2? But we need neighbors.

But for neighbors, we can compute their coordinates and find numbers.

For example, neighbor (0,0): q=0,r=0, d=max(0,0,0)=0, ring 0, only one cell, number 1.

(0,1): q=0,r=1, d=max(0,1,1)=1, ring 1.

In ring 1, find s,t.

s=0: q=k=1? q=0≠1, no

s=1: q=k-1-t=0-t? k=1, q=1-1-t=0-t? Set q=0, so 0=0-t ⇒ t=0

r=1+t=1+0=1, good.

s=1,t=0

i=s*k + t +1=1*1 +0 +1=2

n=T(k-1)+i=T(0)+2=1+2=3? T(0)=1 (since ring 0 has one cell), so n=1+2=3, yes, cell 3.

Similarly, (1,1): q=1,r=1, d=max(1,1,2)=2, ring 2.

s=0: q=2? no

s=1: q=1-t? k=2, q=k-1-t=1-t? Set q=1, so 1=1-t ⇒ t=0

r=1+t=1+0=1, good.

s=1,t=0

i=1*2 +0 +1=3? But ring 2 starts at T(1)+1=7+1=8, i=1:8, i=2:9, i=3:10, yes, cell 10.

Similarly, (2,0): q=2,r=0, d=max(2,0,2)=2, ring 2.

s=0: q=2? yes, r=1-k=1-2=-1? Set r=1-k+t? s=0: r=1-2+t=-1+t

Set r=0, so -1+t=0 ⇒ t=1

i=s*k+t+1=0*2+1+1=2? n=T(1)+2=7+2=9? T(1)=7, n=7+2=9, yes.

(2,-1): q=2,r=-1, d=max(2,1,1)=2, ring 2.

s=0: q=2, r=1-2+t=-1+t, set r=-1, so -1+t=-1 ⇒ t=0

i=0*2+0+1=1, n=7+1=8, yes.

(1,-1): q=1,r=-1, d=max(1,1,0)=1? |q+r|=|0|=0, max(1,1,0)=1, ring 1.

s=0: q=1? yes, r=1-1+t=0+t, set r=-1, so t=-1? not possible.

s=1: q=0-t? k=1, q=1-1-t=0-t? Set q=1? 0-t=1 ⇒ t=-1, no.

s=2: q=-1-t, r=k=1? Set r=1, but r=-1≠1, no.

s=3: q=-k=-1, r=k-1-t=0-t, set q=1≠-1, no.

s=4: q=-k+t=-1+t, r=-1-t, set q=1, r=-1

So 1=-1+t ⇒ t=2? But t≤k-1=0, no.

s=5: q=t, r=-k=-1, set r=-1, good.

q=t=1? So t=1, but k=1, t≤0? t=1>0, no.

Problem, as before.

But we know it should be cell 7.

In ring 1, s=5: P=(0,-k)=(0,-1), dir=(1,0), t=0: (0,-1)? But we need (1,-1).

s=4: P=(-k,-1)=(-1,-1), dir=(1,-1), t=0: (-1,-1)

Not (1,-1).

So for k=1, it doesn't work, but for our case k=26>1, and neighbors are in k=25,26,27 all greater than 1, so should be fine.

For (1,-1), in ring 1, it corresponds to s=5? But formula gives (0,-1) for s=5,t=0.

Perhaps adjust, but since for n=2026, neighbors are all in rings >=25, no issue.

Back to our sum: 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168

But let me write them:

N1: 2025

N2: 2184

N3: 2185

N4: 2027

N5: 1874

N6: 1873

Sum: group: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

1874 + 1873 = 3747

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Now, is this correct? Notice that N1 and N4 are adjacent to original and to each other? But we don't need that.

Since original is 2026, and neighbors include 2025 and 2027, which are consecutive, and others.

But sum seems large, but for large n, neighbors can be larger or smaller.

Another way to check: the sum should be roughly 6 times average, but average around 2000, 6*2000=12000, 12168 is close.

But let me verify one neighbor.

For example, N5: (-23,25), k=25, s=2,t=22, i=73, n=1874

T(24)=1801, so ring 25 starts at 1802.

i=73, so n=1801 + 73=1874? Since i=1:1802=1801+1, i=73:1801+73=1874, and since consecutive, i=73 is the 73rd cell, so n=1801 + 73=1874, but 1801 +73=1874, and 1802 +72=1874? 1802+72=1874, yes, since i=1:1802, i=73:1802+72=1874.

Similarly, original cell is at (-23,26), k=26, i=75, n=1951+75=2026, correct.

Now the neighbor to the south: (q,r-1)=(-23,25), which we have as N5:1874

Is it adjacent? Coordinates (-23,25) and (-23,26), dq=0, dr=-1, ds=1? |0|+|-1|+|1|=2, dist=1, yes.

Similarly, others.

So all seem correct.

Thus sum is 12168.

But the problem asks for the sum of all six neighbors, so answer should be 12168.

Now to box it.

But let me confirm the addition once more.

List: 1873, 1874, 2025, 2027, 2184, 2185

Sort: 1873,1874,2025,2027,2184,2185

Add in pairs:

1873+2185=4058? 1873+2185: 1800+2100=3900, 73+85=158, total 4058

Better: 1873+2185= (1870+2180) + (3+5)=4050+8=4058? 1870+2180=4050, yes.

But earlier I had different grouping.

1874 + 2184 = 1870+2180=4050? 1874+2184=1874+2000=3874, +184=3874+180=4054, +4=4058? 3874+184=4058? 3874+180=4054, +4=4058.

1874+2184: 1800+2100=3900, 74+84=158, total 3900+158=4058.

Similarly, 2025+2027=4052

Then 1873+2185=4058? Same as above.

But we have three pairs? No, six numbers.

I have: N6:1873, N5:1874, N1:2025, N4:2027, N2:2184, N3:2185

So sum: 1873+1874=3747

2025+2027=4052

2184+2185=4369

Then 3747+4052=7799

7799+4369=12168

1873+2185=4058? But that's mixing.

Total sum: add all.

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369:

7799 + 4000 = 11799

11799 + 369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, +69=12168

Yes.

7799 + 4369: 7800 + 4369 = 12169, minus 1 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

Therefore, the answer is 12168.

The number 2026 is located at coordinates \((-23, 26)\) in the hexagonal grid spiral, which places it in ring 26. The six neighbors of this cell are found using the axial coordinate system, and their coordinates and corresponding numbers are as follows:

- East neighbor \((q+1, r) = (-22, 26)\) corresponds to number 2025.
- North neighbor \((q, r+1) = (-23, 27)\) corresponds to number 2184.
- Northwest neighbor \((q-1, r+1) = (-24, 27)\) corresponds to number 2185.
- West neighbor \((q-1, r) = (-24, 26)\) corresponds to number 2027.
- South neighbor \((q, r-1) = (-23, 25)\) corresponds to number 1874.
- Southeast neighbor \((q+1, r-1) = (-22, 25)\) corresponds to number 1873.

The sum of these neighbors is calculated as:
\[
2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 = 12168.
\]

The neighbors are distributed across rings 25, 26, and 27, and their numbers are determined based on their positions within their respective rings using the spiral order formula. The ring numbers and positions are verified using the distance formula \(d = \max(|q|, |r|, |q + r|)\), which gives the ring number \(k = d\).

Thus, the sum of all six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

\boxed{12168}
