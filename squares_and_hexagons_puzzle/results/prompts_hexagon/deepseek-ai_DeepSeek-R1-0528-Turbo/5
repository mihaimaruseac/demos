<think>
The problem involves a spiral on a hexagonal grid with natural numbers. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the example:

... 14  4  3 10 ...

.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

... 16  6  7  8 ...

It seems like 1 is at the center, surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7. Looking at the neighbors of 1: directly above it is 2? In the second row, it's 15,5,1,2,9. So to the right of 1 is 2. Below it might be 7? The third row is 16,6,7,8. So below and left is 6,7,8. But 7 is directly below 1? Let me sketch this.

Assume a hexagonal grid. Each cell has six neighbors. The center is 1. According to the grid:

- To the right: 2

- Below-right: 9? But 9 is in the second row: 15,5,1,2,9. So after 2 is 9, but that might not be adjacent.

Perhaps the rows are offset. In hexagonal grids, rows are often offset.

Looking at the sequence: starting from center 1.

The neighbors should be the six cells around it.

From the grid:

Above 1: in the first row, above 1 is 4 and 3? But 4 and 3 are to the left.

List the positions.

Denote the center cell as position (0,0).

In hexagonal grids, coordinates can be tricky. Often, axial coordinates are used.

But perhaps I can define directions.

From the grid:

Cell 1 is surrounded by:

- Right: 2 (since in the same row, next is 2)

- Down-right: ? Below and right. Looking at third row: 16,6,7,8. 7 is below 1? But 7 is directly below, and 6 is left-down, 8 is right-down.

But in the second row, after 1 is 2, then 9. And above, first row has 14,4,3,10.

So above 1 is probably 3 or 4. Let's see the neighbors.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are filled in a spiral pattern around the center.

Start at 1.

Then move in some direction, say east, to 2.

Then south-east to 3? But in the grid, after 2 is 9? That doesn't match.

Perhaps the spiral goes: from 1 to 2 (east), then to 3 (north-east), then to 4 (north-west), then to 5 (west), then to 6 (south-west), then to 7 (south), then to 8 (east again), but 8 is after 7, but in the grid, after 7 is 8, but then next should be 9, which is in the second row.

In the sequence: 1, then 2, then probably 3 is next, but in the grid, 3 is above, so perhaps after 1, it goes to 2 (right), then to 3 (up-right), then to 4 (up-left), then to 5 (left), then to 6 (down-left), then to 7 (down), then to 8 (down-right? but 8 is to the right of 7).

From the grid positions:

Assume the center is 1.

Immediately to the right is 2.

Above and to the right is 3? In the first row, it's 14,4,3,10, so 3 is to the left of 4, but relative to 1.

Perhaps the cell directly above 1 is 4? But then 3 is to the right of 4, which would be up-right from 1.

Let's list the neighbors of 1.

From the grid, the cells adjacent to 1 should be 2,3,4,5,6,7.

In the second row: 15,5,1,2,9. So left of 1 is 5? 5 is to the left.

In the third row: 16,6,7,8. So below, we have 6,7. 7 is directly below 1? But 6 is left of 7, so left-down from 1.

And in the first row: 14,4,3,10. So 4 and 3 are above. 4 is probably directly above, 3 is up-right, but then 10 is further.

But for neighbors of 1, it should be the six cells: left:5, up-left:4? Let's see the relative positions.

Perhaps it's easier to see that 1 is surrounded by 2,3,4,5,6,7.

From the sequence, after 1 comes 2, then probably 3, but in the grid, 3 is in the first row, while 2 is in the same row as 1.

In the second row, it's 15,5,1,2,9, so from left to right: 15,5,1,2,9.

Third row: 16,6,7,8.

First row: 14,4,3,10.

So for cell 1 at (0,0):

- Right: 2 at (0,1) or something.

- Left: 5 at (-1,0) or (-1,-1)? 5 is in the same row as 1, to the left, so probably (-1,0) if we assume a cartesian grid, but hexagonal is different.

To simplify, in hexagonal grid, we can define the six directions as: E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.

From the grid, relative to 1:

- E: 2

- W: 5? In the same row, left is 5.

- NE: 3? Because in first row, 3 is above and right, since first row is offset or something.

In standard hexagonal tiling, rows are offset.

Assume that the row of 1 is row 0, with cells at x=0:1, x=1:2, but then there is 5 at x=-1, so row 0: x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9? But 9 is not a neighbor.

For neighbors only.

Cell above row 0 is row 1 (above).

In row 1: cells at x=0:4? But in the grid, first row has 14,4,3,10, so probably x= -1:14, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10 or something.

Then cell at (0,0):1

Cell at (0,1):2

Cell at (1,0):4? But (1,0) is directly above? Then (1,1):3

Then cell below row 0 is row -1.

Row -1: 16,6,7,8, so x= -1:16, x=0:6, x=1:7, x=2:8

So cell at (-1,0):5? In row 0, x=-1:5

Row -1, x=0:6, x=1:7

Now, neighbors of (0,0):

- East: (1,0)? But (1,0) is in row 1, which is above, not east.

In hexagonal grid with axial coordinates, it's better to use a different system.

Commonly, for hex grid, we use cube coordinates or axial.

Let me define the six neighbors of a cell (x,y) as:

- (x+1,y), (x-1,y) // east-west

- (x,y+1), (x,y-1) // but in hex, it's not orthogonal.

Standard cube coordinates: each cell has coordinates (q,r,s) with q+r+s=0.

Then neighbors are (q+1,r-1,s), (q+1,r,s-1), (q,r+1,s-1), (q-1,r+1,s), (q-1,r,s+1), (q,r-1,s+1), but that's messy.

For this spiral, I can find the ring number and position.

I recall that in hexagonal spirals, the numbers are arranged in layers or rings.

The center is 1, ring 0, size 1.

Then ring 1 has 6 cells: 2 to 7.

In the example, 2,3,4,5,6,7 are around 1.

Then ring 2 has 12 cells? From 8 to 19 or something.

In the grid, after 7 is 8, then 9,10, etc.

From the grid: after 7 is 8 (in third row), then probably 9 is next, which is in second row after 2, so 9 is at the end.

Then next might be 10 in first row, then 11,12, etc.

The sequence given is incomplete, but we can infer the order.

Typically, the spiral starts at center, moves in one direction, and turns at corners.

For hexagonal spiral, it often moves in six directions, adding a layer each time.

The k-th ring has 6k cells, for k>=1, and the first number in ring k is 1 + 3k(k-1) +1 or something.

Let me calculate the starting number of each ring.

Ring 0: cell 1, size 1.

Ring 1: cells 2 to 7, size 6.

Ring 2: cells 8 to 19? Size should be 12 for k=2, since each ring adds 6 cells, but ring 1 has 6, ring 2 should have 12, ring 3 has 18, etc., total cells up to ring k is 1 + 6*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 6*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Up to ring k, number of cells is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

So last number in ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1)

Then first number in ring k is [1 + 3(k-1)k] + 1

For ring k (k>=1), first number is 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1? Last of ring k-1 is 1 + 3(k-1)k, so first of ring k is 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For example, ring 1 (k=1): first number = 2 + 3*1*0 = 2, yes, cells 2 to 7.

Ring 2 (k=2): first number = 2 + 3*2*1 = 2 + 6 = 8, so cells 8 to ? last of ring 2 is 1 + 3*2*3 = 1 + 18 = 19, so 8 to 19, size 12.

In the grid, we see 8 in third row, then 9,10,11,12,... up to 19.

But in the given grid, we have up to 16, but it shows 14,15,16, so probably 17,18,19 are further.

Now, the neighbors of a number depend on its position in the spiral.

Specifically, for a number n, I need to find its coordinates, then find the six adjacent cells, and sum their values.

Since the grid is symmetric, neighbors might be symmetric in some way, but for sum, perhaps I can find which numbers are neighbors.

But neighbors are adjacent cells, so their numbers are close, but not necessarily consecutive.

For example, neighbors of 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum is 2+3+4+5+6+7=27.

But for larger n, it's different.

Now, I need for 2026.

First, find which ring it is in.

Find k such that the last number of ring k-1 is less than or equal to 2026, and last of ring k is greater than or equal.

Last number of ring k is L(k) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Set L(k) >= 2026

So 1 + 3k(k+1) >= 2026

3k^2 + 3k - 2025 >= 0

k^2 + k - 675 >= 0

Solve quadratic: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+2700)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2701)]/2

sqrt(2701), let me compute: 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97, so k >= [-1+51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈ 25.485

So k >= 26? Since k integer.

Check k=25: L(25)=1 + 3*25*26=1+3*650=1+1950=1951

1951 < 2026

k=26: L(26)=1 + 3*26*27=1+3*702=1+2106=2107

2107 >= 2026, so yes, ring 26.

First number of ring k is F(k) = L(k-1) + 1 = [1 + 3(k-1)k] + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=26, F(26)=2 + 3*26*25=2+3*650=2+1950=1952

Last number L(26)=2107, as above.

So ring 26 has numbers from 1952 to 2107, size 6*26=156, and 2107-1952+1=156, yes.

2026 is in ring 26.

Now, position within the ring.

The ring has 6 sides, each with k cells? For ring k, there are 6 sides, each with k cells.

Ring k has 6k cells.

Each side has k cells.

The sides are in six directions: typically, starting from the "east" or something.

In hexagonal spiral, the ring starts at a certain position.

Usually, the spiral starts at center, moves east to 2, then northeast to 3? But in our earlier, from 1 to 2 (east), then to 3 (north), but in grid, 3 is above, so perhaps north.

In standard hexagonal spiral, after center, it moves in one direction, say east, then at the corner, it turns 60 degrees.

But in this case, from the grid, after 1 (center), it goes to 2 (east), then instead of continuing east, it turns to north-east? But next is probably 3.

In ring 1, cells are 2,3,4,5,6,7 in order.

From the grid, relative to center: 2 is east, then moving counterclockwise: next might be north-east, which is 3? But in grid, 3 is above and right, so NE.

Then north-west? 4 is above and left? In first row, 4 is left of 3, so NW.

Then west: 5 is west.

Then south-west: 6 is below and left.

Then south: 7 is below.

Then south-east? But in ring 1, it ends at 7, which is south, and next ring starts at 8, which might be south-east or east.

In the grid, after 7 is 8, which is to the east of 7? In third row, 7 and 8 are adjacent, with 8 to the right of 7, so east.

But from center, 7 is south, so east of south is south-east? But in hex grid, moving east from south cell might be different.

To avoid confusion, for ring k, the starting cell is at a certain direction.

Typically, for hexagonal spiral, the ring starts at the cell immediately east of the last cell of previous ring, or something.

For ring k, it starts at (k,0) in some coordinate system.

I recall that in hexagonal coordinates, the rings are arranged such that the distance from center is the Manhattan distance or something.

In cube coordinates, the distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|s|), but since q+r+s=0, it's equivalent to (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, but actually for hex grid, the distance is max(|q|,|r|,|s|).

Set center at (0,0,0).

Then ring k consists of all cells where max(|q|,|r|,|s|) = k.

And the number of such cells is 6k for k>=1, since each face has k cells, but total for distance k is 3k(k+1) - 3(k-1)k = 3k^2 + 3k - 3k^2 + 3k = 6k? No.

Total cells within distance k is 1 + 3k(k+1) as before.

Cells at exactly distance k: total up to k minus up to k-1: [1+3k(k+1)] - [1+3(k-1)k] = 3k(k+1) - 3(k-1)k = 3k^2 + 3k - 3k^2 + 3k = 6k, yes.

Now, the spiral order: typically, it traverses the ring in counterclockwise order, starting from a specific point.

Commonly, it starts at (k,0,-k) or something.

For example, ring 1: cells at distance 1: (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1)

Now, which one is first? Probably (1,0,-1) is east or something.

In our grid, center (0,0,0).

East might be (1,0,-1), north-east (0,1,-1), north (-1,1,0), north-west (-1,0,1), south-west (0,-1,1), south (1,-1,0)

In ring 1, first cell is 2, which is east, so (1,0,-1)

Then next in spiral: probably north-east, (0,1,-1), which is 3.

Then north (-1,1,0), 4.

Then north-west (-1,0,1), 5.

Then south-west (0,-1,1), 6.

Then south (1,-1,0), 7.

Matches our earlier: 2 east, 3 NE, 4 north, 5 NW, 6 SW, 7 south.

Now, for ring 2, it starts at (2,0,-2)? After 7, which is south (1,-1,0), the next cell should be adjacent, and start of new ring.

From (1,-1,0), moving east to (2,-1,-1)? But (2,-1,-1) has sum 0? q+r+s=2-1-1=0, yes, and max(|2|,|-1|,|-1|)=2, so distance 2.

In the grid, after 7 is 8, which is to the east? In third row, 7 and 8 are adjacent, with 8 to the right, so if south is down, east is right, so moving east from south cell.

In hex grid, moving east from (1,-1,0): east direction is increasing q, decreasing s? Standard cube directions:

- East: (q+1,r,s-1)

- North-east: (q,r+1,s-1)

- North-west: (q-1,r+1,s)

- West: (q-1,r,s+1)

- South-west: (q,r-1,s+1)

- South: (q+1,r-1,s)? Let me confirm.

From (0,0,0):

- E: (1,0,-1)

- NE: (0,1,-1) or (1,-1,0)? Standard: often E is (1,0,-1), NE is (1,-1,0), but in our earlier, for ring1, we have (1,0,-1) as E, (0,1,-1) as NE? But (0,1,-1) sum is 0, max=1.

But (1,-1,0) is also distance 1, which we called south.

Actually, the directions:

Set:

- E: (q+1,r,s-1)

- NE: (q+1,r-1,s)? Better to define.

The vector for E: (1,0,-1)

NE: (1,-1,0)

N: (0,-1,1)? Sum 0.

Standard:

- East: (1,0,-1)

- Northeast: (0,1,-1)  // if y-axis up, but in our case, perhaps.

In our ring1, we have:

Cell 2: E: (1,0,-1)

Cell 3: NE: (0,1,-1)? But earlier I said NE is (0,1,-1), but in sequence after E is NE.

But from (1,0,-1), moving NE: NE direction is (0,1,-1)? But (0,1,-1) is adjacent to (1,0,-1)? Difference: (0-1,1-0,-1-(-1)) = (-1,1,0), which is not a direction vector.

Adjacent cells differ by vectors: (1,-1,0), (1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)

Each pair differs by one of these vectors.

From (1,0,-1), the neighbors are:

- Add (1,-1,0): (2,-1,-1)

- Add (1,0,-1): (2,0,-2)? But that would be same direction.

Adding the vectors:

Add (1,-1,0): (1+1,0-1,-1+0)=(2,-1,-1)

Add (1,0,-1): (2,0,-2)

Add (0,1,-1): (1,1,-2)

Add (-1,1,0): (0,1,-1)

Add (-1,0,1): (0,0,0) center

Add (0,-1,1): (1,-1,0)

So neighbors of (1,0,-1) are: (2,-1,-1), (2,0,-2), (1,1,-2), (0,1,-1), (0,0,0), (1,-1,0)

In ring1, we have (0,1,-1), (0,0,0), (1,-1,0), etc., but for spiral, from (1,0,-1), the next cell in ring1 is (0,1,-1), which is adjacent, and in the direction counterclockwise.

From (1,0,-1) to (0,1,-1): the vector is (-1,1,0), which is the NW direction? Earlier vectors: (-1,1,0) is one of the direction vectors.

Specifically, (-1,1,0) corresponds to northwest if east is (1,0,-1).

But in our sequence, after E (1,0,-1), we go to NE, which is (0,1,-1), and the vector is (-1,1,0), which might be northwest, but we call it northeast? Perhaps the orientation.

Anyway, for the spiral order, in ring k, it starts at (k,0,-k), and moves in the directions: first along NE, then N, NW, W, SW, S, but for each side.

Typically, for ring k, it starts at (k,0,-k), which is the "east" cell.

Then it moves in six directions: first to "northeast", but in terms of direction changes.

The sequence of directions: for each side, it moves perpendicular to the radial direction.

In ring k, starting at (k,0,-k), which has direction east.

Then it moves along the side: for the first side, it moves in the direction of decreasing q and increasing r? From (k,0,-k), to move counterclockwise, it should decrease q and increase r, so to (k-1,1,-k), but (k-1,1,-k) sum is k-1+1-k=0, max(|k-1|,|1|,|-k|)=k since k>=1, so yes.

Then next? After (k-1,1,-k), it should continue in the same direction? But the side might be straight.

In hexagonal grid, each "side" of the ring is a straight line in one direction.

For example, ring 1: from (1,0,-1) to (0,1,-1)? But that's only one step, but ring 1 has only one cell per "side", but since k=1, each side has one cell.

For ring k, each side has k cells.

For ring 2, size 12, so two cells per side.

Starting at (2,0,-2)

Then moving in the first direction: probably northeast, to (2-1,1,-2)? (1,1,-2)

Then next? If moving in same direction, to (0,2,-2)? But (0,2,-2) sum 0, max=2.

Then after that, it should change direction to north, so to (-1,2,-1)? Or something.

List the cells in order.

For ring 2: starts at (2,0,-2), cell 8.

Then next: in the spiral, after 7 (which is (1,-1,0)), it moves to 8. From (1,-1,0) to (2,0,-2)? Are they adjacent? Difference: (2-1,0-(-1),-2-0)=(1,1,-2), which is a direction vector? The vectors are (1,-1,0), etc., (1,1,-2) is not a unit vector. Adjacent cells must differ by one of the six direction vectors.

From (1,-1,0) to (2,0,-2): difference (1,1,-2), which is not one of the six: (1,-1,0),(1,0,-1),(0,1,-1),(-1,1,0),(-1,0,1),(0,-1,1). None is (1,1,-2). So not adjacent.

Mistake.

In the grid, after 7 is 8, and 7 is at (1,-1,0), which is south. Then 8 is at? In our earlier grid, third row has 6,7,8. 6 is at (-1,0)? Earlier for row -1: x=0:6, x=1:7, x=2:8. But in coordinates, what is 6? Probably (0,-1,1) or something.

Set coordinates.

From ring1:

Cell 2: (1,0,-1)

Cell 3: (0,1,-1)  // NE

Cell 4: (-1,1,0)  // N

Cell 5: (-1,0,1)  // NW

Cell 6: (0,-1,1)  // SW

Cell 7: (1,-1,0)  // S

Now cell 8: next, should be adjacent to 7. Neighbors of (1,-1,0): as computed earlier: add vectors:

Add (1,-1,0): (2,-2,0)? Sum 0, max=2

Add (1,0,-1): (2,-1,-1)

Add (0,1,-1): (1,0,-1) but that's cell 2, already occupied

Add (-1,1,0): (0,0,0) center

Add (-1,0,1): (0,-1,1) cell 6

Add (0,-1,1): (1,-2,1) sum 1-2+1=0, max(|1|,|-2|,|1|)=2

So possible: (2,-2,0), (2,-1,-1), (1,-2,1)

In the grid, after 7 is 8, which is to the east, so probably (2,-1,-1) or (2,-2,0)? In the third row, 7 is at x=1, y=-1 or something, and 8 at x=2, so likely (2,-1,-1) if we assume the same row.

In our row -1, cells: x=0:6, x=1:7, x=2:8, and row -1 is below, so if y-coordinate is decreasing down, then for row y= -1, cells at x=0,1,2.

Cell 6: (0,-1,1)? q+r+s=0-1+1=0, good.

Cell 7: (1,-1,0)? q+r+s=1-1+0=0, good.

Cell 8: (2,-1,-1)? q+r+s=2-1-1=0, good.

And adjacent: from (1,-1,0) to (2,-1,-1): difference (1,0,-1), which is the east vector. So moving east.

So cell 8 is at (2,-1,-1)

Then next cell 9: in the grid, after 8 is 9, but in second row, after 2 is 9, so probably not adjacent in grid, but in spiral order, after 8 should be the next cell in the ring.

From (2,-1,-1), it should move to the next, which might be northeast or something.

In the sequence, after 8 is 9, which is in the second row, at the end: after 2 is 9, so at (2,0,-2)? Or something.

Cell 9: in second row, after 2, so if row 0: x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9? So at (2,0,-2)? q+r+s=2+0-2=0, max=2.

From (2,-1,-1) to (2,0,-2): difference (0,1,-1), which is the northeast vector. So moving NE.

So cell 9: (2,0,-2)

Then next cell 10: in first row, after 3? First row has 14,4,3,10, so after 3 is 10, so at (3,0,-3)? But distance should be 2, max=2, but (3,0,-3) max=3>2, not in ring 2.

Problem.

Cell 10 should be next in spiral. After 9, it should go to another cell.

From (2,0,-2), neighbors: add (1,-1,0): (3,-1,-2) sum 0, max=3>2

Add (1,0,-1): (3,0,-3) max=3

Add (0,1,-1): (2,1,-3) max=3

Add (-1,1,0): (1,1,-2) sum 1+1-2=0, max=2

Add (-1,0,1): (1,0,-1) cell 2, occupied

Add (0,-1,1): (2,-1,-1) cell 8, occupied

So should be (1,1,-2)

Is that adjacent? From (2,0,-2) to (1,1,-2): difference (-1,1,0), which is northwest vector.

So cell 10: (1,1,-2)

But in the grid, where is it? First row has cells, say at y=1, x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10? Earlier I assumed row 1: x=0:4, x=1:3, x=2:10? But 4 is at ( -1,1,0)? Earlier for ring1, cell 4 is at (-1,1,0)

Now for ring2, cell 10 at (1,1,-2)

Then next cell 11: from (1,1,-2), move counterclockwise. Possible neighbors: add vectors.

Add (1,-1,0): (2,0,-2) cell 9, occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (2,1,-3) max=3

Add (0,1,-1): (1,2,-3) max=3

Add (-1,1,0): (0,2,-2) sum 0+2-2=0, max=2

Add (-1,0,1): (0,1,-1) cell 3, occupied

Add (0,-1,1): (1,0,-1) cell 2, occupied

So (0,2,-2)

Cell 11: (0,2,-2)

Then next: from (0,2,-2) to? Add (-1,1,0): (-1,3,-2) max=3

Add (-1,0,1): (-1,2,-1) sum -1+2-1=0, max=2

Add (0,-1,1): (0,1,-1) occupied

Add (1,-1,0): (1,1,-2) occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (1,2,-3) max=3

Add (0,1,-1): (0,3,-3) max=3

So (-1,2,-1)

Cell 12: (-1,2,-1)

And so on.

In the grid, first row has 14,4,3,10. We have cell 10 at (1,1,-2), cell 11 at (0,2,-2), cell 12 at (-1,2,-1), etc.

But in grid, after 3 (which is (0,1,-1)) is 10? But 3 is ring1, 10 is ring2, not adjacent, but in spiral order it's consecutive numbers, but not necessarily adjacent in grid.

For neighbor finding, we need grid adjacency, not spiral order.

Back to the problem: for a given number, find its coordinates, then find its six neighbors, then sum their numbers.

So for n=2026, in ring k=26.

First, find the starting number of ring 26: F(26)=1952, as computed.

The ring has 6*26=156 cells.

The spiral starts at (26,0,-26) ? From the pattern.

In general, for ring k, it starts at (k,0,-k)

Then moves in the direction of decreasing q and increasing r? From earlier ring2: started at (2,-1,-1)? For k=2, we had cell8 at (2,-1,-1), but according to (k,0,-k)=(2,0,-2), which was cell9.

Inconsistency.

In ring2, first cell is 8 at (2,-1,-1), but (k,0,-k)=(2,0,-2) is cell9, the second cell.

So not starting at (k,0,-k).

From the center, the starting point for each ring is in the "southeast" direction or something.

Notice that after each ring, the next ring starts by moving east from the last cell of the previous ring.

For example, ring1 ends at cell7: (1,-1,0)

Then move east: add vector (1,0,-1) to get (2,-1,-1), which is cell8, start of ring2.

Similarly, ring2 ends at? We need to find the last cell of ring2.

Ring2 has cells from 8 to 19.

The order: we have 8:(2,-1,-1), 9:(2,0,-2), 10:(1,1,-2), 11:(0,2,-2), 12:(-1,2,-1), then next: from (-1,2,-1), move counterclockwise.

Possible neighbors: add vectors.

Add (1,-1,0): (0,1,-1) cell3, occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (0,2,-2) cell11, occupied? Wait, adjacent but occupied.

Add (0,1,-1): (-1,3,-2) max=3

Add (-1,1,0): (-2,3,-1) max=3

Add (-1,0,1): (-2,2,0) sum -2+2+0=0, max=2

Add (0,-1,1): (-1,1,0) cell4, occupied

So (-2,2,0)

Cell13: (-2,2,0)

Then from (-2,2,0), move? Add (-1,1,0): (-3,3,0) max=3

Add (-1,0,1): (-3,2,1) max=3

Add (0,-1,1): (-2,1,1) sum -2+1+1=0, max=2

Add (1,-1,0): (-1,1,0) occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (-1,2,-1) occupied

Add (0,1,-1): (-2,3,-1) max=3

So (-2,1,1)

Cell14: (-2,1,1)

Then from (-2,1,1), move? Add (-1,0,1): (-3,1,2) max=3

Add (0,-1,1): (-2,0,2) sum -2+0+2=0, max=2

Add (1,-1,0): (-1,0,1) cell5, occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (-1,1,0) occupied

Add (0,1,-1): (-2,2,0) cell13, occupied

Add (-1,1,0): (-3,2,1) max=3

So (-2,0,2)

Cell15: (-2,0,2)

Then from (-2,0,2), move? Add (0,-1,1): (-2,-1,3) max=3

Add (1,-1,0): (-1,-1,2) sum -1-1+2=0, max=2

Add (1,0,-1): (-1,0,1) occupied

Add (0,1,-1): (-2,1,1) occupied

Add (-1,1,0): (-3,1,2) max=3

Add (-1,0,1): (-3,0,3) max=3

So (-1,-1,2)

Cell16: (-1,-1,2)

Then from (-1,-1,2), move? Add (1,-1,0): (0,-2,2) sum 0-2+2=0, max=2

Add (0,-1,1): (-1,-2,3) max=3

Add (-1,0,1): (-2,-1,3) max=3

Add (-1,1,0): (-2,0,2) occupied

Add (0,1,-1): (-1,0,1) occupied

Add (1,0,-1): (0,-1,1) cell6, occupied

So (0,-2,2)

Cell17: (0,-2,2)

Then from (0,-2,2), move? Add (0,-1,1): (0,-3,3) max=3

Add (1,-1,0): (1,-3,2) max=3

Add (1,0,-1): (1,-2,1) sum 1-2+1=0, max=2

Add (0,1,-1): (0,-1,1) occupied

Add (-1,1,0): (-1,-1,2) occupied

Add (-1,0,1): (-1,-2,3) max=3

So (1,-2,1)

Cell18: (1,-2,1)

Then from (1,-2,1), move? Add (1,-1,0): (2,-3,1) max=3

Add (1,0,-1): (2,-2,0) sum 2-2+0=0, max=2

Add (0,1,-1): (1,-1,0) cell7, occupied

Add (-1,1,0): (0,-1,1) occupied

Add (-1,0,1): (0,-2,2) occupied

Add (0,-1,1): (1,-3,2) max=3

So (2,-2,0)

Cell19: (2,-2,0)

And that's the last cell of ring2, since 12 cells.

Now, from cell19 at (2,-2,0), to start ring3, move east: add (1,0,-1) to get (3,-2,-1), cell20.

Now, the end of the ring is at (k,-k,0) for k=2.

Start of ring is at (k, -k+1, -1)? For k=2, (2,-1,-1) for cell8.

Generalizing, for ring k, it starts at (k, -k+1, -1)? For k=1, (1,0,-1), which is (1,-1+1,-1)=(1,0,-1), yes.

For k=2, (2,-2+1,-1)=(2,-1,-1), yes, cell8.

Ends at (k, -k, 0)? For k=1, (1,-1,0), cell7, yes.

For k=2, (2,-2,0), cell19, yes.

Now, the starting direction: from start, it moves in which direction?

For ring k, start at (k, -k+1, -1)

Then first move: for k=1, from (1,0,-1) to (0,1,-1), vector (-1,1,0), which is northwest.

But in terms of direction, it's decreasing q, increasing r.

For k=2, from (2,-1,-1) to (2,0,-2), vector (0,1,-1), which is northeast? Earlier we called it NE.

The direction vectors for the moves.

In the ring, it moves along six sides, each in a constant direction.

For each side, it moves in one of the six directions for a certain number of steps.

For ring k, each side has k cells, but the first cell is shared or something? No, total cells 6k, and 6 sides, each with k cells, so each side has exactly k cells, including corners.

The direction sequence: typically, it moves in the order: NE, N, NW, W, SW, S.

For example, ring1: one cell per direction: NE: (0,1,-1) cell3? But start is (1,0,-1) cell2, then to (0,1,-1) cell3, which is NE direction? Vector (-1,1,0), which is NW if E is (1,0,-1).

To avoid confusion, let's define the direction of movement.

From the start, it moves in the direction that decreases q and increases s? Or something.

From start (k, -k+1, -1), it moves in the direction of vector (0,1,-1) for k>1? For k=2, from (2,-1,-1) to (2,0,-2), vector (0,1,-1)

For k=1, from (1,0,-1) to (0,1,-1), vector (-1,1,0), different.

For k=1 it's special.

For k>=2, it moves first in the (0,1,-1) direction for k-1 steps? For k=2, from (2,-1,-1) to (2,0,-2), which is one step, and k-1=1, yes.

Then after that, it changes direction.

After moving to (2,0,-2), then to (1,1,-2), vector (-1,1,0)

Then to (0,2,-2), vector (-1,1,0)? From (2,0,-2) to (1,1,-2): difference (-1,1,0)

From (1,1,-2) to (0,2,-2): difference (-1,1,0), same vector.

But for k=2, each side has 2 cells, but here from start to next is one cell in first direction, then two cells in next? Let's list the cells and vectors.

Ring k=2:

Start: cell8: (2,-1,-1)

Move to cell9: (2,0,-2), vector (0,1,-1)

Then move to cell10: (1,1,-2), vector (-1,1,0)

Then move to cell11: (0,2,-2), vector (-1,1,0)? From (1,1,-2) to (0,2,-2): difference (-1,1,0), same as before.

But then next is cell12: (-1,2,-1), from (0,2,-2) to (-1,2,-1): difference (-1,0,1)

Then to cell13: (-2,2,0), vector (-1,0,1)? Difference (-1,0,1), same.

From (-1,2,-1) to (-2,2,0): difference (-1,0,1)

Then to cell14: (-2,1,1), from (-2,2,0) to (-2,1,1): difference (0,-1,1)

Then to cell15: (-2,0,2), vector (0,-1,1)? Difference (0,-1,1)

From (-2,1,1) to (-2,0,2): difference (0,-1,1)

Then to cell16: (-1,-1,2), from (-2,0,2) to (-1,-1,2): difference (1,-1,0)

Then to cell17: (0,-2,2), vector (1,-1,0)? Difference (1,-1,0)

From (-1,-1,2) to (0,-2,2): difference (1,-1,0)

Then to cell18: (1,-2,1), from (0,-2,2) to (1,-2,1): difference (1,0,-1)

Then to cell19: (2,-2,0), vector (1,0,-1)? Difference (1,0,-1)

So the directions are: first vector (0,1,-1) for one step (from 8 to 9)

Then vector (-1,1,0) for two steps? From 9 to 10, 10 to 11? But 9 to 10 is (-1,1,0), 10 to 11 is also (-1,1,0), so two steps in that direction.

But each "side" should have k=2 cells, but here the first side has only one cell? Cell8 is the start, cell9 is the first move, but cell8 is included in the side.

The cells are assigned to sides.

From cell8 to cell9: direction (0,1,-1)

Cell9 to cell10: direction (-1,1,0)

Cell10 to cell11: direction (-1,1,0)? Same as previous? No, from 9 to 10 is (-1,1,0), from 10 to 11 is also (-1,1,0), but cell11 is the end of that side.

For the first side, cells 8 and 9 are in the first side, moving in direction (0,1,-1)? But from 8 to 9 is (0,1,-1), but cell9 is the last of the side, then it turns.

Typically, for a side, the cells are consecutive in the same direction.

For the first side of ring k, it has k cells, all with the same "direction" in the grid.

For example, in ring2, first side: cells 8 and 9? But they are at (2,-1,-1) and (2,0,-2), and the vector from 8 to 9 is (0,1,-1), but the side is not straight in that direction; it's only one step.

Perhaps the side is defined by the direction of the edge.

For ring k, the first side is in the "northeast" direction, cells from index 0 to k-1, with coordinates (k, -k+1 + i, -1 - i) for i=0 to k-1? For k=2, i=0: (2,-1,-1) cell8

i=1: (2,-1+1,-1-1)=(2,0,-2) cell9, yes.

Then next side: "north" or "northwest" direction.

From cell9 (2,0,-2), the next cell is 10 (1,1,-2), which is not in the same direction.

The next side should start at cell9 or cell10.

Cell9 is the last of first side, cell10 is first of next side.

For the second side, cells 10 and 11: (1,1,-2) and (0,2,-2)

Coordinates: for i=0: (1,1,-2), i=1: (0,2,-2)

Vector from 10 to 11: (-1,1,0)

General: (k - i, k - i +1, -k -1 + i)? For k=2, i=0: (2-0,2-0+1,-2-1+0)=(2,3,-3)? No.

Notice that from cell9 to cell10, it changes direction.

The general formula for the j-th side.

The six sides correspond to six directions.

The direction of movement for each side is constant.

For side m (m=0 to 5), the direction vector is fixed.

From the sequence, for ring k:

- Side 0: direction v0 = (0,1,-1)  // NE

Cells: for i=0 to k-1: start + i * v0

Start of side 0: (k, -k+1, -1)

For i=0: (k, -k+1, -1)

i=1: (k, -k+1 +1, -1 -1) = (k, -k+2, -2)

...

i=k-1: (k, -k+1 + (k-1), -1 - (k-1)) = (k, -1, -k)

For k=2: i=0: (2,-1,-1) cell8

i=1: (2,0,-2) cell9, good.

Then end of side 0 is (k, -1, -k)

Then start of side 1: next cell is (k-1, 0, -k)? For k=2, from (2,0,-2) to (1,1,-2), so (1,1,-2)

General: after moving in v0, the next direction is v1 = (-1,1,0)  // NW? 

Cells for side 1: start at (k, 0, -k)? But for k=2, (2,0,-2) is cell9, which is end of previous, so start of side 1 should be next cell, cell10: (1,1,-2)

So start of side 1: (k-1, 1, -k) ? For k=2, (1,1,-2)

Then direction v1 = (-1,1,0)

So cells: (k-1, 1, -k) + i * (-1,1,0) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (k-1,1,-k)

i=1: (k-2,2,-k)

...

i=k-1: (k-1 - (k-1), 1 + (k-1), -k) = (0,k,-k)

For k=2: i=0: (1,1,-2) cell10

i=1: (0,2,-2) cell11, good.

Then end at (0,k,-k)

Start of side 2: next cell, for k=2, cell12: (-1,2,-1)

General: after v1, next direction v2 = (-1,0,1)  // W? 

Start: (0,k,-k) + v2? From (0,k,-k) to next, vector v2=(-1,0,1)? Difference to (-1,k,-k+1)? But for k=2, (-1,2,-1), which is (-1,2,-1), so if v2=(-1,0,1), then from (0,k,-k) add (-1,0,1) = (-1,k,-k+1)

For k=2, (-1,2,-1), yes.

So start of side 2: (-1,k,-k+1)

Direction v2 = (-1,0,1)

Cells: (-1,k,-k+1) + i * (-1,0,1) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (-1,k,-k+1)

i=1: (-2,k,-k+2)

...

i=k-1: (-1 - (k-1), k, -k+1 + (k-1)) = (-k,k,0)

For k=2: i=0: (-1,2,-1) cell12

i=1: (-2,2,0) cell13, good.

End at (-k,k,0)

Start of side 3: next cell, for k=2, cell14: (-2,1,1)

General: from (-k,k,0) to next, vector? To (-k,k-1,1)? For k=2, (-2,1,1), so vector (0,-1,1)? Difference from (-2,2,0) to (-2,1,1) is (0,-1,1)

So v3 = (0,-1,1)  // SW?

Start: (-k,k,0) + v3? Add (0,-1,1) = (-k,k-1,1)

For k=2, (-2,1,1), yes.

Direction v3 = (0,-1,1)

Cells: (-k,k-1,1) + i * (0,-1,1) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (-k,k-1,1)

i=1: (-k,k-2,2)

...

i=k-1: (-k,k-1 - (k-1),1 + (k-1)) = (-k,0,k)

For k=2: i=0: (-2,1,1) cell14

i=1: (-2,0,2) cell15, good.

End at (-k,0,k)

Start of side 4: next cell, for k=2, cell16: (-1,-1,2)

General: from (-k,0,k) to next, vector? To (-k+1,-1,k)? For k=2, (-1,-1,2), so vector (1,-1,0)? Difference from (-2,0,2) to (-1,-1,2) is (1,-1,0)

So v4 = (1,-1,0)  // S? or SE?

Start: (-k,0,k) + v4? Add (1,-1,0) = (-k+1,-1,k)

For k=2, (-1,-1,2), yes.

Direction v4 = (1,-1,0)

Cells: (-k+1,-1,k) + i * (1,-1,0) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (-k+1,-1,k)

i=1: (-k+2,-2,k)

...

i=k-1: (-k+1 + (k-1), -1 - (k-1), k) = (0,-k,k)

For k=2: i=0: (-1,-1,2) cell16

i=1: (0,-2,2) cell17, good.

End at (0,-k,k)

Start of side 5: next cell, for k=2, cell18: (1,-2,1)

General: from (0,-k,k) to next, vector? To (1,-k,-k+1)? For k=2, (1,-2,1), so vector (1,0,-1)? Difference from (0,-2,2) to (1,-2,1) is (1,0,-1)

So v5 = (1,0,-1)  // E

Start: (0,-k,k) + v5? Add (1,0,-1) = (1,-k,k-1)

For k=2, (1,-2,1), yes.

Direction v5 = (1,0,-1)

Cells: (1,-k,k-1) + i * (1,0,-1) for i=0 to k-1

i=0: (1,-k,k-1)

i=1: (2,-k,k-2)

...

i=k-1: (1 + (k-1), -k, k-1 - (k-1)) = (k,-k,0)

For k=2: i=0: (1,-2,1) cell18

i=1: (2,-2,0) cell19, good.

End at (k,-k,0)

And this matches the end point we had.

Now, for each side, the cells are covered.

The index within the ring: total cells per side is k, so side m has cells from m*k to (m+1)*k - 1, but starting from index 0.

For ring k, cells numbered from F(k) to L(k), with F(k) = 2 + 3k(k-1) as before.

The position in ring: let p = n - F(k) + 1, so p from 1 to 6k.

Then the side index s = floor((p-1)/k) , so s=0,1,2,3,4,5.

Then within side, index i = (p-1) mod k, from 0 to k-1.

Then coordinates depend on s and i.

From above:

For side s=0: direction v0=(0,1,-1)

Start: (k, -k+1, -1)

Cells: (k, -k+1 + i, -1 - i)

Since adding i*v0 = i*(0,1,-1) = (0,i,-i), so (k, -k+1 + i, -1 - i)

For s=1: v1=(-1,1,0)

Start: (k-1, 1, -k) ? Earlier we had start of side 1: (k-1,1,-k)

Cells: (k-1 - i, 1 + i, -k) ? Adding i*v1 = i*(-1,1,0) = (-i,i,0), so (k-1 - i, 1 + i, -k)

But -k is constant? For k=2, i=0: (1,1,-2), i=1: (0,2,-2), yes, s-coordinate is -k, constant.

In cube coordinates, s is determined by q and r, since s=-q-r.

In this case, for side 1, s = -q - r = - (k-1 - i) - (1 + i) = -k +1 + i -1 - i = -k, yes constant.

Similarly for others.

So:

s=0: q = k, r = -k+1 + i, s = -1 - i  (but s=-q-r, so consistent)

s=1: q = k-1 - i, r = 1 + i, s = -k  (since -q-r = -(k-1-i) - (1+i) = -k +1 + i -1 - i = -k)

s=2: v2=(-1,0,1), start: (-1,k,-k+1)? Earlier for s=2: start (-1,k,-k+1)

Cells: (-1 - i, k, -k+1 + i) ? Adding i*v2 = i*(-1,0,1) = (-i,0,i), so q= -1 - i, r= k, s= -k+1 + i

Then -q-r = -(-1-i) - k = 1+i -k, but s should be -k+1+i, yes same.

s=3: v3=(0,-1,1), start: (-k,k-1,1)

Cells: (-k, k-1 - i, 1 + i) ? Adding i*v3 = i*(0,-1,1) = (0,-i,i), so q= -k, r= k-1 - i, s= 1 + i

s=4: v4=(1,-1,0), start: (-k+1,-1,k)

Cells: (-k+1 + i, -1 - i, k) ? Adding i*v4 = i*(1,-1,0) = (i,-i,0), so q= -k+1 + i, r= -1 - i, s= k

s=5: v5=(1,0,-1), start: (1,-k,k-1)

Cells: (1 + i, -k, k-1 - i) ? Adding i*v5 = i*(1,0,-1) = (i,0,-i), so q=1+i, r=-k, s=k-1 - i

Now, for a given n, in ring k, p = n - F(k) + 1

s = floor((p-1)/k)

i = (p-1) mod k

Then coordinates (q,r,s) as above.

But s is determined by q and r, so we can compute q and r.

Now for n=2026, k=26, F(k)=1952

p = 2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75? 2026 - 1952 = 74, so p=74 +1=75? n - F(k) +1 = 2026 - 1952 +1 = 75

F(k)=1952, so first cell is 1952, so p=1 for n=1952, p=2 for 1953, ..., p=75 for 2026.

Since ring has 156 cells, p from 1 to 156.

s = floor((p-1)/k) = floor(74/26) = floor(2.846...) = 2? Since 26*2=52, 26*3=78>74, so s=2? floor((75-1)/26)=floor(74/26)=2 since 26*2=52 <=74<78=26*3.

i = (p-1) mod k = 74 mod 26.

74 divided by 26: 26*2=52, 74-52=22, so i=22.

Now s=2, i=22.

For s=2: q = -1 - i, r = k, s_coord = -k +1 + i? Earlier for s=2: q = -1 - i, r = k, s = -k +1 + i

k=26, i=22.

So q = -1 - 22 = -23

r = 26

s = -26 +1 + 22 = -3? But s should be -q - r = -(-23) - 26 = 23 - 26 = -3, yes.

So coordinates: (q,r,s) = (-23, 26, -3)

Now, I need the six neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors are obtained by adding the six direction vectors:

d1: (1,-1,0)

d2: (1,0,-1)

d3: (0,1,-1)

d4: (-1,1,0)

d5: (-1,0,1)

d6: (0,-1,1)

So neighbors:

N1: (-23 +1, 26 -1, -3 +0) = (-22,25,-3)

N2: (-23+1,26+0,-3-1)=(-22,26,-4)

N3: (-23+0,26+1,-3-1)=(-23,27,-4)

N4: (-23-1,26+1,-3+0)=(-24,27,-3)

N5: (-23-1,26+0,-3+1)=(-24,26,-2)

N6: (-23+0,26-1,-3+1)=(-23,25,-2)

Each neighbor must satisfy q+r+s=0, which they do: for example N1: -22+25-3=0, etc.

Now, each neighbor is at some distance from center, and we need to find the number assigned to it.

The distance d = max(|q|,|r|,|s|)

For N1: (-22,25,-3), max(22,25,3)=25

N2: (-22,26,-4), max(22,26,4)=26

N3: (-23,27,-4), max(23,27,4)=27

N4: (-24,27,-3), max(24,27,3)=27

N5: (-24,26,-2), max(24,26,2)=26

N6: (-23,25,-2), max(23,25,2)=25

So neighbors are at distances 25,26,27.

Specifically: N1 and N6 at d=25, N2 and N5 at d=26, N3 and N4 at d=27.

Now, since d=25,26,27, and ring k corresponds to distance k, so ring 25,26,27.

Now, we need to find the number for each neighbor.

To find the number, we need to find its position in its ring.

That is, for a cell at (q,r,s) with d=max(|q|,|r|,|s|), it is in ring d.

Then we need to find its index in the ring.

Similar to before, but now we have coordinates, need to find which side and which i.

So for each neighbor, compute d, then find s and i for that ring.

First, neighbor N1: (-22,25,-3), d=max(22,25,3)=25, so ring 25.

Now, coordinates q=-22, r=25, s=-3.

Since d=25, and |r|=25, which is max, and r>0, so it's on the "top" or something.

To find the side and index.

From the earlier side definitions, depending on which direction it's facing.

We can use the same side definitions as before.

For ring d, the sides are defined similarly.

Now, for a given (q,r,s), with d=max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=25.

Now, since r=25, and d=25, |r|=d, and r>0, so it might be on side s=1 or s=2? Earlier sides were defined by the start.

Note that for each side, the coordinates satisfy certain inequalities.

Since we have the coordinates, we can compute the side based on which coordinate is maximal and the sign.

In this case, r=25, which is positive and maximal (since |r|=25, |q|=22<25, |s|=3<25), so it's on the side where r is maximal.

Looking back at the sides:

For ring d, side s=0: q=d, r varies, s varies, but |q|=d, and since q=d>0, and r and s smaller.

In s=0: q=d, r from -d+1 to -1? Earlier for s=0: q=k, r= -k+1 + i, i=0 to k-1, so r from -k+1 to -k+1 + (k-1) = -k+1 + k -1 =0? For k=25, r from -25+1=-24 to 0? But in our case r=25>0, not matching.

s=1: q=k-1 - i, r=1+i, so q from k-1 down to 0, r from 1 to k.

Since i=0 to k-1, q=k-1,k-2,...,0, r=1,2,...,k.

And since |r|=r=k when i=k-1, but |q| may be less.

In this case, for N1, r=25, d=25, so r=d=25.

In s=1, r=1+i, so when r=d, i=d-1.

q=k-1 - i =25-1 - (25-1)=24-24=0? k=d=25.

q= k-1 - i =25-1 - (25-1)=24-24=0

But our q=-22, not 0. Contradiction.

s=2: q= -1 - i, r=k, so r=d=25, q= -1 - i, i=0 to k-1, so q from -1 to -k.

In this case, r=k=25, q= -1 - i, so since |q|=| -1 -i |, but since i>=0, q<0, so |q|=1+i.

d=max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=max(1+i, k, |s|)

But k=25, and |s|=|-k+1+i|=| -25+1+i|=|-24+i|, since i<25, | -24+i| <=24<25, so d=max(1+i,25, |s|) <= max(25,25,24)=25, and since r=k=25, d>=25, so d=25, good.

Now |q|=1+i, which must be <=25, so i<=24.

In our case, |q|=22, so 1+i=22? |q|=22, q=-22, so |q|=22=1+i, so i=21.

Then r=k=25.

s= -k+1+i= -25+1+21= -3, which matches our s_coord=-3.

Perfect.

So for N1: ring d=25, side s=2? In our earlier, for ring k, side s=2 is the third side.

s=2: q= -1 - i, r=k, s= -k+1+i

With i=21, k=25.

Now, the index in the ring.

p = ? First, side index s=2.

Then within side, i=21.

Now, the ring starts at F(d), with d=25.

F(25)=2 + 3*25*24=2+3*600=2+1800=1802

The position: for side s, the starting index in ring.

Sides are s=0,1,2,3,4,5.

Each side has k cells.

So the start of side s is at position s*k +1 in the ring? Since p from 1 to 6k.

For example, ring k=2, side s=0: cells 8,9 → p=1,2? n=8,9, F=8, so p=1,2 for s=0.

s=1: cells 10,11 → p=3,4

s=2:12,13→p=5,6

s=3:14,15→p=7,8

s=4:16,17→p=9,10

s=5:18,19→p=11,12

So for side s, the p indices are from s*k +1 to (s+1)*k

For s=0: 0*2+1=1 to 2*1? (s+1)k =1*2=2, yes p=1,2

s=1:1*2+1=3 to 2*2=4? (s+1)k=2*2=4, yes p=3,4

s=2:2*2+1=5 to 3*2=6, p=5,6

etc.

So in general, for side s, p ranges from s*k +1 to (s+1)*k

And within side, i from 0 to k-1, and p = s*k +1 + i

Since i=0: p=s*k+1, i=1: p=s*k+2, ..., i=k-1: p=s*k + k = (s+1)k

Yes.

So for given s and i, p = s*k + 1 + i

Then n = F(d) + p - 1 = F(d) + s*k + i

Since p = s*k + 1 + i, so n = F(d) + (s*k + 1 + i) - 1 = F(d) + s*k + i

Now for N1: d=25, s_side=2? In our case, we have s=2 for the side index.

In the coordinate, we used s=2, which corresponds to the third side, index s=2.

k=d=25, s=2, i=21

F(25)=1802

So n_N1 = 1802 + 2*25 + 21 = 1802 + 50 + 21 = 1873

Compute: 1802 + 50 = 1852, +21=1873.

Now, similarly for other neighbors.

But we have six neighbors, and we need to compute each.

Now N2: (-22,26,-4), d=max(22,26,4)=26, ring 26.

q=-22, r=26, s=-4.

d=26, |r|=26=d, r>0.

Similar to before, probably on side where r=d.

From earlier, for ring k, when r=k, it could be on side s=1 or s=2.

s=1: r=1+i, so r=k when i=k-1, q=k-1 - i =k-1 - (k-1)=0

But here q=-22 ≠0.

s=2: r=k, q= -1 - i

Here r=26, so k=26? d=k=26.

r=k=26, q= -1 - i = -22? So -1 - i = -22 ⇒ i=21

s_coord= -k +1 + i = -26 +1 +21= -4, matches.

So side s=2, i=21, k=26.

F(26)=1952, as before.

n_N2 = F(k) + s*k + i = 1952 + 2*26 + 21 = 1952 + 52 + 21

1952+52=2004, +21=2025.

2025, which is close to 2026.

Now N3: (-23,27,-4), d=max(23,27,4)=27, ring 27.

q=-23, r=27, s=-4.

d=27, |r|=27=d, r>0.

On side with r=k? k=d=27.

s=2: r=k=27, q= -1 - i = -23? So -1 - i = -23 ⇒ i=22

s_coord= -k +1 + i = -27 +1 +22= -4, matches.

So s=2, i=22, k=27.

F(27)=2 + 3*27*26=2+3*702=2+2106=2108

n_N3=2108 + 2*27 + 22=2108 + 54 + 22=2108+76=2184

Now N4: (-24,27,-3), d=max(24,27,3)=27, ring 27.

q=-24, r=27, s=-3.

d=27, |r|=27=d, r>0.

s=2: r=k=27, q= -1 - i = -24? So -1 - i = -24 ⇒ i=23

s_coord= -27 +1 +23= -3? -27+1=-26, +23=-3, yes.

So s=2, i=23, k=27.

n_N4= F(27) + s*k + i = 2108 + 2*27 + 23=2108 + 54 + 23=2108+77=2185

Now N5: (-24,26,-2), d=max(24,26,2)=26, ring 26.

q=-24, r=26, s=-2.

d=26, |r|=26=d, r>0.

s=2: r=k=26, q= -1 - i = -24? So -1 - i = -24 ⇒ i=23

s_coord= -26 +1 +23= -2? -26+1=-25, +23=-2, yes.

So s=2, i=23, k=26.

n_N5= F(26) + s*k + i = 1952 + 2*26 + 23=1952 + 52 + 23=1952+75=2027

1952+52=2004, +23=2027.

Now N6: (-23,25,-2), d=max(23,25,2)=25, ring 25.

q=-23, r=25, s=-2.

d=25, |r|=25=d, r>0.

s=2: r=k=25, q= -1 - i = -23? So -1 - i = -23 ⇒ i=22

s_coord= -25 +1 +22= -2? -25+1=-24, +22=-2, yes.

So s=2, i=22, k=25.

n_N6= F(25) + s*k + i = 1802 + 2*25 + 22=1802 + 50 + 22=1802+72=1874

Now, summarize the neighbors' numbers:

N1: 1873

N2: 2025

N3: 2184

N4: 2185

N5: 2027

N6: 1874

Now sum: 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874

Compute step by step.

First, N1 and N6: 1873 + 1874 = 3747

N2 and N5: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

N3 and N4: 2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now sum these: 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Add carefully: 7799 + 4000 = 11799, +369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, +69 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a small example.

For example, take number 1 at center.

Neighbors are 2,3,4,5,6,7, sum=27.

According to formula, for n=1, ring k=0? But ring 0 is only center, neighbors are ring 1.

In our method, for n=1, but we assumed ring k>=1, so need to handle center separately, but here n=2026 is not center.

Another example: say n=2, at (1,0,-1)

Neighbors: as computed earlier: (2,-1,-1),(2,0,-2),(1,1,-2),(0,1,-1),(0,0,0),(1,-1,0)

Which are cells: (2,-1,-1) is cell8? For ring2.

(2,0,-2) cell9

(1,1,-2) cell10? Ring2

(0,1,-1) cell3, ring1

(0,0,0) cell1, center

(1,-1,0) cell7, ring1

So neighbors: 8,9,10,3,1,7

Sum: 8+9+10+3+1+7=38

But according to our calculation, for n=2, k=1, F(1)=2, p=1 (since first cell)

s=floor((1-1)/1)=floor(0/1)=0

i=(1-1) mod 1=0

Coordinates: s=0, k=1, q=k=1, r=-k+1+i=-1+1+0=0, s=-1-i=-1-0=-1? So (1,0,-1), good.

Neighbors: as above.

But in our sum, we have numbers, but for center, we need to handle it.

In this case, neighbors include center and other rings.

But for n=2026, all neighbors are in higher or same ring, no center, so should be fine.

Now for n=2026, we computed neighbors: 1873,2025,2184,2185,2027,1874

Notice that N2=2025, N5=2027, which are adjacent to 2026, and 2025,2026,2027 are consecutive? But in the spiral, not necessarily consecutive, but here they are close.

Sum we have 12168.

But let me confirm if the coordinates are correct.

Original cell: n=2026, k=26, s=2, i=22, q=-23, r=26, s=-3

Neighbors:

N1: (-22,25,-3) d=25

N2: (-22,26,-4) d=26

N3: (-23,27,-4) d=27

N4: (-24,27,-3) d=27

N5: (-24,26,-2) d=26

N6: (-23,25,-2) d=25

Now for each, we computed the number.

For N1: d=25, s_side=2, i=21, n=1873

Similarly for others.

Now, is there any neighbor that might be in a different side? For example, N6: (-23,25,-2), d=25, |r|=25=d, r>0, |q|=23<25, |s|=2<25, so should be on s=2, as we did.

Similarly for others.

Now sum: 1873 + 2025 + 2184 + 2185 + 2027 + 1874

Add in pairs:

1873 + 1874 = 3747

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168, as before.

Note that 2025 and 2027 are symmetric, sum 4052.

1873 and 1874 are consecutive? 1874 - 1873=1, so consecutive numbers.

Similarly, 2184 and 2185 are consecutive.

So sum is 1873+1874 + 2025+2027 + 2184+2185 = (1873+1874) + (2025+2027) + (2184+2185)

= 3747 + 4052 + 4369

3747 + 4052: 3700+4000=7700, 47+52=99, total 7799

7799 + 4369: 7799 + 4000 = 11799, 11799 + 369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, +69=12168.

7799 + 4369: 7800 -1 + 4369 = 7800 + 4369 -1 = 12169 -1 = 12168.

So sum is 12168.

Now, is this the answer? But let me confirm with another point.

Take n=8, at (2,-1,-1), ring k=2.

F(2)=8, p=1 (first cell)

s=floor((1-1)/2)=floor(0/2)=0

i=0

Coordinates: s=0, k=2, q=k=2, r=-k+1+i=-2+1+0=-1, s=-1-i=-1-0=-1? So (2,-1,-1)

Neighbors:

Add vectors:

(2,-1,-1) + (1,-1,0) = (3,-2,-1) d=max(3,2,1)=3, ring3

+ (1,0,-1) = (3,-1,-2) d=3

+ (0,1,-1) = (2,0,-2) d=2, same ring? But (2,0,-2) is cell9, adjacent.

+ (-1,1,0) = (1,0,-1) d=1, ring1, cell2? But cell2 is (1,0,-1)

+ (-1,0,1) = (1,-1,0) d=1, cell7

+ (0,-1,1) = (2,-2,0) d=2, cell19? But adjacent.

So neighbors: (3,-2,-1), (3,-1,-2), (2,0,-2), (1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (2,-2,0)

Numbers: (3,-2,-1) is in ring3, which starts at F(3)=2+3*3*2=2+18=20? Ring3:20 to 1+3*3*4=1+36=37? Size 18.

But (3,-2,-1), d=3, |q|=3=d, q>0.

On side s=0? s=0: q=k=3, r=-k+1+i=-3+1+i=-2+i, s=-1-i

Set q=3, r=-2+i, s=-1-i

But r=-2+i, s=-1-i, and q=3.

In our case, r=-2, s=-1? So -2+i = -2 ⇒ i=0? Then s=-1-0=-1, so (3,-2,-1)

Side s=0, i=0, k=3.

F(3)=20? Earlier I said 20, but compute: F(k)=2+3k(k-1), k=3, 2+3*3*2=2+18=20.

n= F(k) + s*k + i =20 + 0*3 +0=20

Similarly, (3,-1,-2): q=3, r=-1, s=-2? |q|=3=d, q>0.

s=0: r=-k+1+i=-3+1+i=-2+i, set -2+i=-1 ⇒ i=1

s=-1-i=-1-1=-2, yes.

So s=0, i=1, n=20 + 0*3 +1=21

(2,0,-2): d=max(2,0,2)=2, ring2.

q=2,r=0,s=-2? |q|=2,|s|=2,d=2.

Now which side? Possible s=0: q=k=2,r=-k+1+i=-2+1+i=-1+i, set -1+i=0? i=1, s=-1-i=-1-1=-2, yes. So (2,0,-2), s=0,i=1,k=2.

n= F(2) + s*k + i =8 + 0*2 +1=9

(1,0,-1): d=1, ring1, q=1,r=0,s=-1? Side s=0: q=k=1,r=-1+1+i=i, set i=0? r=0, s=-1-i=-1, so (1,0,-1), s=0,i=0? But ring1 side0 is cell2, yes n=2? F(1)=2, s=0,i=0, n=2+0*1+0=2

(1,-1,0): d=1, q=1,r=-1,s=0? Side s=5? s=5: q=1+i,r=-k,s=k-1-i? k=1, q=1+i,r=-1,s=1-1-i=-i

Set q=1,r=-1,s=0? So 1+i=1 ⇒ i=0, s=-0=0, yes. Side s=5? For ring1, s=5: q=1+i,r=-1,s=-i? i=0: (1,-1,0), yes. n= F(1)+s*k+i=2+5*1+0=7? But should be cell7. Yes.

(2,-2,0): d=2, q=2,r=-2,s=0? Side s=5? s=5: q=1+i,r=-k,s=k-1-i? k=2, q=1+i,r=-2,s=2-1-i=1-i

Set r=-2, q=1+i, s=1-i

q=2, so 1+i=2 ⇒ i=1, s=1-1=0, yes. n= F(2)+s*k+i=8+5*2+1=8+10+1=19? Cell19, yes.

So neighbors: 20,21,9,2,7,19

Sum: 20+21=41, 9+2=11, 7+19=26, total 41+11=52, +26=78.

But earlier I thought neighbors of 8 are 9,10,3,1,7,19? But according to adjacency, the neighbors we computed are (3,-2,-1)=20, (3,-1,-2)=21, (2,0,-2)=9, (1,0,-1)=2, (1,-1,0)=7, (2,-2,0)=19.

But in the grid, is (2,0,-2) adjacent to (2,-1,-1)? Difference (0,1,-1), which is a direction vector, yes.

Similarly, (1,0,-1) to (2,-1,-1): difference (-1,1,0)? From (2,-1,-1) to (1,0,-1): (1-2,0-(-1),-1-(-1))=(-1,1,0), yes direction vector.

Similarly others.

But in the spiral, cell 10 is (1,1,-2), which is adjacent? From (2,-1,-1) to (1,1,-2): difference (-1,2,-1), not a direction vector, so not adjacent. Indeed, in hex grid, not adjacent.

So neighbors are only the adjacent cells, which are as computed: 20,21,9,2,7,19.

Sum 20+21+9+2+7+19= let's see: 20+21=41, 9+2=11, 7+19=26, 41+11=52, 52+26=78.

Now, actual neighbors: since 8 is at corner, but sum is 78.

Now back to our problem, we have sum 12168 for n=2026.

Now, is there a pattern or simpler way? But since we computed, and it seems consistent, probably correct.

Notice that for our cell, it is on the side s=2, and i=22, k=26.

The neighbors: two at same ring: N2 and N5, at d=26.

N2: at (q,r,s)=(-22,26,-4), which is same ring, and we computed s_side=2, i=21

Similarly N5: (-24,26,-2), s_side=2, i=23

In the same ring, same side, but different i.

The other neighbors are in adjacent rings.

But anyway, we have the numbers.

Sum is 12168.

So the answer should be 12168.

But let me write it down.

Neighbors:

N1: 1873

N2: 2025

N3: 2184

N4: 2185

N5: 2027

N6: 1874

Sum: 1873 + 1874 = 3747

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

As a check: average neighbor might be around 2026, but since two are smaller, two larger, two much larger.

1873 and 1874 are about 200 less, sum about 400 less.

2025 and 2027 are very close, sum 4052, while 2026*2=4052, exactly.

2184 and 2185 sum 4369, average about 2184.5, while 2026 is center, so difference.

Total sum: the two close neighbors sum 4052, which is exactly 2*2026.

The other four: 1873+1874+2184+2185.

1873+2185=4060? 1873+2185=4058? 1800+2100=3900, 73+85=158, total 4058.

1874+2184=1874+2184=4058? 1800+2100=3900, 74+84=158, total 4058.

So 4058 + 4058 = 8116? But that's for four numbers.

1873+1874+2184+2185 = (1873+2185) + (1874+2184) = 4058 + 4058 = 8116

Then total sum: 8116 + 4052 = 12168, same.

Now 8116 + 4052 = 12168.

So yes.

Therefore, the sum is 12168.

The number 2026 is located in ring 26 of the hexagonal spiral, which contains numbers from 1952 to 2107. The coordinates of 2026 in cube coordinates are \((-23, 26, -3)\).

The six neighbors of this cell are found by adding the direction vectors to the coordinates:
- \((-22, 25, -3)\)
- \((-22, 26, -4)\)
- \((-23, 27, -4)\)
- \((-24, 27, -3)\)
- \((-24, 26, -2)\)
- \((-23, 25, -2)\)

The distance (ring) of each neighbor is determined by the maximum absolute value of its coordinates:
- \((-22, 25, -3)\) is in ring 25
- \((-22, 26, -4)\) is in ring 26
- \((-23, 27, -4)\) is in ring 27
- \((-24, 27, -3)\) is in ring 27
- \((-24, 26, -2)\) is in ring 26
- \((-23, 25, -2)\) is in ring 25

The number assigned to each neighbor is found by determining its position within its ring:
- For ring 25, starting number is 1802. The neighbor \((-22, 25, -3)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 21\), so its number is \(1802 + 2 \times 25 + 21 = 1873\).
- For ring 26, starting number is 1952. The neighbor \((-22, 26, -4)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 21\), so its number is \(1952 + 2 \times 26 + 21 = 2025\).
- For ring 27, starting number is 2108. The neighbor \((-23, 27, -4)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 22\), so its number is \(2108 + 2 \times 27 + 22 = 2184\).
- For ring 27, starting number is 2108. The neighbor \((-24, 27, -3)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 23\), so its number is \(2108 + 2 \times 27 + 23 = 2185\).
- For ring 26, starting number is 1952. The neighbor \((-24, 26, -2)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 23\), so its number is \(1952 + 2 \times 26 + 23 = 2027\).
- For ring 25, starting number is 1802. The neighbor \((-23, 25, -2)\) is on side 2 with index \(i = 22\), so its number is \(1802 + 2 \times 25 + 22 = 1874\).

The neighbors are 1873, 2025, 2184, 2185, 2027, and 1874. Their sum is calculated as:
- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(2184 + 2185 = 4369\)
- \(3747 + 4052 = 7799\)
- \(7799 + 4369 = 12168\)

Thus, the sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is 12168.

\boxed{12168}
