<think>
The problem involves a hexagonal grid with natural numbers arranged in a spiral. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out on the hex grid.

From the snippet:

```
... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

It seems like the center is 1, and then it spirals outwards. Let me sketch this out.

Assume that 1 is at the center. Then, looking at the neighbors: directly above might be 5? The grid shows:

Row 1: ... 14  4  3  10 ...

Row 2: .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...

Row 3: ... 16  6  7  8 ...

This might be offset. Probably, it's aligned such that each row is shifted.

In a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors. The numbers given are around 1: 5,2, and below 6,7,8, and above 4,3,10? It's messy.

Notice that 1 is surrounded by 2,5,6,7,8? But 3 and 4 are also nearby. Let me list the numbers around 1.

Directly to the right of 1 is 2. Below-right is 8? The grid shows:

In row 2: 15,5,1,2,9

In row 3: 16,6,7,8

In row 1: 14,4,3,10

So, below 1 is 6? Because row 3 has 6,7,8, and row 2 has 1,2, so probably below 1 is 6.

Then below-right is 7? Below-left is 5? But 5 is in the same row as 1.

This is confusing. Perhaps the grid is arranged in axial coordinates or something.

I recall that hexagonal grids can be represented with two axes, often called q and r, with s = -q - r, but that might be overkill.

Perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for the spiral.

Let me try to map out the spiral starting from 1.

Start at center: position (0,0), number 1.

Then, probably moves to the right to 2.

Then, since it's a spiral, it might go clockwise or counterclockwise.

From 1 to 2 is right. Then to 3? But in the grid, 3 is above-right? The sequence might be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...

But in the grid, after 2 is 9? No, the grid shows 1,2,9 in row 2, but row 1 has 3,4,14, etc.

Perhaps the next number after 1 is 2, then it turns to below or something.

Look at the neighbors of 1: from the grid, 1 is adjacent to 2 (right), 5 (left? but 5 is left in row), 6 (below? since row 3 has 6 below 1?).

Assuming that the grid is aligned such that row 2 has cells at y=0: say 15,5,1,2,9

Row 3 at y=1: 16,6,7,8

Row 1 at y=-1: 14,4,3,10

Now, for a hexagonal grid, neighbors depend on whether the row is even or odd, but here it seems consistent.

Typically, for a hex grid with flat tops, neighbors are: (0,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1) or something. I need to define coordinates.

Set the center 1 at (0,0).

Assume that moving right increases x, moving down-right increases y, etc.

From 1 at (0,0), to the right is 2 at (1,0).

Then, below-right might be 8? But in row 3, which is below, we have 6,7,8, and 6 is directly below 1? If row 3 is y=1, and row 2 is y=0, then cell below 1 should be at (0,1).

In row 3, we have 16,6,7,8. Since row 2 has 1 at some x, say x=0 for 1, then below it should be at x=0, y=1, which is 6.

So 6 is directly below 1.

Then to the right of 6 is 7, then 8.

Above 1, in row 1 (y=-1), we have 14,4,3,10. If 1 is at x=0, then above should be at x=0,y=-1, which is 4? The grid shows 14,4,3,10, so probably 4 is at (0,-1).

Then left of 4 is 3? But 3 is at what x? The sequence is 14,4,3,10, so if 4 is at (0,-1), then left might be 3 at (-1,-1), but in hex grid, neighbors should be symmetric.

List the neighbors of 1.

From the grid:

- Right: 2 at (1,0)

- Below: 6 at (0,1) ? Assuming y increases down.

- Below-right: 7 at (1,1)? Since below 1 is 6 at (0,1), and right of that is 7 at (1,1), which should be below-right of 1.

- Below-left: ? At (-1,1)? In row 3, left of 6 is 16? But 16 is listed first, so probably at (-1,1) is 16.

But is 16 adjacent to 1? In hex grid, distance from (0,0) to (-1,1) is |0-(-1)| + |0-1| + |0+1-0|? The Manhattan distance in hex grid is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|) but usually it's |dx| + |dy| for axial, but let's calculate.

In axial coordinates, distance between (q1,r1) and (q2,r2) is (|dq| + |dr| + |ds|)/2 where s= -q-r, but standard formula is max(|dq|, |dr|, |ds|).

Distance is max( |q1-q2|, |r1-r2|, |s1-s2| ) where s = -q-r.

For (0,0) and (-1,1), s1 = -0-0=0, s2 = -(-1)-1 =1-1=0, so |q| =1, |r|=1, |s|=0, max is 1, so yes, adjacent.

Similarly, (0,0) and (1,0): |q|=1, |r|=0, |s|=1, max=1, adjacent.

(0,0) and (0,1): |q|=0, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=1, adjacent.

(0,0) and (1,1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=2? s1=0, s2=-1-1=-2, |s|=2, max=2, not adjacent. Oh, so (1,1) is not adjacent to (0,0).

I think I have the coordinate system wrong.

In a hex grid, for a cell at (q,r), neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1), or something like that.

Standard axial neighbors: the six neighbors are:

- (q+1, r)

- (q, r+1)

- (q-1, r+1)

- (q-1, r)

- (q, r-1)

- (q+1, r-1)

Yes.

Now, distance between (q,r) and (q',r') is (|q-q'| + |r-r'| + |s-s'|)/2 where s= -q-r, s'= -q'-r', and since |q-q'| + |r-r'| + |s-s'| is even, and distance is half of that.

For (0,0) and (1,0): |1-0| + |0-0| + | -1-0| =1+0+1=2, distance 1, adjacent.

(0,0) and (0,1): |0| + |1| + | -0-1 -0| =0+1+1=2, distance 1.

(0,0) and (1,1): |1| + |1| + | -1-1 -0| =1+1+2=4, distance 2, not adjacent.

(0,0) and (-1,1): | -1-0| + |1-0| + | -(-1)-1 -0| =1+1+|1-1-0|=1+1+0=2, distance 1, adjacent.

(0,0) and (-1,0): | -1| + |0| + |1-0| =1+0+1=2, distance 1.

(0,0) and (0,-1): |0| + |-1| + |1-0| =0+1+1=2, distance 1.

(0,0) and (1,-1): |1| + |-1| + | -1+1 -0| =1+1+0=2, distance 1.

So all six are adjacent.

Now in our grid, for 1 at (0,0), we have:

- Right: 2 at (1,0)

- Below: 6 at (0,1)? But let's see what is at (0,1).

From row 3: 16,6,7,8. If this is y=1, and x increases, and 1 is at x=0,y=0, then below should be x=0,y=1, which is 6.

- Below-right: should be (1,1), which is 7, since right of 6 is 7.

- Below-left: (-1,1), which is 16, since left of 6 is 16.

- Above: (0,-1), which from row 1: 14,4,3,10. If y=-1, and 1 is at x=0, then (0,-1) should be 4.

- Above-left: (-1,-1)? What is there? In row 1, left of 4 is 3? But 3 is listed before 4? The sequence is 14,4,3,10, so if it's from left to right, 14 at left, then 4, then 3, then 10. But if y=-1, and x increases, then if 4 is at (0,-1), then left might be 3 at (-1,-1), and right 10 at (1,-1)? But 10 is after 3, so probably x increases to the right.

So assume for row y=-1: x= -2:14? Or what? The dots suggest it's not full, but let's see the values.

At (0,-1): 4

At (-1,-1): 3? Since 3 is left of 4 in the list.

At (1,-1): 10? Since after 3 is 10, but 3 is at (-1,-1), then next is 10 at (1,-1)? That skips (0,-1), but (0,-1) is 4, which is listed between 14 and 3? The list is 14,4,3,10, so probably the order is not monotonic in x.

Perhaps the rows are offset. In hex grids, often rows are shifted.

For example, in row y=0: cells at x even or odd.

In this case, for y=0, we have 15,5,1,2,9. So likely x from left to right: say x=-2:15, x=-1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9.

For y=1: 16,6,7,8. If no offset, x=-2:16? But 16 is there, x=-1:6, x=0:7? But earlier we said below 1 should be at (0,1), which would be x=0,y=1, but here if y=1, x=0 is 7? But we thought it should be 6. Inconsistency.

Perhaps with offset. In standard hex grid, for even rows, x even, for odd rows x odd, or vice versa.

Assume that for each y, x ranges over integers, but the grid is staggered.

Typically, for flat-top hexagons, when y is even, x even, when y odd, x odd, or something. But here, at y=0, we have cells at x= -2,-1,0,1,2, all integers, so probably no parity constraint.

But then at (0,1), it should be below (0,0), but in the list, at y=1, x=0 is 7, but we need it to be 6 for below 1.

Unless the numbering is different.

Let's list the positions based on the given numbers.

From the grid, 1 is at some position.

To the right of 1 is 2.

Below and right is 8? But 8 is in row 3, and 7 is left of 8, 6 left of 7, and 6 is below 5? But 5 is left of 1 in row 2.

Perhaps 6 is below 1, but in the list, in row 3, it's 16,6,7,8, and if 1 is at (0,0), and 6 is at (0,1), then to the right of 6 is 7 at (1,1), then 8 at (2,1).

Then above, in row 1, if y= -1, and 1 at (0,0), then (0,-1) should be 4, as per list.

Then left of 4 is 3 at (-1,-1), and right of 4 is 10 at (1,-1)? But in the list, after 4 is 3, then 10, so if x increases, it should be 14, then 4, then 3, then 10, so if 4 at (0,-1), 3 at (-1,-1), then 14 at (-2,-1), and 10 at (1,-1).

But is (-1,-1) adjacent to (0,0)? Earlier calculation: |q-0| =1, |r-0|=1, |s-s'| = | -(-1)-(-1) - (0) | = |1+1| =2? s for (0,0) is 0, for (-1,-1) is -(-1)-(-1) =1+1=2, |s1-s2| = |0-2|=2, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, max is 2, distance 2, not adjacent. Problem.

Perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Another common system is to use cube coordinates, but axial is fine if I get the neighbors right.

Perhaps for the grid, the y-coordinate is not the same.

Let's calculate the distance between 1 and its neighbors.

From the spiral, 1 is at center, neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7 or something, but from the grid, 2 is adjacent, 5 is adjacent (since in same "row" and next cell), 6 is below, and 7 and 8 are not adjacent to 1, as per earlier.

Let's list the cells adjacent to 1.

From the grid layout, cell at (0,0): 1.

Cell at (1,0): 2 (right).

Cell at (-1,0): 5 (left, since in row 2, left of 1 is 5).

Cell at (0,1): ? If below, in row 3, below 1 is 6, so (0,1):6.

Cell at (0,-1):4 (above).

Now, the other two neighbors: in hex grid, also (1,-1) and (-1,1), or (-1,-1) and (1,1), etc.

From earlier, ( -1,1) should be below-left, which is 16 in the list, but 16 is not adjacent if distance is 2.

Perhaps ( -1,1) is not a cell, or not in the grid yet, but it is listed as 16.

But 16 is larger, so probably not adjacent to 1.

Perhaps the grid is oriented differently.

Another idea: perhaps the spiral is filled in a different order.

Let's list the numbers in order and see the path.

Start at 1.

Then to 2 (right).

Then, where is 3? In the grid, 3 is in row 1, which is above, at (-1,-1) or something.

After 2, the next number is 3, but in the grid, after 2 is 9? No, the numbers are not in order in the rows.

The spiral continues. After 2, it might go down or up.

From 1 to 2 right, then to 3 down-right or something.

In the grid, below 2 is 8? But 8 is later.

Let's see the sequence. After 1,2, then 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, etc.

From the grid:

- 1 at center.

- 2 at right.

- Then below 2 is 8? But 8 is after 7,6, etc.

Perhaps it turns left.

From 2, it might go down-left to 3.

But in the grid, below-left of 2: if 2 at (1,0), below-left might be (0,1) or (1,1), but (0,1) is below 1, which is 6, (1,1) is 7.

6 is at (0,1), 7 at (1,1).

3 is in row 1, at y= -1.

So perhaps from 2 at (1,0), it goes up to (1,-1) or something.

Let's assume that from 1 at (0,0), to 2 at (1,0).

Then to 3 at (1,-1)? If y increases down, then (1,-1) is above-right.

In row 1, at (1,-1) is 10? But the list has 3 at some position.

In row 1: 14,4,3,10. If 4 at (0,-1), 3 at (-1,-1), 10 at (1,-1), 14 at (-2,-1).

So (1,-1) is 10.

But 3 is at (-1,-1).

So from 2 at (1,0), to 3 at (-1,-1)? That's a jump.

Perhaps the next number is 3 at (0,-1), but (0,-1) is 4.

I need to see the order of filling.

Perhaps after 2, it goes to the cell below, which is not filled yet, so it must be 3 at (1,1) or (0,1), but (0,1) is below 1, which might be filled later.

Let's list the numbers in the cells based on the grid and see what is adjacent.

From the given:

At y=0 (row 2): x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

At y=1 (row 3): x= -2:16, x= -1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8  (since 16,6,7,8, so if four cells, x= -2,-1,0,1)

But earlier I thought below 1 should be at (0,1), but here at (0,1) is 7, not 6.

6 is at x= -1,y=1.

So below 1 at (0,0) is not directly below; in hex grid, for flat-top, the cell below might be at (0,1) if no offset, but here at (0,1) is 7, and at (-1,1) is 6.

So perhaps the grid is offset; for even y, x integer, for odd y, x half-integer or something, but here y=0 even, x integer, y=1 odd, but x is still integer: -2,-1,0,1.

Perhaps the "below" is not at same x.

In hex grid, the cell directly below (0,0) is at (0,1) if we use axial coordinates with r increasing down.

But in that case, distance to ( -1,1) is 1, as calculated, so ( -1,1) is a neighbor.

For 1 at (0,0), neighbors are:

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):7? But in the grid, (0,1) is 7

- (-1,1):6

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):4

- (1,-1):10? But (1,-1) is 10 in row 1.

Now, is 6 at (-1,1) adjacent to 1? As calculated earlier, |q| =1, |r| =1, |s| = |0 - (-(-1)-1)| = |0 - (1-1)| = |0-0| =0? s1 = -0-0=0, s2 = -(-1)-1 =1-1=0, |q| =1, |r| =1, |s| =0, max is 1, so yes, distance 1, adjacent.

Similarly for others.

So neighbors of 1 are:

- (1,0):2

- (0,1):7

- (-1,1):6

- (-1,0):5

- (0,-1):4

- (1,-1):10

But in the grid, at (1,-1) is 10, at (0,-1) is 4, etc.

But 3 is at (-1,-1), which is not a neighbor of 1; distance to (-1,-1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|= |0 - (-(-1)-(-1))| = |0 - (1+1)| = |0-2|=2, max=2, distance 2, not adjacent.

And 8 is at (1,1), distance to (0,0): |1|,|1|,|s|= |0 - (-1-1)| = |0 - (-2)|=2, max=2, not adjacent.

So neighbors of 1 are 2,7,6,5,4,10.

But 3 is not a neighbor, 8 is not, etc.

Now, the numbers are 2,4,5,6,7,10. But 3 is missing, and 8 is missing, but they should be neighbors if it's a full ring, but in spiral, the first ring has numbers 2 to 7, I think, but here we have 10 which is larger.

Let's see the values: 2,4,5,6,7,10. 3 is not there, 8 is not there, 9 is at (2,0), which is not adjacent.

So for 1, neighbors are 2,4,5,6,7,10, but 3 and 8 are not neighbors, which is odd because 3 should be close.

Perhaps the spiral is filled differently.

Let's list the order of filling.

Start at 1.

Then move right to 2.

Then, probably move down-right to 3, but in the grid, at (1,1) is 8, which is later.

From 2 at (1,0), the next cell might be below, at (1,1), but in the grid (1,1) is 8, but 3 should be earlier.

Perhaps it moves left-down to (0,1), but (0,1) is 7.

Or to (0,-1), but (0,-1) is 4.

Let's look at the sequence. After 1,2, then 3 is next. Where is 3? In the grid, 3 is in row 1, at (-1,-1), with 14,4,3,10, so at x= -1,y= -1.

From 2 at (1,0) to 3 at (-1,-1)? That's not adjacent; distance |1-(-1)|=2, |0-(-1)|=1, |s1-s2| = | -1-0 - (-(-1)-(-1)) | s1 for (1,0) = -1-0= -1, s2 for (-1,-1) = -(-1)-(-1) =1+1=2, |s1-s2| = |-1-2|=3, |dq|=2, |dr|=1, max=3, distance 3, not adjacent.

So that can't be.

Perhaps the grid is not with y increasing down; perhaps y increases up.

In the grid, row 1 is above row 2, so if y increases up, then row 1 is y=1, row 2 y=0, row 3 y= -1 or something.

Let's try that.

Set row 2 as y=0: cells x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Row 1 as y=1: 14,4,3,10  so x= -2:14, x= -1:4? But earlier we had 4 at (0,-1), but now at y=1.

Assume x from left to right.

So at y=1: x= -2:14, x= -1:4, x=0:3, x=1:10? But then (0,1):3, ( -1,1):4, etc.

Then row 3 y= -1: 16,6,7,8 so x= -2:16, x= -1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8

Now, 1 at (0,0)

Neighbors:

- (1,0):2

- (0,-1):7? Since y= -1, (0,-1):7

- (-1,-1):6

- (-1,0):5

- (0,1):3

- (1,1):10

So neighbors are 2,7,6,5,3,10.

Numbers 2,3,5,6,7,10. Again, 4 is at (-1,1), which is not adjacent; distance to (0,0): | -1-0| =1, |1-0|=1, |s| = |0 - (-(-1)-1)| = |0 - (1-1)| = |0-0| =0, max=1, distance 1, so it should be adjacent, but in this list, at (-1,1) is 4, and it is adjacent, but in the neighbors above, I have (0,1):3, (1,1):10, but not (-1,1).

I missed it. The six neighbors are:

- (1,0):2

- (1,-1): ? (1,-1) is at y= -1, x=1, which is 8 in row 3

- (0,-1):7

- (-1,0):5

- (-1,1):4

- (0,1):3

And (1,1):10, but (1,1) is not a neighbor; distance |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1, |s| = | -1-1 - 0| = | -2| =2, max=2, distance 2.

Similarly, (-1,-1):6, distance | -1-0|=1, | -1-0|=1, |s| = |0 - (-(-1)-(-1))| = |0 - (1+1)| = |0-2|=2, max=2, not adjacent.

So neighbors are: (1,0):2, (0,-1):7, (-1,0):5, (-1,1):4, (0,1):3, and the sixth is (1,-1):8? But (1,-1) is 8, and distance to (0,0): |1-0|=1, | -1-0|=1, |s| = | -1-(-1) - 0| s1 for (0,0) =0, s2 for (1,-1) = -1-(-1) = -1+1=0, |s|=0, |dq|=1, |dr|=1, max=1, distance 1, yes adjacent.

So neighbors of 1 are:

- (1,0):2

- (1,-1):8

- (0,-1):7

- (-1,0):5

- (-1,1):4

- (0,1):3

And in the grid, at those positions: (1,0):2, (1,-1):8 (since y= -1, x=1 in row 3), (0,-1):7 (y= -1, x=0), (-1,0):5 (y=0, x= -1), (-1,1):4 (y=1, x= -1), (0,1):3 (y=1, x=0)

Perfect! And the numbers are 2,3,4,5,7,8. 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not a neighbor, as distance 2.

And 10 at (1,1), not neighbor.

So for 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8.

The sequence makes sense: 1, then neighbors filled in order, but not sequentially; in the spiral, it might be filled in a path.

But anyway, now we have the coordinate system.

So axial coordinates (q,r), with s = -q-r implicit.

y is r, x is q, in my notation, I used x for q, y for r.

So position (q,r).

1 at (0,0)

Neighbors: (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1) as above.

In the filling order, after 1, it went to (1,0):2, then to (1,-1):3? But in the grid, (1,-1) is 8, not 3.

In the grid, at (1,-1) is 8, at (0,1) is 3, etc.

From the values, at (0,1):3, at (-1,1):4, at (-1,0):5, at (0,-1):7, at (1,-1):8, at (1,0):2.

So the numbers are: (0,0):1, then neighbors: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8? But 6 is missing, and 7 is at (0,-1), but 6 should be before 7.

Perhaps the order is different.

After 1 at (0,0), it moves to (1,0):2.

Then from there, it might move to (1,-1): but in the grid (1,-1) is 8, which is later.

Perhaps it moves to (0,1):3.

Let's see the sequence of numbers.

The spiral probably goes: start at 1.

Then move in some direction, say east, to 2.

Then turn 60 degrees, say southeast, to 3.

Then continue.

From 2 at (1,0), if it moves to (1,1), but (1,1) is not a neighbor; neighbors of 2 are (2,0), (2,-1), (1,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)? (1,1) is not adjacent to (1,0); distance |0|,|1|,|s|= | -1-1 - (-1-0)| = | -2 - (-1)| = | -1| =1, max=1, yes adjacent.

(q1,r1)=(1,0), (q2,r2)=(1,1), |dq|=0, |dr|=1, s1= -1-0= -1, s2= -1-1= -2, |s1-s2|=1, max(0,1,1)=1, distance 1, yes.

So neighbors of (1,0) are: (2,0), (2,-1), (1,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1).

In the grid, (0,0) is 1, (2,0) is 9, (1,-1) is 8, (0,1) is 3, (1,1) is not filled yet? In row 1, we have up to x=1:10, but at (1,1) should be y=1,x=1, which is 10 in our earlier assignment.

At (1,1):10.

But for the path from 2, it might go to (1,1) or to (2,0) or to (1,-1).

If it goes to (1,1):10, but 10 is large, while 3 is at (0,1), which is also a neighbor.

(0,1) is neighbor of both 1 and 2.

So probably after 2, it goes to (0,1):3.

Then from 3 at (0,1), neighbors include (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1), (-1,2), (0,0), (-1,0)? (0,0) is 1, ( -1,1) is 4, etc.

Likely it goes to (-1,1):4.

Then from 4 at (-1,1), to (-1,0):5.

Then from 5 at (-1,0), to (0,-1) or ( -1,-1) or ( -2,0), etc.

In the grid, at (0,-1):7, at (-1,-1):6, at (-2,0):15.

After 5, it might go to (-1,-1):6.

Then from 6 at (-1,-1), to (0,-1):7.

Then from 7 at (0,-1), to (1,-1):8.

Then from 8 at (1,-1), to (2,-1) or (2,0) or (1,0), but (1,0) is 2, already filled, so to (2,0):9.

Then to (2,1) or (3,0), etc.

In the grid, at (2,0):9, at (2,1):? not filled yet, at (3,0):? not in grid.

After 9, it might go to (2,1): but in row 1, at x=2,y=1? But row 1 has only up to x=1:10, and 14 at x=-2, so probably (2,1) is not filled; instead, it might go to (3,0) or back to other side.

From 8 at (1,-1), to (2,0):9, then to (2,1)? But (2,1) is not in the given rows; the given rows show after that probably (3,0) or something.

The snippet shows ...14,4,3,10... so 10 is at (1,1) as we have, which is filled after some.

After 9 at (2,0), it might go to (2,1): but if it's not filled, but in the path, after 8,9, then next is 10, which is at (1,1).

From 9 at (2,0), neighbors include (3,0), (3,-1), (2,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).

(1,0) is 2, filled; (2,-1) might be next or (1,1).

(1,1) is adjacent, and not filled, so probably to (1,1):10.

Then from 10 at (1,1), to (1,2) or (0,2) or (2,1), etc.

Then to 11,12, etc.

But in the snippet, after 10 is ..., and then row ends, but we have 14 at (-2,1), which is filled later.

The spiral continues outward.

But now we have the coordinate system and the filling order roughly.

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to find the position of 2026 in this spiral, then find its six neighbors, then sum their values.

Since it's a spiral on hex grid, there might be a formula for the position given the number.

The spiral starts at 1, and each "ring" has more cells.

Let me find how many cells are in each layer.

The center cell is layer 0: 1 cell.

Layer 1: the first ring around it. In hex grid, each ring k has 6k cells for k>=1.

For example, layer 1: 6 cells: numbers 2 through 7? But in our case, for 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8? 6 is missing? No, in our assignment, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, so numbers 2 to 8 except 6? But 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not adjacent.

Earlier we have neighbors: 2,3,4,5,7,8. So 6 is not a neighbor? But 6 is at (-1,-1), distance from (0,0) is 2, as calculated, so it's in the next ring.

But numbers: 2,3,4,5,7,8. So missing 6? But 6 is filled, at (-1,-1).

In the sequence: after 1 (layer 0), then layer 1 should have cells at distance 1.

Distance 1 from center: all cells with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=1.

Since s=-q-r, max(|q|,|r|,|-q-r|)=1.

For example, (1,0): |q|=1,|r|=0,|s|=1

(0,1): |q|=0,|r|=1,|s|=1

(-1,1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=0? s=-(-1)-1=1-1=0, so max(1,1,0)=1

Similarly, (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1) all have max 1.

(1,1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=|-1-1|=2, max=2>1

(-1,-1): max(|-1|,|-1|,|2|)=2

So the six neighbors are exactly those six positions: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1)

And in our case, filled with 2,3,4,5,7,8? But that's six cells, numbers should be consecutive, but 2 to 7, but here we have 2,3,4,5,7,8, missing 6? No, 6 is at (-1,-1), which is not in this ring.

But in the filling, at (-1,-1) is 6, which is filled after 5 and before 7, so it is part of the first ring? But position is not adjacent.

Contradiction.

In our earlier assignment, at (-1,-1) is 6, and it is at distance 2, not 1.

But in the filling order, after 5 at (-1,0), it goes to (-1,-1):6, then to (0,-1):7, etc.

But (-1,-1) is not adjacent to center, but it is filled early.

Perhaps the "ring" is not by distance, but by the spiral path.

For the spiral, the first "layer" after center is the six cells, but in this case, it includes cells at distance 1, which are six cells, filled with numbers 2 through 7.

But in our grid, we have 2,3,4,5,7,8 at those positions, and 6 at a different position.

Let's list the positions and numbers for the first few.

From filling order:

Start (0,0):1

Then to (1,0):2

Then to (0,1):3  (since from 2, it went to (0,1), which is neighbor)

From 3 at (0,1), to (-1,1):4  (left or down-left)

From 4 at (-1,1), to (-1,0):5  (down)

From 5 at (-1,0), to (-1,-1):6  (down-right? since r increases down, so to ( -1,-1))

From 6 at (-1,-1), to (0,-1):7  (right)

From 7 at (0,-1), to (1,-1):8  (right)

From 8 at (1,-1), to (2,0):9  (up-right? to (2,0), which is neighbor? distance from (1,-1) to (2,0): |dq|=1, |dr|=1, s1= -1-(-1)=0, s2= -2-0= -2, |s1-s2|=2, max(1,1,2)=2, distance 2, not adjacent! Oh no.

Problem. From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent; they are distance 2 apart.

But in the spiral, it should move to an adjacent cell.

Perhaps it moves to (1,0) but that's filled, or to (2,-1), or to (2,-2), etc.

In the grid, after 8 is 9 at (2,0), but how to get there from (1,-1)?

From (1,-1), neighbors are: (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2), (0,-1), (0,0), (1,0)

(0,-1) is 7, filled; (0,0) is 1, filled; (1,0) is 2, filled; so new cells are (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2)

But in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, which is not in this list; (2,0) is not a neighbor of (1,-1).

So mistake in filling order.

Perhaps after 8 at (1,-1), it moves to (2,-1): but in the grid, (2,-1) is not given; in row 3, we have up to x=1:8, so (2,-1) might be later.

Then to (2,0):9.

But (2,-1) to (2,0) is adjacent.

So perhaps the path is: from 8 at (1,-1), to (2,-1): say 9, but in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, not (2,-1).

In row 2, at x=2,y=0 is 9, which is at (2,0).

From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent, but to (2,-1) would be adjacent, but (2,-1) is not in the given rows; probably it is filled later.

Perhaps from 8, it moves to (1,0) but filled, or to (0,0) filled, so only new directions.

Another possibility: after 7 at (0,-1), it might go to (1,-1):8, then to (2,0): but not adjacent, so perhaps it goes to (1,0) but filled, or to (0,-2) or something.

Let's look at the numbers. After 8, next is 9 at (2,0), but how? Perhaps it moves to (2,-1) first, but not given.

Perhaps the turn is different.

Let's list the cells in order of filling.

From the grid and the sequence:

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0)

3 at (0,1)

4 at (-1,1)

5 at (-1,0)

6 at (-1,-1)  // this is distance 2 from center

7 at (0,-1)

8 at (1,-1)

9 at (2,0)  // distance from (1,-1) to (2,0) is 2, not adjacent

10 at (1,1)

11 at (0,2) or something, not given.

But from 8 to 9 is not adjacent, which is impossible for a path that fills adjacent cells.

Unless the spiral jumps, but typically it doesn't.

Perhaps the coordinate system is wrong.

Another idea: perhaps the grid is with pointy-top hexagons, not flat-top.

In pointy-top, the neighbors are different.

For pointy-top, axial coordinates, neighbors might be (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1) same as before? No, the relative positions are the same; the neighbor offsets are the same regardless of orientation; it's just how you assign coordinates.

The adjacency is the same; each cell has six neighbors at ( ±1,0), (0,±1), (±1,∓1) in (q,r).

The issue is the filling order.

From the given grid, after 1,2, then 3 is at (0,1), 4 at (-1,1), 5 at (-1,0), then 6 at (-1,-1), 7 at (0,-1), 8 at (1,-1), then 9 at (2,0), which is not adjacent to 8.

But 9 is at (2,0), and 8 at (1,-1), and (2,0) is not neighbor of (1,-1), but it is neighbor of (1,0) which is 2.

Perhaps after 8, it moves back to (1,0) but filled, or to a new cell.

From (1,-1), it might move to (2,-1), then to (2,0), but (2,-1) is not filled yet, and in the grid, it might be 9, but in our assignment, (2,0) is 9.

Perhaps (2,0) is filled from (2,-1), but not yet.

Let's assume that from 8 at (1,-1), it moves to (2,-1): say 9, but in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, so perhaps (2,-1) is 9, but in row 3, at y= -1, x=2, but the row has only up to x=1:8, so probably not.

In row 2, y=0, x=2:9, so (2,0):9.

So perhaps the path from 8 to 9 is not direct; but in a continuous path, it must be adjacent.

Unless the spiral is not a path that visits each cell once; but it should be.

Perhaps after filling the first ring, it starts the next, but in this case, after 8, it should go to the next cell in the ring.

Let's calculate the distance from center for each cell.

For (0,0): dist 0

(1,0): dist 1

(0,1): dist 1

(-1,1): dist 1

(-1,0): dist 1

(-1,-1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=|2|=2, max=2, dist 2

(0,-1): dist 1

(1,-1): dist 1

(2,0): |q|=2,|r|=0,|s|=2, max=2, dist 2

(1,1): |q|=1,|r|=1,|s|=2, max=2, dist 2

So cells at dist 1: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1) — six cells.

But in our filling, we have 2,3,4,5,7,8 at these, and 6 at (-1,-1), dist 2, and 9 at (2,0), dist 2, 10 at (1,1), dist 2.

So the dist 1 cells are filled with 2,3,4,5,7,8 — but 6 is missing, and 6 is at dist 2.

The numbers are not consecutive; 6 is filled after 5 and before 7, but at a dist 2 cell.

So the spiral fills cells in order, but not by ring; it fills all cells within a certain distance, but in a path that may go to outer cells early.

In this case, after filling some dist 1 cells, it goes to a dist 2 cell before finishing the dist 1 ring.

Specifically, after 5 at (-1,0) (dist 1), it goes to (-1,-1) (dist 2) for 6, then back to (0,-1) (dist 1) for 7, then to (1,-1) (dist 1) for 8, then to (2,0) (dist 2) for 9, then to (1,1) (dist 2) for 10, etc.

So the path is not staying on the ring; it ventures out.

To find the position of a given number, I need to model the spiral path.

The spiral on hex grid might have a standard form.

I recall that for a hexagonal spiral, the number of cells in each "layer" or "ring" can be calculated.

Let k be the ring number, starting from 0.

Ring k has cells at distance k from center.

Number of cells in ring k: for k=0, 1 cell.

For k>=1, 6k cells.

For example, k=1: 6*1=6 cells.

In our case, dist 1 cells are 6 cells, should be numbers 2 to 7.

But in our filling, dist 1 cells have numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 6 is at dist 2, number 6, which is before 7.

So the filling order is not by ring; it fills cells in a path that may be in different rings.

Perhaps the rings are filled in order, but within a ring, the filling order is specific.

For ring k, it has 6k cells, filled in order.

But for k=1, 6 cells: should be numbers 2 to 7.

But in our case, cell at (-1,-1) is filled with 6, but it is dist 2, not dist 1.

So not.

Perhaps the "arm" or something.

Another way: perhaps the spiral is filled by moving in six directions in sequence.

Start at 0,0.

Move right: to (1,0):2

Then move down-right: to (1,-1): but in our case it went to (0,1):3, which is up-left or something.

Perhaps it's a different direction.

Let's define the move directions.

Suppose the six directions are: right, down-right, down-left, left, up-left, up-right.

In axial coords:

- right: dq=1, dr=0

- down-right: dq=1, dr=-1? if r increases down.

If r increases down, then down-right might be dq=1, dr=1? let's see.

From (0,0), down-right should be to (1,1) or (1,-1)? earlier we have cells.

From (0,0), down-right to (1,-1) if r increases down, since r decreases in up direction.

Assume r increases as we go down.

So from (0,0), down-right: to (1,-1)? but (1,-1) is below and right.

In our path, from (0,0) to (1,0): right.

Then from (1,0) to (0,1): which is up-left, since q decreases, r increases (down).

So not a consistent direction.

Perhaps the turn is 60 degrees left or right.

From 1 to 2: east.

Then from 2, turn 60 degrees left (counter-clockwise), so to northeast, but in hex, northeast might be to (1,1) or (0,1).

In our case, it went to (0,1), which is northwest if we consider q east, r north, but we have r increasing down, so it's messy.

Perhaps for the purpose of finding neighbors, I can find the ring of 2026 and its position in the ring.

First, find which ring 2026 is in.

Let n be the number.

Ring k has cells from sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 6i +1 to sum_{i=0}^{k} 6i.

The first cell of ring k is at distance k.

Number of cells up to ring k-1 is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 6i = 1 + 6* \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1)

For k>=1.

For example, up to ring 0: 1 cell.

Up to ring 1: 1 + 6*1 = 7 cells? But ring 1 has 6 cells, so up to ring 1 is 1+6=7 cells, numbers 1 to 7.

But in our case, at dist 1, we have cells with numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 6 is at dist 2, so not.

Up to ring k-1: S(k-1) = 1 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1, but for k=1, S(0) =1 (up to ring 0).

S(m) = number of cells within distance m = 1 + 6* \frac{m(m+1)}{2} / something? Standard for hex grid, number of cells within distance m is 1 + 3m(m+1) for m>=0? Let's calculate.

For m=0: 1 cell.

 m=1: cells with dist <=1: dist 0 and dist 1: 1 + 6 =7 cells.

 m=2: dist 0,1,2: dist 2 has how many cells? At distance 2, max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2, so cells with |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |s|<=2, but with max 2.

Number is 3*2*2 = 12? General formula for number at distance k is 6k for k>=1.

So within distance m: sum_{k=0}^m c_k, with c_0=1, c_k=6k for k>=1.

So S(m) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^m 6k = 1 + 6* \frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 1 + 3m(m+1)

For m=0: 1

 m=1: 1+3*1*2=7

 m=2: 1+3*2*3=1+18=19

 m=3: 1+3*3*4=1+36=37

 etc.

The largest number in ring m is S(m) = 1 + 3m(m+1)

The smallest number in ring m is S(m-1) +1 = [1 + 3(m-1)m] +1 = 2 + 3m(m-1)

For m>=1.

For example, ring m=1: smallest number 2 + 3*1*0 =2, largest 7, cells 2 to 7.

But in our filling, cell at (-1,-1) dist 2 has number 6, which should be in ring 1, but it's dist 2, so for m=2, smallest number 2 + 3*2*1 =2+6=8, largest 19.

But 6 is less than 8, so it should be in ring 1, but it's at dist 2 >1, contradiction.

So the filling order is not by ring; the cells are not filled in order of increasing distance.

In this spiral, cells are filled in a path that may have cells of different distances early on.

To handle this, I need to simulate the spiral or find a formula for the position.

Perhaps for this particular spiral, the path is known.

From the filling order we have:

1: (0,0)

2: (1,0)

3: (0,1)

4: (-1,1)

5: (-1,0)

6: (-1,-1)  // dist 2

7: (0,-1)  // dist 1

8: (1,-1)  // dist 1

9: (2,0)  // dist 2

10: (1,1)  // dist 2

11: (0,2) or (2,1) etc.

From 8 at (1,-1), to 9 at (2,0), but not adjacent, so perhaps it moves to (2,-1) first, but not in grid, or from 8 to 9 is not direct; but in the sequence, after 8 is 9, so it must be adjacent.

Unless the grid has more cells.

In row 3, we have 16,6,7,8, so at y= -1, x= -2:16, x= -1:6, x=0:7, x=1:8, so no cell at (2,-1) in this row.

In row 2, y=0, x=2:9, so (2,0):9.

From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent, but to (2,-1) would be adjacent, but (2,-1) is not present; probably it is filled later.

Perhaps after 8, it moves to (1,0) but filled, or to (0,0) filled, so only new cell is (2,-1), but not listed, so perhaps it is 9 at (2,-1), but in the grid it's at (2,0).

Perhaps the coordinate for y is different.

Another idea: perhaps the r coordinate is not the row; perhaps each "row" in the grid is not a constant r.

In hex grid, in axial coords, each cell has a unique (q,r), and the grid is usually drawn with rows at constant r or constant s.

In our case, in the given grid, for the cells given, let's list their (q,r) based on our initial assignment.

For row 1 ( top row): cells at y=1: (q,r) = (-2,1):14, (-1,1):4, (0,1):3, (1,1):10

But r=1 for all, so this row has constant r=1.

Row 2 (middle): y=0: (-2,0):15, (-1,0):5, (0,0):1, (1,0):2, (2,0):9

Constant r=0? But r=0, while row 1 r=1, but if r increases down, then row 1 should be above row 2, so r=1 above r=0, but then below should be r= -1 or something.

Row 3: y= -1: (-2,-1):16, (-1,-1):6, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8

So r= -1 for this row.

So rows are at constant r: r=1, r=0, r= -1 for the three rows.

And within each row, q varies.

Now, for a cell at (q,r), the neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)

Note that (q,r+1) and (q-1,r+1) are in the row below if r increases down, but in this case, for a cell at r, the row below is r-1 (since r increases down, so lower row has lower r? No.

If r increases as we go down, then a lower row has higher r.

In our case, row 1 is top, r=1, row 2 is middle, r=0, row 3 is bottom, r= -1. So as we go down, r decreases from 1 to 0 to -1.

So r decreases as we go down.

So for a cell at (q,r), the row below is r-1 (since r decreases, so r-1 is lower).

For example, cell at (0,0) in row 2, below it should be at r= -1, which is row 3, at (0,-1):7, as we have.

Neighbors: (q+1,r) = (1,0):2

 (q,r+1) = (0,1):3  (above, since r+1=1>0)

 (q-1,r+1) = (-1,1):4

 (q-1,r) = (-1,0):5

 (q,r-1) = (0,-1):7

 (q+1,r-1) = (1,-1):8

All good.

Now for the path:

From 1 at (0,0)

To 2 at (1,0) : move +dq

From 2 at (1,0) to 3 at (0,1) : move dq= -1, dr=1, so northwest or something.

From 3 at (0,1) to 4 at (-1,1) : move dq= -1, dr=0, so west.

From 4 at (-1,1) to 5 at (-1,0) : move dq=0, dr= -1, so south (since r decreases down).

From 5 at (-1,0) to 6 at (-1,-1) : move dq=0, dr= -1, so south again.

From 6 at (-1,-1) to 7 at (0,-1) : move dq=1, dr=0, so east.

From 7 at (0,-1) to 8 at (1,-1) : move dq=1, dr=0, so east again.

From 8 at (1,-1) to 9 at (2,0) : not adjacent; should be to (2,-1) or (1,0) or (0,-1) or (2,-2) or (1,-2) or (0,0), but all filled or not.

Possible moves: (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2), (0,-1) filled, (0,0) filled, (1,0) filled.

So likely to (2,-1):9, but in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, not (2,-1).

Perhaps to (2,0) is not, but in the grid it is at (2,0).

Perhaps from 8, it moves to (1,0) but filled, or to a new cell.

After 8, the next number is 9 at (2,0), which is adjacent to 2 at (1,0), so perhaps from 8 it jumps, but that can't be.

Unless the path is not continuous; but for a spiral, it should be.

Perhaps after 8, it turns and goes to (2,0), but (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0) and to (2,1), etc.

From (1,-1) to (2,0) is not adjacent, but to (2,-1) is adjacent, and (2,-1) might be 9, but in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, so perhaps (2,-1) is a different number.

In the given, no cell at (2,-1); in row 3, r= -1, cells only up to q=1, so no q=2.

In row 2, r=0, q=2:9, so (2,0):9.

So perhaps the cell at (2,-1) is filled later.

Let's assume that from 8 at (1,-1), it moves to (2,-1): say 9, but then in the grid it should be there, but it's not given, so probably not.

Perhaps the spiral at this point moves to (1,0) but filled, so it must go to a new cell, and (2,0) is not adjacent, so it must be (2,-1) or (0,-2) etc.

Perhaps it goes to (0,2) or something.

Let's look at the number 9; in the grid, it is at (2,0), and it is adjacent to 2 at (1,0), and to 10 at (1,1), etc.

From the sequence, after 8, it is 9, so the cell filled after (1,-1) is (2,0), so they must be adjacent, but they are not.

Unless in this grid, the adjacency is different, but in hex grid, it should be as above.

Perhaps for this spiral, the grid is not perfectly hexagonal in the usual way, but from the given, it is.

Another idea: perhaps " below" is not r-1; perhaps r increases up.

Let's try setting r increasing up.

So row 1 (top): r=0 or r=1?

Set row 1 as r=0: cells (-2,0):14, (-1,0):4, (0,0):3, (1,0):10

Row 2 (middle): r=1: (-2,1):15, (-1,1):5, (0,1):1, (1,1):2, (2,1):9

But 1 is at (0,1), not center.

Then row 3 (bottom): r=2: (-2,2):16, (-1,2):6, (0,2):7, (1,2):8

Then for 1 at (0,1), neighbors: (1,1):2, (0,2):7, (-1,2):6, (-1,1):5, (0,0):3, (1,0):10

Same as before: 2,3,5,6,7,10.

Same issue.

So back to square one.

Perhaps the number 6 is not at (-1,-1); in the grid, for row 3: 16,6,7,8, and if this is r= -1, and 1 at (0,0), then below 1 is (0,-1):7, so 6 is at (-1,-1), as before.

But then from 5 at (-1,0) to 6 at (-1,-1): move dr= -1 (down), which is adjacent.

From 6 to 7 at (0,-1): move dq=1, dr=0, east, adjacent.

From 7 to 8 at (1,-1): move dq=1, dr=0, east, adjacent.

From 8 at (1,-1) to next. Possible new cells: (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,-2), (0,-2), etc., or (2,0), but (2,0) is not adjacent.

 (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0):2, which is filled, and to (2,1), etc.

So likely it moves to (2,-1):9.

But in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, not (2,-1).

Unless in row 3, there is a cell at (2,-1), but the list has only four cells: 16,6,7,8, which are at q= -2,-1,0,1, so no q=2.

So perhaps after 8, it moves to (2,0): but not adjacent, so impossible.

Perhaps it moves to (1,0) but filled, or to (0,-1) filled, so it must go to (2,-1), but that cell is not in the grid yet, so it must be added, but in the given snippet, it's not there, so probably it is filled later, and 9 is at (2,0).

Perhaps the spiral at this point has filled all cells with r >= -1, but not, since r= -2 etc.

Perhaps for the cell at (1,-1), after filling, the next cell is (2,0), but since it's not adjacent, perhaps in this spiral, it allows moving to cells that are not adjacent, but that would be strange.

Perhaps I have the wrong number for 9.

In the grid, in row 2: .. 15 5 1 2 9 .. so at q=2,r=0:9.

And 8 is at q=1,r= -1:8.

Distance between (2,0) and (1,-1): |2-1|=1, |0-(-1)|=1, s1= -2-0= -2, s2= -1-(-1)=0, |s1-s2|=2, max(1,1,2)=2, distance 2, not adjacent.

But in the path, 8 is followed by 9, so they must be adjacent if the path is continuous.

Unless the path is not continuous; but for a spiral filling, it should be a path that visits each cell once, so adjacent cells are consecutive in the path.

Perhaps the number 9 is not immediately after 8; let's see the sequence.

From the grid, the numbers are not in order; for example, in row 1: 14,4,3,10 — so 3,4,10,14

Row 2: 15,5,1,2,9 — 1,2,5,9,15

Row 3: 16,6,7,8 — 6,7,8,16

So the sequence is not sorted, but the spiral order is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,...

From the positions, 1, then 2, then 3 at (0,1), then 4 at (-1,1), then 5 at (-1,0), then 6 at (-1,-1), then 7 at (0,-1), then 8 at (1,-1), then next should be 9, which is at (2,0), but not adjacent to 8.

Perhaps it is at (1,1) or (2,-1).

In the grid, at (1,1) is 10, at (2,0) is 9.

So 9 is at (2,0), 10 at (1,1).

So after 8, it is 9 at (2,0).

To resolve this, perhaps from 8 at (1,-1), it moves to (1,0) but filled, so it must turn and go to (2,0), but since not adjacent, perhaps in this grid, the move is allowed, but that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the cell at (2,0) is adjacent if we consider the grid topology, but in hex grid, it's not.

Unless the grid is not hexagonal; but the problem says "hexagonal grid", and each cell has 6 neighbors, so it must be.

Perhaps "6 neighbors" means something else, but for 1, we have six neighbors as per grid.

Another idea: perhaps for the cell 2026, its neighbors are the cells adjacent to it in the grid, not in the spiral path, so I just need to find its position, then the six adjacent cells, then their numbers, sum them.

So I need a way to find the (q,r) coordinates for a given n, then find its neighbors, then find their n's, sum.

So the challenge is to find the position as a function of n.

From the filling order, it seems that the spiral goes in layers, but with a different path.

Perhaps it is a standard hexagonal spiral with a specific starting direction.

After some search in my memory, I recall that in some hexagonal spirals, the path is: from center, move right, then at each corner, turn 60 degrees left.

But in this case, from 1 to 2: right.

Then from 2, turn left 60 degrees, so from east, turn left to northeast, which would be to (1,1) or (0,1).

In our case, it went to (0,1):3, which is northwest if east is +q, north is +r, but we have r increasing down, so it's south-west or something.

Perhaps turn right 60 degrees.

From 2 at (1,0), facing east, turn right 60 degrees, so to southeast, which might be to (1,-1).

Then to 3 at (1,-1): but in our grid, (1,-1) is 8, not 3.

3 is at (0,1).

So not.

Perhaps the initial move is different.

Let's list the moves from the path we have:

- From 1 (0,0) to 2 (1,0): move +dq

- From 2 (1,0) to 3 (0,1): move dq= -1, dr= +1 (since r increases down, dr=+1 is down, but dq= -1 is left, so down-left or southwest.

- From 3 (0,1) to 4 (-1,1): move dq= -1, dr=0, so west.

- From 4 (-1,1) to 5 (-1,0): move dq=0, dr= -1, so north (since r decreases).

- From 5 (-1,0) to 6 (-1,-1): move dq=0, dr= -1, so north again.

- From 6 (-1,-1) to 7 (0,-1): move dq= +1, dr=0, so east.

- From 7 (0,-1) to 8 (1,-1): move dq= +1, dr=0, so east again.

- From 8 (1,-1) to 9 (2,0): not adjacent, so perhaps it moves to (2,-1) or (1,0), but filled.

After two east moves, it might turn north or south.

From 8 at (1,-1), if it moves dr= -1, to (1,-2): say 9, but not in grid.

Or dq=1, dr=0 to (2,-1):9.

But in grid, 9 is at (2,0), so perhaps (2,0) is 9, and it is reached from (2,-1) or from (1,0).

Perhaps the cell at (2,-1) is filled as 9, but in the given, it's not there, so for the sake of the problem, we can assume the path, and for 2026, it's far out, so the local behavior might be consistent.

Perhaps for larger n, the ring is filled completely before moving out, but for small n, it's not.

Let's calculate the number for some cells.

For example, at (0,0):1

(1,0):2

(0,1):3

(-1,1):4

(-1,0):5

(-1,-1):6

(0,-1):7

(1,-1):8

(2,0):9

(1,1):10

(0,2):? not given, but probably 11 or later.

(-2,1):14 in grid, but 14 is larger, so probably filled later.

After 10 at (1,1), next might be (0,2) or (2,1) or (-1,2), etc.

In the grid, at (0,2) not given, at (2,1) not, at (-1,2) not.

From 10 at (1,1), it might go to (1,2) or (0,1) filled, etc.

Perhaps to (0,2):11

Then to (-1,2):12

Then to (-2,2):13 or something.

In the grid, at (-2,1):14, which is given, so probably filled later.

Let's assume the path continues.

From 9 at (2,0), to 10 at (1,1): move dq= -1, dr= +1, so down-left.

Then from 10 at (1,1) to next. Possible (1,2), (0,2), (0,1) filled, (2,1), (2,0) filled, (1,0) filled.

So likely to (0,2):11

Then to (-1,2):12

Then to (-2,2):13

Then to (-2,1):14 (since down or left)

In grid, (-2,1):14, so yes.

Then from 14 at (-2,1) to (-2,0):15 (down, dr= -1)

In grid, (-2,0):15

Then to (-2,-1):16 (down, dr= -1)

In grid, (-2,-1):16

Then to (-1,-1):6 filled, so to (0,-1):7 filled, so to (0,-2) or (-1,-2) or ( -3,0) etc.

Likely to (-1,-2):17 or something.

Then to (0,-2):18, etc.

So the path is continuous, and for from 8 to 9, it jumped to (2,0), but in the sequence, 8 is at (1,-1), 9 at (2,0), not adjacent, but in the path, after 8 is 9, so in the cell order, cell 8 is followed by cell 9, but they are not adjacent, which is impossible for a path that visits each cell once with moves to adjacent cells.

Unless the spiral is not a path, but it is described as a spiral, so it should be a space-filling curve or something, but typically for such problems, it is a path visiting each cell once, moving to adjacent cell.

So for cell 8 and cell 9 to be consecutive in the filling order, they must be adjacent.

But in this case, (1,-1) and (2,0) are not adjacent.

Unless in this grid, they are adjacent, but in hex grid, they are not; there is no edge between them.

Perhaps the grid is with a different topology, but the problem says "hexagonal grid", so it should be hexagonal tiling, where each cell has six neighbors, and (1,-1) and (2,0) are not neighbors; the common neighbors are (1,0) and (2,-1), etc.

So to be adjacent, they must share a side, which they don't.

So the only explanation is that after 8 at (1,-1), the next cell is not 9 at (2,0), but another cell.

Perhaps 9 is at a different position.

In the grid, in row 2, after 2 is 9, but between 1 and 2 is 5 and 15, but the cells are listed in the row, not in order.

The number 9 is at (2,0), and 8 at (1,-1), and 8 is cell number 8, 9 is cell number 9, so in filling order, 8 then 9.

But perhaps in the spiral, after filling (1,-1), it fills (2,-1), but that cell is not in the given grid, so for the sake of the problem, we can assume it is filled later, and 9 is at (2,0), but then they are not consecutive.

Perhaps the number 9 is at (2,-1), but in the grid it's written at (2,0), which is not.

I think there might be a mistake in the grid interpretation.

Let's look back at the grid:

" ... 14 4 3 10 ... " row 1

".. 15 5 1 2 9 ... " row 2

"... 16 6 7 8 ... " row 3

So visually, it's:

Row 1: 14, 4, 3, 10

Row 2: 15, 5, 1, 2, 9

Row 3: 16, 6, 7, 8

With 1 at the center.

Now, typically in hexagonal grid, the rows are offset, so that the cell below 1 is between 1 and 2 or something.

In many representations, for flat-top hexagons, the row below is shifted by half a cell.

For example, in row 2, cells at x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Then in row 3 below, cells might be at x=0.5:6, x=1.5:7, etc., but in the list, it's 16,6,7,8, so probably not.

Perhaps for row 3, it is aligned with the left of row 2.

So below 15 is 16, below 5 is 6, below 1 is 7, below 2 is 8, below 9 is nothing or later.

So cell below 1 is 7, below 2 is 8.

Then above 1 is 4? In row 1, above 1 is 4, above 2 is 3 or 10? The list has 4,3,10, so if above 1 is 4, then to the left of 4 is 3, to the right 10, but then above 2 should be 10 or 3, but 2 is at right, so perhaps above 2 is 10.

So positions:

- Above 1: 4

- Left of 4: 3

- Right of 4: 10

- Above 2: 10? But 10 is also above and right, or something.

Assume that row 1 is above row 2, and shifted such that cell at (i,j) in row j.

Set for row 0: y=0: cells at x= -2:15, x= -1:5, x=0:1, x=1:2, x=2:9

Then row above, row 1: y=1: cells at x= -2:14, x= -1:4, x=0:3, x=1:10? But then above 1 at (0,0) should be at (0,1):3, but in the list, 3 is at x=0, but we have 4 at x= -1, so not directly above.

In hex grid with flat-top, the cell above is at (q,r+1) for the same q, but in offset coordinates, it might be different.

Use offset coordinates.

Assume that for even row, cells at integer x, for odd row, at half-integer, but here all x seem integer.

Perhaps the grid is not offset; in some representations, it's axial, and the rows are at constant r or constant s.

In our earlier axial coords, with r constant in rows, and we have the positions, and the adjacency is correct for the cells, but the path has a gap.

Perhaps for the cell 8 and 9, they are adjacent if we consider that (1,-1) and (2,0) are neighbors, but in axial distance, they are not.

Unless the distance formula is different, but in standard, it is as above.

Perhaps for this grid, the cell at (1,-1) and (2,0) share a corner, but in hex grid, cells share sides, not corners, so not adjacent.

I think the only way is to assume that after 8 at (1,-1), the next cell is (2,-1):9, and in the grid, it is not shown, but for the spiral, it is there, and later cells are filled.

In the given snippet, only part of the grid is shown, so cell at (2,-1) is not shown, but exists, and is 9 or later.

But in the grid, at (2,0) is 9, so it can't be.

Perhaps 9 is at (2,-1), and (2,0) is a different number, but in the list, at (2,0) is 9.

Unless the "9" in row 2 is not at (2,0), but the row has 15,5,1,2,9, so likely x= -2,-1,0,1,2 for 15,5,1,2,9, so (2,0):9.

So to resolve, perhaps in the filling order, after 8, it is not 9, but another cell.

Let's list the filling order from the grid and the path.

From the values, the smallest numbers are at the center, so we can see the order.

1 at center.

2 to its right.

3 above-left, in row 1 left of 4.

4 above 1.

5 left of 1.

6 below-left, in row 3 left of 7.

7 below 1.

8 below-right of 1, or below 2.

9 to the right of 2.

10 above-right of 2, or above and right.

14 above-left, etc.

So for 9, it is to the right of 2, so at (2,0).

For 10, in row 1, right of 3, so at (1,1) if 3 at (0,1), 10 at (1,1).

Now, the cell after 8 should be 9, and 8 is at (1,-1), 9 at (2,0).

Perhaps they are considered adjacent in this grid, but geometrically, in a hex grid, the cell at southeast of 1 is (1,-1), and northeast of 2 is (2,0), and they might share a corner, but not a side, so not adjacent.

Perhaps for the purpose of neighbor sum, we can proceed with the coordinate system, and for 2026, find its (q,r), then its six neighbors, then find their numbers, sum.

So I need a way to map n to (q,r).

From the filling order, it seems that the spiral goes in a counter-clockwise manner, filling the rings, but with a specific path for each ring.

For example, for the first ring (dist 1 cells), it filled 2,3,4,5,7,8, but skipped 6, but 6 is not in dist 1.

The dist 1 cells are only those six, filled with 2,3,4,5,7,8, and 6 is at dist 2.

So for ring 1 (dist 1), cells: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8. So all six are filled, with numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8. So number 6 is missing from this ring; it is filled later at dist 2.

The sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,... so 6 is filled after 5 and before 7, but at a dist 2 cell.

So the filling order does not follow the distance; it fills cells at dist 2 before finishing dist 1, but in this case, all dist 1 cells are filled by 8, and 6 is at dist 2 filled as 6, before some dist 1 cells? No, the dist 1 cells are filled with 2,3,4,5,7,8, so cell at (0,-1) is 7, filled after 6, but it is dist 1, while 6 is dist 2.

So the cell at (0,-1) is filled as 7, after 6 at (-1,-1).

But both are filled, and (0,-1) is dist 1, filled later.

To find a formula, I can see that the spiral has arms or something.

Perhaps the spiral is generated by moving in a straight line until it can't, then turn 60 degrees left or right.

In this case, from start, move right: to (1,0):2

Then turn left 60 degrees: from east, turn left to northeast, which is to (0,1):3 ( if we consider the direction).

From (1,0) , facing east, turn left to face north-east, which might be to (1,1) or (0,1).

In our case, it went to (0,1):3, which is north-west if east is +q, but in terms of direction, from (1,0) to (0,1) is vector (-1,1), which is northwest if r increases up, but we have r increases down, so it's southeast or something.

Perhaps define the direction.

From (0,0) to (1,0): direction 0 degrees (east).

Then from (1,0) to (0,1): vector (-1,1), so if r increases down, then this is left and down, so west-south or something, angle arctan(1/-1) = -45 degrees, while previous was 0 degrees, so a turn of -45 degrees, not 60.

Not nice.

Perhaps in terms of hex directions.

Suppose there are 6 directions: 0: +q, 1: +r, 2: -q+r, 3: -q, 4: -r, 5: +q- r or something.

Standard: let's say direction 0: (1,0)  // east
1: (0,1)  // south-east or something, but in axial, (0,1) is not a neighbor in the direction; the neighbors are at the directions.

From a cell, the six neighbors are at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°.

Set for cell at (0,0):
- 0°: (1,0)
- 60°: (1,-1) or (0,1)? Let's define.

If 0° is east: (1,0)
Then 60° might be northeast: (1,1) or southeast: (1,-1).

In our earlier neighbor list, from (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)

So in order, say clockwise: start from (1,0), then (1,-1), then (0,-1), then (-1,0), then (-1,1), then (0,1), back to (1,0).

So the order is (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1)

Angles: if (1,0) is 0°, then (1,-1) is at 300° or -60°, since down-right.

Perhaps for the spiral, it starts at 0°, moves to (1,0):2.

Then turns left 60°, so to 60°, which is (0,1) or (1,1)? In the sequence, it went to (0,1):3, which in the list above, (0,1) is at 240° or something.

From (1,0), the neighbor at 60° from the current direction.

When at a cell, facing a direction, move to the neighbor in that direction, then turn left 60 degrees for the next move.

Start at (0,0), facing 0° (east), move to (1,0):2.

Now at (1,0), facing 0°, then turn left 60°, so now facing 60°.

What is the neighbor at 60° from (1,0).

If at (1,0), neighbors: (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (2,-1)? Same as before.

The neighbor in direction 60°.

If we define that for any cell, direction 0° is +q, 60° is +q- r or something.

Typically, the direction is relative to the cell.

For cell at (q,r), the neighbor in direction d is cell at (q + dx[d], r + dy[d]), with dx, dy constant for each d.

For example, for d=0: (1,0)

d=1: (0,1) or (1,-1), etc.

In our case, from (1,0), after turning to 60°, it moves to the cell in direction 60°.

In the actual path, it moved to (0,1):3, which is vector (-1,1) from (1,0), so dq= -1, dr=1.

So if direction 0° is (1,0), then 60° might be (-1,1) or (0,1), etc.

Perhaps direction 0°: (1,0)
60°: (0,1)
120°: (-1,1)
180°: (-1,0)
240°: (0,-1)
300°: (1,-1)

Yes, that matches the neighbor list.

So directions:
0: (1,0)
1: (0,1)
2: (-1,1)
3: (-1,0)
4: (0,-1)
5: (1,-1)

Now for the spiral: start at (0,0), facing direction 0 (east).

Move in the current direction to the new cell: to (1,0):2.

Now at (1,0), and we turned left 60°, so from current facing 0, turn left to direction 5? Turn left means increase direction by 1 mod 6, or decrease?

Turn left 60° means change to the next direction counter-clockwise.

In the direction list, from 0 to 1 is from east to north-east, which is counter-clockwise.

In our case, from (1,0), after arriving from east, it turned left to face north-east, which is direction 1: (0,1), and moved to (0,1):3.

Yes.

Then at (0,1), arrived from direction? It came from (1,0) by moving in direction 1: (0,1), but from (1,0) to (0,1) is vector (-1,1), which is not direction 1; direction 1 from a cell is (0,1), which for (1,0) would be to (1,1), not (0,1).

Problem.

From (1,0), to move to (0,1), what direction is that? Vector (-1,1), which is not one of the six directions; the directions are only to adjacent cells, and (-1,1) is not a neighbor of (1,0)? Earlier we have that (0,1) is a neighbor of (1,0)? Distance between (1,0) and (0,1): |1-0|=1, |0-1|=1, s1= -1-0= -1, s2= -0-1= -1, |s|=0, max(1,1,0)=1, yes adjacent.

And the vector is (-1,1), which corresponds to direction 2: (-1,1)? In our list, direction 2 is (-1,1), yes.

So from (1,0), to (0,1) is direction 2: (-1,1).

But in the spiral, after arriving at (1,0) from (0,0) by direction 0, it turned left 60°, which should be to direction 1, but it moved in direction 2.

Perhaps it turned left, but the direction is defined differently.

Perhaps after moving, it turns left for the next move, but the turn is based on the arrival direction.

Standard for many spirals is that when you arrive at a cell, if the cell in the left (relative to your arrival direction) is free, turn left, else go straight, etc.

In this case, when arriving at (1,0) from (0,0) by direction 0 (east), so arriving from west, since came from (0,0), which is west of (1,0).

So arriving from direction 3 (west, since (-1,0)).

Then, relative to arrival direction, the "left" cell is the cell at 60° left from the arrival direction.

For arrival from direction d, the left cell is at direction (d+1) mod 6, right cell at (d+5) mod 6.

For arrival from west, d=3, so left cell is direction (3+1) mod 6 =4: (0,-1)

Right cell direction 2: (-1,1)

Then typically, if the left cell is free, turn left, else if straight is free, go straight, else turn right, etc.

In this case, at (1,0), when arrived from direction 3, the cells: left cell dir 4: (0,-1) – is it free? At this point, only 1 and 2 filled, so (0,-1) is free.

So if turn left, move to dir 4: (0,-1)

But in our path, it went to (0,1), which is dir 2: (-1,1), which is the "right" cell.

So not.

Perhaps turn right.

If turn right, move to dir 2: (-1,1) i.e. (0,1), which matches.

So perhaps it turns right 60 degrees at each step.

Let's check.

Start at (0,0), facing east, move to (1,0):2, arrived from direction 3 (west).

Then at (1,0), arrived from dir 3, turn right 60 degrees, so from arrival dir 3, turn right to dir (3+5) mod 6 =8 mod 6=2: (-1,1), so move to (1+(-1),0+1)=(0,1):3.

Yes.

Then at (0,1), arrived from dir? Came from (1,0) by moving in dir 2, so arrived from direction opposite to move direction. When you move in direction d, you arrive from direction (d+3) mod 6.

Since move in d, arrive from -d, which is d+3 mod 6.

So moved in dir 2, so arrive from dir (2+3) mod 6 =5: (1,-1)

So at (0,1), arrived from dir 5 (south-east or (1,-1)).

Then turn right 60 degrees, so from arrival dir 5, turn right to dir (5+5) mod 6=10 mod 6=4: (0,-1)

So move to (0+0,1+(-1))=(0,0), but (0,0) is filled with 1, so cannot.

Problem.

Perhaps if the cell is occupied, it doesn't move there, so it should check if the cell is free.

In this case, (0,0) is occupied, so it should not move there; perhaps then it goes straight or left.

The rule is: after arriving, try to turn right; if the cell in that direction is free, move there; else try straight; else try left; else back, but usually for spiral, it turns left or right consistently.

In this case, at (0,1), arrived from dir 5, turn right to dir 4: (0,-1)

But (0,-1) is free, so it should move to (0,-1):4, but in our path, from (0,1) it went to (-1,1):4, not (0,-1).

So not.

Perhaps turn left.

Start at (0,0), facing east, move to (1,0):2, arrive from dir 3.

Turn left 60 degrees: to dir (3+1) mod 6=4: (0,-1)

Move to (1+0,0+(-1))=(1,-1): say 3, but in our case it went to (0,1).

Not matching.

Perhaps the initial facing is different, or the turn is after moving.

Another common rule is: move in the current facing direction to the new cell; then, if the cell to the left (relative to current facing) is free, turn left, else if straight is free, go straight, else turn right.

Start at (0,0), facing 0 (east).

Move to (1,0):2.

Now at (1,0), facing still 0 (east).

Now, the cell to the left: relative to facing, left is north, which might be dir 1: (0,1)

Is it free? Yes.

So turn left 60° to face dir 1: northeast.

Then move in that direction to (1+0,0+1)=(1,1): say 3, but in our case it went to (0,1).

Not.

If it turns left before moving, but usually after moving.

Perhaps for this spiral, it turns left at each corner, but the "corner" is when it hits the ring or something.

Perhaps for this specific spiral, the path is: from center, move right 1 cell: to (1,0):2

Then move down-left: to (0,1):3

Then move left: to (-1,1):4

Then move down: to (-1,0):5

Then move down-right: to (0,-1):6? But in our case it went to (-1,-1):6

From (-1,0) to (0,-1) is southeast, vector (1,-1), which is dir 5: (1,-1), so to ( -1+1,0+(-1))=(0,-1)

But in our path, it went to (-1,-1):6, which is south, vector (0,-1), dir 4: (0,-1)

So not.

In our path, from (-1,0) to (-1,-1): move dir 4: (0,-1)

Then from (-1,-1) to (0,-1): move dir 0: (1,0)

Then to (1,-1): move dir 0: (1,0) again.

Then from (1,-1) to (2,0): not adjacent.

From (1,-1) , if move dir 0: to (2,-1)

Or dir 1: to (1,0) filled, etc.

So perhaps to (2,-1):9

Then to (2,0):10 or something.

But in grid, 9 is at (2,0), so not.

I think for the sake of time, I should assume the coordinate system as per the grid, and for 2026, it is far out, so the local ring is filled completely, and I can find the ring and position.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors can be found without position, but unlikely.

Another idea: in such spirals, for a number n, its neighbors are n±1, n±k, etc., but from the center, for 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, not consecutive.

For 2, what are its neighbors? In the grid, at (1,0), neighbors: (2,0):9, (1,1):10, (1,-1):8, (0,0):1, (0,1):3, (2,-1)? or (0,-1)

List:

- (q+1,r) = (2,0):9

- (q,r+1) = (1,1):10

- (q-1,r+1) = (0,1):3

- (q-1,r) = (0,0):1

- (q,r-1) = (1,-1):8

- (q+1,r-1) = (2,-1): ? not in grid, but if exists, say later number.

In the given, not specified, but for 2, neighbors are 1,3,8,9,10, and the sixth is (2,-1), say 11 or something.

So numbers 1,3,8,9,10, and one more.

Not nice.

Perhaps for large n, the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and four others.

But to be precise, I need the position.

Perhaps the spiral is such that the number at (q,r) can be found by a formula involving max(|q|,|r|,|s|), and the angle or something.

Let's define the ring k as before, but for each cell in the ring, the number depends on the path.

For a given cell at (q,r), its distance d = max(|q|,|r|,|s|) with s= -q-r.

Then the number of cells within distance d-1 is S(d-1) = 1 + 3d(d-1) for d>=1.

Then the number in the ring at distance d is 6d for d>=1.

Then the cell's number is S(d-1) + offset, where offset depends on the position in the ring.

In this spiral, the offset is determined by the path from the start.

From the filling order, for d=0: (0,0):1

d=1: cells: (1,0):2, (0,1):3, (-1,1):4, (-1,0):5, (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8

So not in order; (0,-1) is 7, while if clockwise, it should be after ( -1,0).

The order is: after center, start at (1,0):2, then to (0,1):3, then to (-1,1):4, then to (-1,0):5, then instead of to (0,-1), it goes to (-1,-1):6 (d=2), then back to (0,-1):7 (d=1), then to (1,-1):8 (d=1), then to (2,0):9 (d=2), then to (1,1):10 (d=2), then to (0,2):11 (d=2), etc.

So for the ring d=1, not all cells are filled before moving to d=2; specifically, the cells (0,-1) and (1,-1) are filled after some d=2 cells.

To model this, perhaps the spiral has a preferred direction.

Perhaps for each "layer", it fills the cells in a specific order, but it's complicated.

Perhaps the number n corresponds to the cell that is the n-th cell in the spiral path, and the path can be generated, and for large n, it's in a large ring, and the neighbors can be found by the relative position.

For example, for a cell in the ring, its neighbors are in the same ring or adjacent rings.

In this case, for 2026, it is in some ring d, and its neighbors are at distance d-1, d, or d+1.

Then the sum can be calculated based on its position in the ring.

But to do that, I need to know d and the arc length or something.

Perhaps there is a formula.

After some thought, I recall that for a hexagonal spiral, the position can be found by finding the ring, then the side, then the index.

In this case, from the filling, for ring d, it starts at (d,0) or something.

For example, for d=1, starts at (1,0):2

For d=2, starts at (-1,-1):6, then (0,-1):7, (1,-1):8, then (2,0):9, (1,1):10, (0,2):11, (-1,2):12, (-2,2):13, (-2,1):14, (-2,0):15, (-2,-1):16, then perhaps (-1,-2):17, etc.

So for ring d=2, it starts at (-1,-1):6, which is not on the axis.

The number of cells up to distance d-1 is S(d-1) = 1 + 3d(d-1) for d>=1.

For d=1, S(0) =1

For d=2, S(1) =1+3*1*2=7

Then ring d=2 has cells from n=8 to n=1+3*2*3=1+18=19, so 8 to 19.

In our filling, starts at 6, which is before 8, so not.

The first cell of ring d is at n = 2 + 3d(d-1) for d>=1, but for d=1, 2+0=2, good; d=2, 2+3*2*1=2+6=8, but in our case first cell at d=2 is 6<8, so not.

Perhaps n = 1 + 3d(d-1) + offset, but for d=1, 1+0=1, but first is 2.

Let's list the number for each cell in order.

Let me try to extend the path.

From 8 at (1,-1)

Then to (2,-1): say 9, but not in grid, so assume it is 9 at (2,-1)

Then to (2,0):10

Then to (1,1):11

But in grid, 9 at (2,0), 10 at (1,1), so not.

Perhaps from 8 to (2,0):9, even though not adjacent, but for the sake of the problem, we can accept that in the spiral, the cells are filled in that order, and for neighbor sum, we use the grid adjacency, not the path adjacency.

So for a cell, its six geographical neighbors on the grid, regardless of the path.

For 2026, find its (q,r), then its six neighbors, then find their numbers, sum.

So I need to find (q,r) for n=2026.

To do that, I need the filling order.

From the path:

1: (0,0)

2: (1,0)

3: (0,1)

4: (-1,1)

5: (-1,0)

6: (-1,-1)

7: (0,-1)

8: (1,-1)

9: (2,0)  // assume it is filled next, even though not adjacent to 8, but perhaps in the actual path, it is after other cells, but in the sequence, it is next.

Then 10: (1,1)

11: (0,2)

12: (-1,2)

13: (-2,2)

14: (-2,1)

15: (-2,0)

16: (-2,-1)

17: (-1,-2)

18: (0,-2)

19: (1,-2)

20: (2,-1)

21: (2,0)  // but already 9, conflict.

After 8, if we go to (2,0):9, then from 9 at (2,0), to next. Neighbors: (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1), (1,0) filled, (1,1), (3,-1), etc.

In grid, (1,1) is 10, so perhaps to (1,1):10.

Then from 10 at (1,1) to (0,2) or (2,1) or (1,2), etc.

In grid, no, so assume to (0,2):11

Then to (-1,2):12

Then to (-2,2):13

Then to (-2,1):14 (since down)

Then to (-2,0):15

Then to (-2,-1):16

Then to (-1,-1):6 filled, so to (-1,-2):17

Then to (0,-2):18

Then to (1,-2):19

Then to (2,-1):20

Then to (2,0):9 filled, so to (2,1):21

Then to (3,0):22, etc.

So the number at (2,0) is 9, at (1,1) is 10, at (0,2) is 11, etc.

Now, to find a general formula for n at (q,r).

Notice that the rings are filled, but not in order of distance; cells at distance 2 are filled before all distance 1 are filled, but in this case, distance 1 cells are all filled by n=8, and distance 2 cells from n=6 onwards.

Cell at distance 2: (-1,-1):6, (2,0):9, (1,1):10, (0,2):11, (-1,2):12, (-2,2):13, (-2,1):14, (-2,0):15, (-2,-1):16, (-1,-2):17, (0,-2):18, (1,-2):19, (2,-1):20, (2,1):21, etc. 12 cells, but 6*2=12, so all distance 2 cells are filled from n=6 to n=21? 21-6+1=16 cells, but should be 12, so not.

 n from 6 to 21 is 16 cells, but distance 2 has 12 cells, so includes cells from other distances.

Cell at ( -1,-1) dist 2, n=6

(2,0) dist 2, n=9

(1,1) dist 2, n=10

(0,2) dist 2, n=11

(-1,2) dist 2, n=12

(-2,2) dist 2, n=13

(-2,1) dist 2, n=14

(-2,0) dist 2, n=15

(-2,-1) dist 2, n=16

(-1,-2) dist 2, n=17

(0,-2) dist 2, n=18

(1,-2) dist 2, n=19

(2,-1) dist 2, n=20

(2,1) dist 2, n=21

(3,0) dist 3, n=22? But (2,1) is dist 2, n=21, then (3,0) dist 3, n=22.

But there are more dist 2 cells: (1,0) is dist 1, already filled; (0,1) dist 1; all dist 1 are filled.

Dist 2 cells are those with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2.

For example, (2,0): max(2,0,2)=2

(2,1): max(2,1,3)=3? s= -2-1= -3, |s|=3, max(2,1,3)=3, dist 3, not 2.

Mistake.

For (2,1): q=2, r=1, s= -2-1= -3, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=3, max=3, distance 3.

For (2,0): max(2,0,2)=2

(2,-1): q=2, r= -1, s= -2-(-1)= -1, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=2, dist 2.

(1,1): q=1, r=1, s= -2, |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=2, max=2, dist 2.

(0,2): q=0, r=2, s= -2, max(0,2,2)=2

(-1,2): q= -1, r=2, s= -(-1)-2=1-2= -1, |q|=1, |r|=2, |s|=1, max=2

(-2,2): q= -2, r=2, s= -(-2)-2=2-2=0, |q|=2, |r|=2, |s|=0, max=2

(-2,1): q= -2, r=1, s= -(-2)-1=2-1=1, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=2

(-2,0): q= -2, r=0, s=2, max=2

(-2,-1): q= -2, r= -1, s= -(-2)-(-1)=2+1=3, |s|=3, max=3, dist 3

Oh, so ( -2,-1) is dist 3, not 2.

Similarly, (-1,-2): q= -1, r= -2, s= -(-1)-(-2)=1+2=3, |s|=3, max=3, dist 3

(0,-2): q=0, r= -2, s= -0-(-2)=2, |r|=2, |s|=2, max=2, dist 2

(1,-2): q=1, r= -2, s= -1-(-2)=1, |q|=1, |r|=2, |s|=1, max=2, dist 2

(2,-1): q=2, r= -1, s= -2-(-1)= -1, |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=2, dist 2

(2,1): dist 3, as above.

So dist 2 cells: all with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2.

The values: |q|<=2, |r|<=2, |s|<=2, but not all with max=2; for example (0,0) max=0, (1,0) max=1, etc.

Cells with max=2: |q|=2 or |r|=2 or |s|=2, and not less, but since s= -q-r, it's when the largest of |q|,|r|,|s| is 2, and the others less or equal.

For example, (2,0): |q|=2, |r|=0, |s|=2, max=2

(2,-1): |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=2

(1,1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=2, max=2

(0,2): |q|=0, |r|=2, |s|=2, max=2

(-1,2): |q|=1, |r|=2, |s|=1, max=2

(-2,2): |q|=2, |r|=2, |s|=0, max=2

(-2,1): |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=1, max=2

(-2,0): |q|=2, |r|=0, |s|=2, max=2

(-2,-1): |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=3, max=3>2, not

(-1,-1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=2, max=2, dist 2

(0,-2): |q|=0, |r|=2, |s|=2, max=2

(1,-2): |q|=1, |r|=2, |s|=1, max=2

(2,-1): already have

(2,1): |q|=2, |r|=1, |s|=3, max=3, not

(-1,-2): |q|=1, |r|=2, |s|=3, max=3, not

(1,-1): |q|=1, |r|=1, |s|=0, max=1<2, not

 etc.

So the dist 2 cells are: (2,0), (2,-1), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-1) wait (2,-1) already.

List all:

- q=2, r=0: (2,0)

- q=2, r= -1: (2,-1)

- q=1, r=1: (1,1)

- q=0, r=2: (0,2)

- q= -1, r=2: (-1,2)

- q= -2, r=2: (-2,2)

- q= -2, r=1: (-2,1)

- q= -2, r=0: (-2,0)

- q= -1, r= -1: (-1,-1)

- q=0, r= -2: (0,-2)

- q=1, r= -2: (1,-2)

- q=2, r= -1: already have

I have (2,-1) twice.

From above, also ( -1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

And (1,1), (0,2), etc.

Missing ( -2,-1) is dist 3, as |s|=3.

So the 12 cells are: let's list by (q,r):

 (2,0), (2,-1), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), and one more.

 (1,-1) is dist 1, already filled.

 (0,0) etc.

 ( -1,0) dist 1.

 (2,1) dist 3.

So only 11? No, must be 12.

 (1,0) dist 1.

Perhaps ( -2,-1) is dist 3, not included.

Let's calculate number.

For dist=2, the cells are those with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2.

This is equivalent to the set where the maximum of |q|,|r|,|s| is 2, and since s= -q-r, it's when the chessboard distance is 2.

Number is for each possible: when |q|=2, |r|<=2, |s|<=2, but with max 2, so |r|<=2, |s|<=2, but |s|=| -q-r| = | -2 -r| since |q|=2, so |2+ r| <=2, so -2<=2+ r<=2, so -4<=r<=0, and |r|<=2, so -2<=r<=0.

Similarly for other.

Standard way: the number of cells at distance exactly k is 6k for k>=1.

For k=2, 12 cells.

In our list, for q=2: r such that |r|<=2, |s|=| -2-r|<=2, and max=2.

| -2-r| <=2 means |2+r| <=2, so -2<=2+ r<=2, so -4<=r<=0, and |r|<=2, so r= -2,-1,0

For r= -2: s= -2-(-2)=0, |s|=0, max(|2|,| -2|,|0|)=2, good.

 r= -1: s= -2-(-1)= -1, |s|=1, max(2,1,1)=2, good.

 r=0: s= -2, |s|=2, max(2,0,2)=2, good.

Similarly for q= -2: r such |r|<=2, |s|=|2- r|<=2, so |2- r|<=2, -2<=2- r<=2, -4<=-r<=0, so 0<=r<=4, but |r|<=2, so r=0,1,2

 r=0: s= -(-2)-0=2, |s|=2, max2, good.

 r=1: s=2-1=1, |s|=1, max(2,1,1)=2, good.

 r=2: s=2-2=0, max(2,2,0)=2, good.

For r=2: q such |q|<=2, |s|=| -q-2|<=2, so |q+2|<=2, -2<=q+2<=2, -4<=q<=0, |q|<=2, so q= -2,-1,0

 q= -2: s= -(-2)-2=2-2=0, max(2,2,0)=2, good.

 q= -1: s= -(-1)-2=1-2= -1, |s|=1, max(1,2,1)=2, good.

 q=0: s= -0-2= -2, |s|=2, max(0,2,2)=2, good.

For r= -2: q such |q|<=2, |s|=| -q -(-2)|=| -q+2|<=2, so |q-2|<=2, 0<=q<=4, |q|<=2, so q=0,1,2

 q=0: s= -0-(-2)=2, |s|=2, max(0,2,2)=2, good.

 q=1: s= -1-(-2)=1, |s|=1, max(1,2,1)=2, good.

 q=2: s= -2-(-2)=0, max(2,2,0)=2, good.

For r=1: q such |q|<=2, |s|=| -q-1|<=2, and max=2, but since |r|=1<2, so |s| must be 2 or |q| must be 2.

Similarly for other r.

To avoid double-counting, better to list all combinations.

The cells are all (q,r) with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=2, s= -q-r.

This is equivalent to the set where the sum |q| + |r| + |s| = 4, since for hex grid, the distance d = (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, and d=2, so |q| + |r| + |s| = 4.

And since s= -q-r, |s| = |q+r|, so |q| + |r| + |q+r| = 4.

For each (q,r), this must hold.

For example, (2,0): |2| + |0| + |2+0| =2+0+2=4

(2,-1): |2| + |-1| + |2-1| =2+1+1=4

(1,1): |1| + |1| + |1+1| =1+1+2=4

(0,2):0+2+2=4

(-1,2):1+2+1=4

(-2,2):2+2+0=4

(-2,1):2+1+1=4

(-2,0):2+0+2=4

(-1,-1):1+1+2=4

(0,-2):0+2+2=4

(1,-2):1+2+1=4

(2,-1): already have

And ( -2,-1): | -2| + | -1| + | -2-1| =2+1+3=6>4, not

So the 12 cells are: (2,0), (2,-1), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2), and (1,-1)? (1,-1): |1| + | -1| + |1-1| =1+1+0=2<4, not.

 ( -1,0):1+0+1=2<4

 (0,0):0<4

 (0,1):0+1+1=2<4

So missing one. (2,1): |2| + |1| + |2+1| =2+1+3=6>4, not.

 ( -1,1):1+1+0=2<4

Perhaps (0,0) but no.

For ( -2,-1):6>4, not.

Perhaps (1,0):1+0+1=2<4

I think I have 11 cells: let's list:

From above: (2,0), (2,-1), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

That's 11 cells. But should be 12.

 (1,-1) is dist 1, not.

 (0,0) not.

 ( -1,0) not.

 (2,1) not.

Perhaps ( -2,-1) is dist 3, but |q|+ |r| + |s| =2+1+3=6, not 4.

For dist 2, |q|+ |r| + |s| =4.

Another cell: (0,0) s=0, sum 0.

 (1,0) s= -1, sum 1+0+1=2

 (0,1) s= -1, sum 0+1+1=2

 ( -1,1) s=0, sum 1+1+0=2

 ( -1,0) s=1, sum 1+0+1=2

 (0,-1) s=1, sum 0+1+1=2

 (1,-1) s=0, sum 1+1+0=2

 (2,0) s= -2, sum 2+0+2=4

 (2,-1) s= -1, sum 2+1+1=4

 (1,1) s= -2, sum 1+1+2=4

 (0,2) s= -2, sum 0+2+2=4

 ( -1,2) s= -1, sum 1+2+1=4

 ( -2,2) s=0, sum 2+2+0=4

 ( -2,1) s=1, sum 2+1+1=4

 ( -2,0) s=2, sum 2+0+2=4

 ( -1,-1) s=2, sum 1+1+2=4

 (0,-2) s=2, sum 0+2+2=4

 (1,-2) s=1, sum 1+2+1=4

 (2,-2): q=2, r= -2, s= -2-(-2)=0, |q|=2, |r|=2, |s|=0, sum 2+2+0=4, dist 2.

I missed (2,-2).

So (2,-2): dist 2.

So cells: (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-2)

Yes, 12 cells.

In our filling, we have (-1,-1):6, (2,0):9, (1,1):10, (0,2):11, (-1,2):12, (-2,2):13, (-2,1):14, (-2,0):15, (-2,-1):16, ( -1,-2):17, (0,-2):18, (1,-2):19, (2,-1):20, (2,-2):21, etc.

So for dist 2, filled from n=6 to n=21, but 21-6+1=16 >12, so includes other cells or duplicate.

 n=6 at (-1,-1), n=9 at (2,0), n=10 at (1,1), n=11 at (0,2), n=12 at (-1,2), n=13 at (-2,2), n=14 at (-2,1), n=15 at (-2,0), n=16 at (-2,-1), n=17 at (-1,-2), n=18 at (0,-2), n=19 at (1,-2), n=20 at (2,-1), n=21 at (2,-2)

So cells: (-1,-1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-1), (2,-2)

That's 14 cells, but dist 2 has only 12, and some are dist 3, like (-2,-1): |s|=3, dist 3, as |q|+ |r| + |s| =2+1+3=6, distance 3.

So not good.

I think I need to give up and look for a different approach or assume the path as per the initial grid and calculate for 2026.

Perhaps the sum of neighbors can be calculated using the fact that for a cell in the spiral, its neighbors are n±a, n±b, etc., but from 1, neighbors are 2,3,4,5,7,8, which are not symmetric.

For example, for cell n, the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and others.

In this case, for 1, n-1 not defined, n+1=2 is a neighbor, but 3 is not n+2, etc.

Perhaps for large n, in the interior, the neighbors are close in n, but on the boundary, not.

Perhaps for this grid, the number at (q,r) is given by a formula.

Let me try to find a formula for n in terms of (q,r).

From the filling order, it seems that the spiral fills in a way that for each ray from the center, the cells are filled in order.

Perhaps use the maximum of |q|,|r|,|s|, and then the angle.

For example, for a cell (q,r), compute d = max(|q|,|r|,|s|)

Then the number of cells with distance < d is S = 1 + 3d(d-1) for d>=1, with S(0)=1.

Then for cells at distance d, there are 6d cells.

Then the cell (q,r) has an index i in the ring, which can be determined by its direction from the center.

For example, the cell (d,0) is usually the start of the ring.

In this spiral, for d=1, start at (1,0):2

For d=2, start at (2,0):9

For d=0, (0,0):1

So for ring d, starts at (d,0) with number 2 + 3d(d-1) for d>=1? For d=1: 2+0=2, good; d=2: 2+3*2*1=8, but in our case (2,0) is 9, not 8.

8 is at (1,-1), dist 1.

So not.

Perhaps the number at (d,0) is 1 + 3d(d+1) or something.

For (0,0):1

(1,0):2

(2,0):9

(3,0): assume from earlier, after (2,-2):21, then to (3,0):22, as I had earlier.

So 1,2,9,22 for (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)

1,2,9,22, differences 1,7,13, so perhaps quadratic.

Assume n = a d^2 + b d + c for (d,0)

For d=0: c=1

d=1: a + b +1 =2, so a+b=1

d=2: 4a+2b+1=9, so 4a+2b=8

From a+b=1, 4a+2b=8, subtract 2*(a+b)=2, so 2a=6, a=3, b= -2

So n = 3d^2 -2d +1

For d=3: 3*9 -6 +1=27-6+1=22, good.

For (3,0):22, as assumed.

Now for other cells on the axis.

For example, (0,d): for d=1: (0,1):3

d=2: (0,2):11

d=3: (0,3): assume later.

n=3,11 for d=1,2

3,11, differences 8, so perhaps n = a d^2 + b d + c

d=1: a+b+c=3

d=2: 4a+2b+c=11

d=0: (0,0):1, but not on this ray, so not.

For (0,d), it may have a different formula.

From the values, for (0,1):3, (0,2):11, (0,3): say from path, after (2,-2):21, (3,0):22, then to (3,1):23, etc., or to (0,3): but likely later.

After 22 at (3,0), to (3,1):23, (2,2):24, etc., or to (0,3).

Assume that the number at (0,d) is different.

Perhaps for each cell, d = max(|q|,|r|,|s|), then the number is S(d-1) + offset, and offset depends on the relative position.

For example, for a given d, the cells are ordered in a specific way in the spiral.

From the path, for ring d, it starts at (d,0), then moves to (d, -1), then to (d-1, -1), etc., but in our case for d=2, starts at (2,0):9, then to (1,1):10, not (2,-1).

In our filling for d=2: starts at (2,0):9, then to (1,1):10, then to (0,2):11, then to (-1,2):12, then to (-2,2):13, then to (-2,1):14, then to (-2,0):15, then to (-2,-1):16, then to (-1,-1):6, but 6 is already filled, so in the path, it is filled earlier.

For the ring d=2, the cells are filled in the order: first ( -1,-1):6 (at n=6), then later (2,0):9, (1,1):10, etc., so not in a contiguous block.

To simplify, for a given n, find d such that S(d-1) < n <= S(d), with S(d) = 1 + 3d(d+1) the number within distance d.

S(d) = 1 + 3d(d+1)

S(0) =1

S(1) =1+3*1*2=7

S(2) =1+3*2*3=1+18=19

S(3) =1+3*3*4=1+36=37

S(4) =1+3*4*5=1+60=61

 etc.

For n=2026, find d such that S(d-1) < 2026 <= S(d)

S(25) =1+3*25*26=1+3*650=1+1950=1951

S(26) =1+3*26*27=1+3*702=1+2106=2107

Since 1951 < 2026 <= 2107, so d=26, distance 26.

Number of cells in the ring is 6*26 = 156.

The first cell in the ring is at n = S(d-1) +1 = 1951 +1 = 1952

So n from 1952 to 2107 in the ring.

Now, the cell at (d,0) = (26,0) is usually the start, with n=1952.

Then the spiral goes around.

For a cell in the ring, its neighbors may be in ring d-1, d, or d+1.

To find the position of n, it is at some (q,r) with max(|q|,|r|,|s|)=d.

The index in the ring is k = n - S(d-1)

For n=2026, k = 2026 - 1951 = 75

So the 75-th cell in the ring of 156 cells.

The ring has 6 sides, each with d cells for distance d.

For distance d, each side has d cells.

For example, d=1: 6 sides, each with 1 cell, total 6.

d=2: each side 2 cells, total 12.

Yes.

So for d=26, each side has 26 cells, total 6*26=156 cells.

The sides are between the axes.

The cell at (d,0) is the start of the ring, usually on the positive q-axis.

Then it moves in the direction of decreasing r or something.

In this spiral, from (d,0), it may move to (d, -1), or to (d-1,1), etc.

From our earlier small d, for d=2, (2,0):9, then to (1,1):10, which is not on the same side.

Perhaps it moves in the direction of the previous turn.

For large d, the exact path may not matter for the neighbor sum, as long as the cell is not on a corner.

For a cell in the middle of a side, its neighbors are predictable.

For example, for a cell on the positive q-axis, at (d,0), its neighbors are (d+1,0), (d,1), (d-1,1), (d-1,0), (d,-1), (d+1,-1) or something.

In general, for a cell at (q,r), its six neighbors are (q+1,r), (q,r+1), (q-1,r+1), (q-1,r), (q,r-1), (q+1,r-1)

Then for each, their distance may be d-1, d, or d+1.

For a cell at distance d, its neighbors may be at distance d-1, d, or d+1.

In particular, for a cell not on a "corner", most neighbors are at distance d, but in hex grid, for a cell at distance d, its neighbors can be at d-1, d, or d+1.

Specifically, if the cell is on the boundary of the ring, some neighbors may be in adjacent rings.

To find the sum, I need to know for each neighbor its number, which depends on its position.

Perhaps for a given cell at (q,r) with n, its neighbors have numbers close to n, but not necessarily.

Perhaps the sum is approximately 6n, but not exact.

For example, for n=1, neighbors sum 2+3+4+5+7+8=29, while 6*1=6, not close.

For n=2, neighbors: (2,0):9, (1,1):10, (0,1):3, (0,0):1, (1,-1):8, (2,-1): say later number.

In the grid, at (2,-1) not given, but from path, say 20 or something.

So not known.

Perhaps for the cell 2026, since it's large, and if it's not on the boundary, the neighbors are n-1, n+1, and others close, but in this spiral, the path may have cells not adjacent in n.

Perhaps the only way is to accept the filling order as per the initial grid and calculate.

From the path I had earlier, with from 8 to 9 at (2,0), then to 10 at (1,1), etc., and assume that for n=2026, we can find (q,r) by simulating or using a formula.

Perhaps the number n corresponds to the cell that is the n-th cell in the path, and the path can be generated by always turning left or right at each step.

From the initial moves, it turned right at each arrival.

From 1 to 2: move dir 0

Arrive at (1,0) from dir 3 (since came from (-1,0) relative, but from (0,0), so arrived from dir 3.

Then turn right to dir 2, move to (0,1):3

Arrive at (0,1) from dir 5 (since came from (1,0), vector (-1,1), so from dir (2
