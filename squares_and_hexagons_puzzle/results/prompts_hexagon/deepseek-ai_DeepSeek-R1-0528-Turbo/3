<think>
The problem involves a spiral on a hexagonal grid with natural numbers. I need to find the sum of the six neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out.

From the snippet:

... 14  4  3  10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...

It seems like the center is 1, surrounded by numbers in a hexagonal pattern. Let me sketch this out.

Assuming 1 is at the center. Directly to the right is 2, then above-right is 3, above-left is 4, left is 5, below-left is 6, below-right is 7, and so on. But looking at the numbers:

Around 1: it shows 5,1,2 on the middle row, and above it 4,3,10? That seems messy. Perhaps I should list the neighbors.

From the grid:

- Above 1: probably 3? But in the top row it's 14,4,3,10. Below: 16,6,7,8. And middle: 15,5,1,2,9.

This is confusing. Maybe the spiral starts at 1 and moves outwards.

I recall that in hexagonal grids, spirals can be tricky. Perhaps I should think about rings.

In many such spirals, the numbers are arranged in concentric hexagonal rings. The center is ring 0, containing only 1. Then ring 1 contains numbers 2 through 7? Let's see.

Typically, for a hexagonal grid, the number of cells in ring k is 6k for k>=1, and ring 0 has 1 cell.

Ring 0: 1 cell (number 1)

Ring 1: 6 cells (numbers 2 to 7)

Ring 2: 12 cells (numbers 8 to 19)

Ring 3: 18 cells (numbers 20 to 37)

And so on. The last number of ring k is 1 + sum_{i=1}^k 6i = 1 + 6*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 3k(k+1)

Sum from i=1 to k of 6i = 6 * k(k+1)/2 = 3k(k+1)

So last number of ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1)

Let me verify with small k.

For k=0: last number should be 1, formula gives 1 + 0 =1, ok.

k=1: 1 + 3*1*2 = 1+6=7, so numbers 2 to 7, yes 6 cells.

k=2: 1 + 3*2*3 = 1+18=19, numbers 8 to 19, 12 cells, yes.

k=3: 1+3*3*4=1+36=37, numbers 20 to 37, 18 cells, ok.

Now, in the given snippet, we have numbers up to 16, which is in ring 3? Ring 2 ends at 19, so 16 is in ring 2? Ring 2 has numbers 8 to 19.

But in the grid, we see 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,16. So probably ring 0:1, ring1:2-7, ring2:8-19.

In the snippet: middle row:15,5,1,2,9

Above:14,4,3,10? But 10 is probably not above, perhaps it's arranged differently.

Perhaps the grid is oriented with flat tops or pointy tops. I need to understand the layout.

Looking at neighbors of 1: from the grid, directly to the right is 2, to the left is 5, above-left is 4? Above is 3? Below is 6? Below-right is 7? But in the snippet, below 1 is 6? The middle row has 15,5,1,2,9. So left of 1 is 5, right is 2.

The row above: ...14,4,3,10... so probably above 1 is 3? But 3 is listed, and left of 3 is 4, but 4 should be adjacent to 1? Perhaps 4 is above-left of 1.

Similarly, below: ...16,6,7,8... so below 1 is 6? Right of 6 is 7, etc.

So let's assume the hexagon is oriented with two horizontal sides. So the neighbors of a cell are: left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right.

For cell 1:

- Right: 2

- Left: 5

- Up-right: 3? Since above is 3, but in hexagonal grid, if it's flat-top, then neighbors are left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right. But "up" might be ambiguous.

In flat-top hexagons, each cell has neighbors: NW, NE, E, SE, SW, W. Or something.

From the numbers: we see that adjacent to 1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Specifically, from snippet: 1 has left:5, right:2, and above it 3, so probably up-right is 3? But then what is directly above? In hexagonal grid, there is no "directly above" in the same way as square grid; it's offset.

Perhaps I can list the neighbors based on the grid.

From the snippet:

- Cell 1: neighbors? Left is 5, right is 2. Now above it, in the row above, there is 4 and 3. Since 4 is to the left of 3, and 1 is below and between them? In hexagonal grid, if rows are offset, then cell above-left might be 4, above-right might be 3.

Similarly, below: 6 and 7, with 6 left, 7 right, so below-left 6, below-right 7.

But is that correct? Let's see if they are adjacent.

For example, is 4 adjacent to 1? In the grid, 4 is above-left, and since the row above is shifted, probably yes.

Similarly, 3 is above-right, adjacent to 1.

5 is left, 2 is right, 6 is below-left, 7 is below-right.

But what about the sixth neighbor? In a hexagon, each cell has six neighbors. So for 1, neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7. But 7 is below-right, but in the snippet below is 6 and 7, but 7 might be adjacent.

In the bottom row: ...16,6,7,8... and middle is ...5,1,2... so below 1 is 6? But 6 is directly below? Or diagonally.

Perhaps I need to see the connections.

From the sequence, after 1 is 2, then probably 3,4,5,6,7, then 8,9, etc.

But in the spiral, it might spiral out.

I recall that in such spirals, the direction changes at the corners.

To find the neighbors of 2026, I first need to find where 2026 is located in the grid, specifically which ring and which position in the ring.

So, let's find which ring k contains 2026.

The last number of ring k is 1 + 3k(k+1)

Set 1 + 3k(k+1) >= 2026

So 3k(k+1) >= 2025

k(k+1) >= 675

Solve k^2 + k - 675 =0

Discriminant d=1+2700=2701

sqrt(2701), let's see 52^2=2704, 2704-2701=3, so sqrt(2701)≈51.97

So k≈ [-1 + 51.97]/2 ≈ 50.97/2 ≈25.485

So k=25 or 26?

Check k=25: 3*25*26=3*650=1950, so last number=1+1950=1951

k=26:3*26*27=3*702=2106, last number=1+2106=2107

2026 >1951, so in ring k=26? 1951 is last of ring 25, so ring 26 starts at 1952 and ends at 2107.

2026 is between 1952 and 2107, so yes, ring k=26.

Number of cells in ring k is 6k, so ring 26 has 6*26=156 cells.

Starts at 1952, ends at 2107.

The starting number is last of previous ring plus 1: last of ring 25 is 1951, so ring 26 starts at 1952.

Now, I need the position within the ring.

The ring is hexagonal, so it has six sides, each with k cells? For ring k, each side has k cells? Let me confirm.

For ring 1 (k=1), each side should have 1 cell? But ring 1 has 6 cells, and if it's a hexagon, each side has one cell, but since it's a ring, actually, in a hexagonal ring, the number of cells per side is equal to the ring index k.

For k=1: each side has 1 cell, total 6 cells, yes.

k=2: each side has 2 cells, total 12, yes.

k=3: each side has 3 cells, total 18, yes.

So for ring k, each side has k cells.

The ring starts at a certain position. Typically, in spirals, it starts from a specific direction.

In the snippet, we can see where it starts.

For example, ring 1: numbers 2 to 7.

Where is it placed? From center 1, it probably starts in the direction of the "right" or something.

In the snippet, after 1, next is 2 to the right. Then probably spirals counterclockwise or clockwise.

From 2, next might be above-right or something.

In the row above: 4,3,10? 3 is above 1, 4 is left of 3.

After 1 is 2 (right), then probably 3 (up-right), then 4 (up-left), then 5 (left), then 6 (down-left), then 7 (down-right), then 8 (down-right again? but ring 2 starts).

After 7, next should be ring 2, starting at 8.

In the snippet, below: ...16,6,7,8... so 7 is next to 8? So after 7 is 8, which is probably in the same direction or changing.

From the grid: middle row has 15,5,1,2,9. So left of 1 is 5, right is 2, and right of 2 is 9? But 9 should be in ring 2.

Similarly, above:14,4,3,10. Left of 4 is 14? But 14 is larger, probably ring 3.

Perhaps I need to see the sequence.

Assume that from the center, it moves right to 2, then turns left (counterclockwise) to the next direction.

In hexagonal grid, directions are 60 degrees apart.

Define the six directions. Let's say direction 0: right, direction 1: up-right, direction 2: up-left, direction 3: left, direction 4: down-left, direction 5: down-right.

In the snippet, from 1: right to 2 (dir 0).

Then next, probably to up-right, to 3 (dir 1).

Then to up-left? But up-left would be dir 2, but 4 is there.

After 2, it should go to the next number in the ring. Ring 1 has cells: after 2, it should be adjacent in the ring.

Typically, in a spiral, after placing the first cell of the ring, it moves in the direction perpendicular to the previous direction or something.

Standard way: after completing ring k-1, it moves to ring k by moving in the direction of the "start" direction.

In this case, from 1 (center), it moves right to place 2 (first cell of ring 1).

Then, to place the next cell, it moves in the next direction counterclockwise, which might be up-right, to place 3.

But in hexagonal grid, moving to a neighbor.

After placing 2, the next cell should be adjacent to 2 and not yet filled, and in the direction of the spiral.

From 2, it can move up-right to place 3, which is adjacent to both 1 and 2? In hex grid, cells 1,2,3 form a triangle, so yes, adjacent.

Then from 3, it can move up-left to place 4, adjacent to 3 and possibly 1? In the grid, 4 is adjacent to 1 and 3, yes.

Then from 4, move left to place 5, adjacent to 1 and 4.

Then from 5, move down-left to place 6, adjacent to 1 and 5.

Then from 6, move down-right to place 7, adjacent to 1 and 6.

Then ring 1 is complete.

Now for ring 2, it starts by moving right from 7? But 7 is down-right of 1, moving right would be to a new cell adjacent to 7 and 1? But 1 is already occupied, so probably it moves in a different direction.

Typically, after completing a ring, to start the next ring, it moves to the next direction or same direction.

In this case, after 7, it moves right to place 8? In the snippet, below: 7 and 8 are adjacent, and 8 is to the right of 7? In the bottom row, it's 16,6,7,8, so 6 left,7,8 right, so yes, 8 is to the right of 7.

So from 7 (down-right of 1), it moves right to place 8.

Then, since it's a new ring, it might continue in the same direction or turn.

After 8, next should be 9. In the middle row, right of 2 is 9, so probably 9 is up-right from 8 or something.

From 8, moving up-right would go to a cell above and right, which might be adjacent to 2.

In the grid, 9 is adjacent to 2 and 8? Probably.

Then from 9, it might move up-left or something.

The snippet shows 10 above, in the top row: ...3,10... so after 3 is 10? But 3 is ring 1, 10 is ring 2.

After placing 9, next is 10, which is probably up-left from 9 or up-right.

In the sequence, after 8 (bottom-right), move right to 8? Already did, then to 9 (which is above-right, dir 1), then to 10 (up-left, dir 2), then to 11 (left, dir 3), etc.

In the snippet, top row has 14,4,3,10. So left of 4 is 14? But 14 is larger, ring 3, so probably not adjacent.

Perhaps 10 is adjacent to 3 and 4? 3 and 4 are ring 1, 10 is ring 2.

In ring 2, each side has 2 cells.

The ring starts at 8, which is in the "south-east" direction or something.

Define the starting point.

The first cell of ring k is placed by moving in direction d_k from the last cell of previous ring or from center.

For ring 1, starts at 2, direction right (dir 0).

Then it places cells in order: first side: but since k=1, only one cell per side, so it places 2 (side 0), then turns to next direction, places 3 (side 1), and so on, up to 7 (side 5).

For ring k, it places k cells per side, and moves in the direction of the side.

Specifically, for each side, it places k cells while moving in a fixed direction for that side.

After placing a cell, it moves to the next cell in that direction.

After completing a side, it turns to the next direction (counterclockwise usually).

The turning direction: in this case, since after ring 1, it moved from 7 to 8 in the same direction as it was going? When it placed 7, it was moving down-right (dir 5), and after placing 7, it should turn to the next direction to start the next ring, but instead it moved in dir 0 (right) to place 8.

From 7, moving right (dir 0) is perpendicular? In hex grid, dir 0 and dir 5 are adjacent directions.

The sequence of directions: when starting a new ring, it moves in a direction that is rotated by 60 degrees or something.

Notice that from the last cell of ring k-1, to the first cell of ring k, it moves in a direction that is one step counterclockwise from the direction it was moving when it ended the previous ring.

At the end of ring 1, when it placed 7, it was moving in dir 5 (down-right) to place 7 (since from 6 to 7 is down-right).

After placing 7, to place the first cell of ring 2, it moves in the next direction counterclockwise, which is dir 0 (right), to place 8.

Then, for ring 2, it places k=2 cells in each direction.

So first side: direction dir 0 (right), place two cells: first is 8, then move right to place next cell. But in the snippet, after 8 is 9? But 9 is not in dir 0 from 8? In the grid, if 8 is below-right, moving right might go further right, but 9 is up-right, so probably not.

After placing 8, it turns to the next direction to place the next cell.

Standard hexagonal spiral: after placing the first cell of the ring, it then moves in the next direction for the next cell.

For ring k, it starts at a cell adjacent to the start of previous ring or something.

I recall that the first cell of ring k is at position (k,0) or something.

The distance from center: ring k has cells at distance k.

The position can be specified by ring k and a side s (0 to 5), and an index i from 0 to k-1 along the side.

But the starting point might be fixed.

From the snippet, for ring 2: numbers 8 to 19.

First cell is 8, which is adjacent to 7 (last of ring 1), and 7 is at dir 5 from center, so 8 is at dir 0 from 7, which is also dir 0 from center? Not exactly.

The direction from center.

For a cell in ring k, its position can be given by the direction from center and the step.

But it's radial, not Cartesian.

Perhaps use axial coordinates for hex grid.

I am considering that the spiral is such that the first cell of each ring is in the "east" direction, i.e., right.

For ring k, the first cell is at (k,0) in some coordinate.

Then, it moves in the six directions in order.

Specifically, for ring k, it starts at the "east" corner, then moves in the north-east direction for k cells, but since it's a ring, it's along the side.

For each side, it places k cells while moving in the direction of that side.

The sides are in order: for example, side 0: east (dir 0), but since it's a corner, it starts at the corner.

Typically, for a hexagonal ring, the first cell of the ring is at a corner, and it is the start of the first side.

The sides are: side 0: north-east (dir 1), side 1: north-west (dir 2), side 2: west (dir 3), side 3: south-west (dir 4), side 4: south-east (dir 5), side 5: east (dir 0), or something like that.

Let's see for ring 1: k=1, only one cell per side.

First cell: 2, which is east (dir 0) from center.

Then it moves to the next side: side 1, which is north-east (dir 1), places 3.

Then side 2: north-west (dir 2), places 4.

Side 3: west (dir 3), places 5.

Side 4: south-west (dir 4), places 6.

Side 5: south-east (dir 5), places 7.

Then ring 2 starts.

First cell of ring 2: 8, which is east from 7? 7 is at south-east, moving east would be dir 0.

In the grid, from 7 (down-right of 1), moving right (east) to 8.

So 8 is at dir 0 from 7, but relative to center, it is at (2,0) if we think coordinates.

Then for ring 2, it places two cells per side.

After placing 8, it turns to the next direction counterclockwise, which is dir 1 (north-east), and moves in that direction to place the next cell.

So from 8, move north-east to place 9.

In the snippet, 9 is to the right of 2, and 2 is north-east of 1, so 9 should be north-east of 8? If 8 is east of 7, and 7 is south-east of 1, so 8 is south of 1? Let's calculate positions.

Assume center at (0,0).

Let's use cube coordinates for hex grid.

In cube coordinates, each hex can be represented by (q,r,s) with q+r+s=0.

Directions: let's say:

- East: (1,0,-1)

- North-East: (1,-1,0)

- North-West: (0,-1,1)

- West: (-1,0,1)

- South-West: (-1,1,0)

- South-East: (0,1,-1)

Standard cube directions.

Now, from center (0,0,0), moving east (1,0,-1) to cell 2.

Then from 2, to place next, it moves north-east (1,-1,0)? But (1,-1,0) from (0,0,0) is (1,-1,0), but from (1,0,-1), moving (1,-1,0) would be (2,-1,-1), but that might not be adjacent.

Adjacent cells are one step in one of the six directions.

From a cell, moving in a direction to an adjacent cell.

In the spiral, when it places a cell, it moves to the next cell in the current direction, but after completing a side, it turns.

For ring k, it starts at a cell, then for each of the six sides, it moves in a fixed direction for that side and places k cells, but the first cell of the side is already placed or not.

Typically, for a ring, the first cell is placed, then for the first side, it moves in the direction of the side and places k-1 more cells, but since it's a ring, and k cells per side, but the corners are shared, so usually, each side has k cells, but the corner cells are included in one side only.

In hexagonal rings, each side has k cells, and corners are the start of each side.

For ring k, there are 6 corners, each corner is the start of a side.

The first cell of the ring is one corner, say the "east" corner.

Then it moves in the north-east direction (for example) and places k cells along that side, including the start cell? Or excluding.

Usually, when it says "places k cells in a direction", it means it moves k-1 times in that direction, placing a cell each time it moves, but the first cell is already placed.

Let's think.

For ring 1: k=1.

Start at east cell, which is cell 2.

Then, for side 0, it is at the corner, and since k=1, it places only this cell for this side. Then it turns to the next direction, say north-east, and moves to the next corner, placing cell 3.

But when it moves to the next cell, it places it at the new position.

In this case, from 2, it moves north-east to place 3.

Then from 3, moves north-west to place 4, and so on.

For ring 1, it moves 6 times, placing 6 cells, but the first cell is already placed before moving? No, typically, the spiral starts from center, places 1, then moves east to place 2, then from 2 moves north-east to place 3, then from 3 moves north-west to place 4, etc.

Yes.

After placing 7 (by moving south-east from 6), then for ring 2, it moves east from 7 to place 8.

Then from 8, it moves north-east to place 9.

Then from 9, it moves north-east again? But for k=2, it should place two cells in the north-east direction.

From 8, after placing 8, it moves north-east to place 9.

Then from 9, if it moves north-east again, it would place another cell, say 10, but in the snippet, after 9 is 10 in the top row, but is it north-east from 9?

In the grid, 9 is north-east of 8, and if 8 is east of 7, and 7 is south-east of 1, so let's assign coordinates.

Set center 1 at (0,0,0).

Move east to place 2 at (1,0,-1).

From 2, move north-east to place 3. North-east is (1,-1,0) from current? From (1,0,-1), moving north-east: the direction vector for north-east is (1,-1,0), but from (1,0,-1), adding (1,-1,0) gives (2,-1,-1), and q+r+s=2-1-1=0, ok.

Is this adjacent to 2? The vector from 2 to this cell is (1,-1,0), which is one of the six directions, yes.

Now, is it adjacent to 1? From 1 at (0,0,0) to (2,-1,-1), vector (2,-1,-1), which is not a unit vector, so not adjacent. But in the grid, 3 should be adjacent to 1. Problem.

I think I have a mistake.

In hexagonal grid, from a cell, moving in a direction goes to an adjacent cell, but when we move from 2 to 3, 3 should be adjacent to both 1 and 2, so it should be at a position that is adjacent to both.

From 1 at (0,0,0), 2 at (1,0,-1), then the cell adjacent to both should be at the "north" direction or something.

The cell that is north-east of 1 and east of 2? Let's see the common neighbor.

From 1, neighbors are:

- East: (1,0,-1) cell 2

- North-east: (1,-1,0) let's call this cell A

- North-west: (0,-1,1) cell B

- West: (-1,0,1) cell C

- South-west: (-1,1,0) cell D

- South-east: (0,1,-1) cell E

But in our case, after 2, it places 3 at north-east of 1, which is (1,-1,0).

Is this adjacent to 2? From 2 at (1,0,-1) to (1,-1,0), vector (0,-1,1), which is the north-west direction? Let's calculate the difference: q:1-1=0, r:-1-0= -1, s:0-(-1)=1, so vector (0,-1,1), which is the north-west direction from 2.

But in the spiral, we want to move north-east, but from 2, north-east is (1+1,0-1,-1+0)=(2,-1,-1), as I had earlier.

But (2,-1,-1) is not adjacent to 1, whereas in reality, 3 is adjacent to 1.

So in the actual grid, when it places 3, it is at (1,-1,0), which is north-east of 1, and from 2 at (1,0,-1), it is at (0,-1,1) relative? No.

From 2 (1,0,-1) to 3 (1,-1,0): delta q=0, delta r= -1, delta s=1, so it's the north-west direction, not north-east.

But in the spiral, after placing 2, it moves in the "next" direction, which is counterclockwise from the direction it came.

From center, it moved east to place 2. So the direction it was moving when it placed 2 is east.

Then, to place the next cell, it turns counterclockwise by 60 degrees, which is to north-east, but from the current cell, moving north-east would go to (2,-1,-1), but that is not adjacent to 1, and probably not in the ring.

Instead, it moves to the cell that is in the counterclockwise direction from the previous cell.

From 2, the counterclockwise neighbor from the center.

The neighbors of 2 are: the six directions.

- East: (2,0,-2)

- North-east: (2,-1,-1)

- North-west: (1,-1,0)  -- this is the cell at (1,-1,0), which is adjacent to 1.

- West: (0,0,-1) but this is center, occupied.

- South-west: (0,1,-2)

- South-east: (1,1,-2)

So the unoccupied neighbors are north-east (2,-1,-1), north-west (1,-1,0), south-east (1,1,-2), south-west (0,1,-2), and east (2,0,-2).

The counterclockwise from the incoming direction. It came from center, which is west of 2, since 1 is at (-1,0,1)? From 2, 1 is at (0,0,0), vector from 2 to 1 is (-1,0,1), which is west direction? West is (-1,0,1), yes.

So it came from west.

Then, counterclockwise from west: the directions are ordered, say clockwise or counterclockwise.

Assume the order of directions: let's list them in counterclockwise order: for example, east, north-east, north-west, west, south-west, south-east.

From a cell, the neighbors in counterclockwise order.

From 2, the neighbor from which it came is west (1).

Then next counterclockwise is south-west? Or north-west?

After west, counterclockwise might be south-west or north-west, depending on orientation.

In standard, for flat-top hexagons, counterclockwise from west: if west is left, then counterclockwise would be south-west (down-left), then south-east (down-right), etc.

But in this case, it moved to north-west, to (1,-1,0), which is up-left.

So probably the order is: east, north-east, north-west, west, south-west, south-east, or something.

From the move: from 1 to 2: moved east.

Then from 2 to 3: moved to (1,-1,0), which is north-west from 2, as vector (0,-1,1).

Vector from 2 to 3 is (0,-1,1), which is north-west direction.

Then from 3 to 4: 4 is at (0,-1,1)? From 3 at (1,-1,0), to 4, which is north-west of 1, at (0,-1,1).

Vector from 3 to 4: q:0-1= -1, r:-1-(-1)=0, s:1-0=1, so (-1,0,1), which is west direction.

Then from 4 to 5: 5 is at (-1,0,1), vector from 4 (0,-1,1) to 5 (-1,0,1): delta q= -1, delta r=1, delta s=0, so (-1,1,0), south-west direction.

Then from 5 to 6: 6 is at (-1,1,0), vector from 5 (-1,0,1) to 6 (-1,1,0): delta q=0, delta r=1, delta s= -1, so (0,1,-1), south-east direction.

Then from 6 to 7: 7 is at (0,1,-1), vector from 6 (-1,1,0) to 7 (0,1,-1): delta q=1, delta r=0, delta s= -1, so (1,0,-1), east direction.

Then from 7 to 8: 8 is the first of ring 2. From 7 at (0,1,-1), it moves east to (1,1,-2)? But earlier we have 8 in the grid, and from snippet, 8 is to the right of 7, and 7 is below-right of 1, so probably east, to (1,1,-2).

Vector (1,0,-1), east direction.

Then from 8 to 9: in the grid, 9 is to the right of 2, and 2 is at (1,0,-1), so 9 should be at (2,0,-2) or (1,-1,0) but those are occupied or not.

2 is at (1,0,-1), and 1 at (0,0,0), so north-east of 2 is (2,-1,-1), north-west is (1,-1,0) which is 3, etc.

8 is at (1,1,-2), then it moves to 9. In the snippet, 9 is adjacent to 2, and 2 is at (1,0,-1), so probably 9 is at (2,0,-2) or (1,0,-1) occupied, or (2,-1,-1), or (0,0,-1) occupied.

Perhaps (2,0,-2), east of 2? But 2 is at (1,0,-1), east would be (2,0,-2).

Then from 8 at (1,1,-2) to (2,0,-2): delta q=1, delta r= -1, delta s=0, so (1,-1,0), north-east direction.

Yes.

Then from 9 at (2,0,-2) to next cell 10. In the snippet, after 9 is 10 in the top row, and 3 is at (1,-1,0), so probably 10 is at (2,-1,-1) or (3,-1,-2), etc.

From 9, it should move in the next direction. It came from 8 by moving north-east (dir 1), so incoming direction is south-west? From 8 to 9: moved north-east, so from 8's perspective, it came from south-west, since vector from 8 to 9 is (1,-1,0), so from 9, it came from south-west? Vector from 9 to 8 is (-1,1,0), which is south-west direction.

Then counterclockwise from south-west: if directions are east, ne, nw, west, sw, se, in counterclockwise order.

From sw, counterclockwise is west or se? In counterclockwise order, after sw should be west, if we go sw -> west -> nw -> ne -> e -> se -> sw, but that's clockwise or counterclockwise.

Assume the order of directions: let's list them in counterclockwise order starting from east: east (1,0,-1), then north-east (1,-1,0), then north-west (0,-1,1), then west (-1,0,1), then south-west (-1,1,0), then south-east (0,1,-1), then back to east.

Yes.

So from a cell, the neighbors are in this order ccw: east, ne, nw, west, sw, se.

Now, when moving, from a cell, it came from a certain direction, then it moves to the next direction in ccw order.

For example, when at 9, it came from 8, which is in the south-west direction (since from 9 to 8 is sw).

So incoming direction is south-west.

Then next ccw from sw is west.

So it should move west to the next cell.

West from 9 at (2,0,-2) is (2-1,0,-2+1)=(1,0,-1), but that's cell 2, already occupied.

Problem.

Perhaps it moves to the next unoccupied neighbor in ccw order.

From 9 at (2,0,-2), neighbors:

- east: (3,0,-3)

- ne: (3,-1,-2)

- nw: (2,-1,-1)

- west: (1,0,-1) cell 2, occupied

- sw: (1,1,-2) cell 8, occupied (since it came from there)

- se: (2,1,-3)

So unoccupied are east, ne, nw, se.

The next in ccw order after sw (incoming) is west, but west is occupied, so it should go to the next, which is nw? After west is nw in ccw order? From sw, next is west, then nw, etc.

But west is occupied, so it might skip to nw.

So move nw to (2,-1,-1).

Then cell 10 at (2,-1,-1).

Then from 10, it came from se? From 9 to 10: from (2,0,-2) to (2,-1,-1), vector (0,-1,1), which is nw direction.

So from 10's perspective, it came from se, because vector from 10 to 9 is (0,1,-1), se direction.

Then next ccw from se is east.

So move east to (3,-1,-2)? But let's see if that makes sense.

In the snippet, after 10 is not shown, but later cells.

For ring 2, after 8 and 9, next is 10, then 11, etc.

From 10 at (2,-1,-1), move east to (3,-1,-2), place 11.

Then from 11, came from west (since from 10 to 11 is east, so from 11 to 10 is west), next ccw from west is sw? After west is sw in ccw order? From east, next is ne, etc.

From west, next ccw is sw, since order: ... west, sw, se, east, ...

After west is south-west.

So move sw to (3,0,-3)? From 11 at (3,-1,-2), sw is (3-1,-1+1,-2+0)=(2,0,-2), but that's cell 9, occupied.

Problem again.

Perhaps for the ring, after placing the first cell, it moves in a fixed direction for the side.

For ring k, it has six sides, each with k cells.

The first cell is at the start of the first side.

Then for each side, it moves in the side's direction and places k cells, but the first cell is already placed, so it moves k-1 times for that side, placing a cell each time it moves.

After placing the last cell of the side, it turns to the next direction (ccw) and moves to the first cell of the next side, but since it's a corner, it is shared, so it places it when it moves.

Let's try for ring 2.

Start at 8, which is at say (1,1,-2), as before.

This is the "south-east" corner or something.

Typically, the first cell is the "east" cell, but in this case, for ring 2, 8 is not east; east of center would be (2,0,-2), but 8 is at (1,1,-2), which is south-east.

Perhaps the first cell is in the "start" direction, which is the same as the last move of previous ring.

From 7 to 8, it moved east, so the first cell of ring 2 is in the east direction from the previous, but not from center.

For ring k, the first cell is at a distance k from center, in the same direction as the first cell of ring 1, which is east.

For ring 1, first cell 2 at (1,0,-1), east.

For ring 2, first cell should be at (2,0,-2), but in our case, it's at (1,1,-2), which is different.

(1,1,-2) has |q| + |r| + |s| /2 or in axial distance, the distance from center is max(|q|,|r|,|s|) or (|q| + |r| + |s|)/2, for (1,1,-2), |1|+|1|+|-2| =4, divided by 2 is 2, yes distance 2.

But (2,0,-2) also has |2|+|0|+|-2|=4, distance 2.

But in the grid, it's at (1,1,-2), not (2,0,-2).

So for the spiral, the first cell of ring k is not at (k,0,-k), but at a different location.

From the move, from 7 at (0,1,-1), moved east to (1,1,-2), so 8 at (1,1,-2).

Then for the side, it should place k=2 cells in some direction.

After placing 8, it turns ccw and moves to the next cell.

It turned to north-east, to 9 at (2,0,-2).

Then from 9, it should place another cell in the same direction or turn.

From 9, it moved to 10 at (2,-1,-1), which is north-west from 9, as vector (0,-1,1).

So it turned.

For ring k, after placing the first cell, it then for each of the six sides, places k cells in the side's direction, but the first cell of the side is already placed, so it places k-1 additional cells for that side by moving in the direction.

After placing the last cell of the side, it turns ccw and moves to the first cell of the next side, which is adjacent in the new direction.

For ring 2, start at 8 ( first cell).

Then for the first side, say side 0, direction dir 0 (east), but it just moved east to place 8, so for this side, it should move in east direction to place the next cell, but if it moves east from 8, to (2,1,-3), but in the grid, it went to 9 at (2,0,-2), which is not east.

Perhaps the side direction is not the move direction.

For ring k, the first side is in a certain direction.

From the pattern, for ring k, the first move is in the same direction as the last move of previous ring.

For ring 1, last move was from 6 to 7 in south-east direction? From 6 at (-1,1,0) to 7 at (0,1,-1), vector (1,0,-1), east direction.

Then for ring 2, first move from 7 to 8 in east direction.

Then after placing 8, it turns ccw to north-east, and moves to 9.

Then from 9, since it just moved ne, for this side, it should move in ne direction to place the next cell, so from 9 at (2,0,-2), move ne to (3,-1,-2), place 10.

Then from 10, it has placed two cells for this side? k=2, so for each side, it places k cells, but here for the second side, it placed 9 and 10, so two cells.

Then after placing 10, it turns ccw to the next direction, which is north-west (since after ne is nw), and moves to the next cell, say to (2,-1,-1), but that might be 11 or something.

From 10 at (3,-1,-2), move nw to (3-1,-1-1,-2+1)=(2,-2,-1)? Vector for nw is (0,-1,1), so from (3,-1,-2) + (0,-1,1) = (3,-2,-1).

Place 11.

Then from 11, move nw again? But for k=2, it should place only one more cell for this side? Since it already placed the first cell of the side at 11? When it moves to the first cell of the side, it places it, so for the side, it places k cells, including this first one.

For the north-west side, it places cells at (3,-2,-1) and then move nw to (3-1,-2-1,-1+1)=(2,-3,0), place 12.

Then after placing 12, turn ccw to west, move to (2-1,-3,0+1)=(1,-3,1), place 13, and so on.

In the snippet, for ring 2, we have cells up to 19, and in the grid we see 8,9,10, etc.

In the top row: 14,4,3,10. 4 and 3 are ring 1, 10 is ring 2, so 10 is at some position.

From above, if 10 is at (3,-1,-2), and 3 is at (1,-1,0), distance is not 1, so not adjacent, but in the grid, 10 might not be adjacent to 3.

In the snippet, 3 and 10 are in the same row, with 4 to the left of 3, so probably 10 is to the right of 3, so if 3 is at (1,-1,0), then east would be (2,-1,-1), or ne (2,-2,-0) etc.

Perhaps 10 is at (2,-1,-1), as I had earlier.

Let's list the cells for ring 2.

Start at 8: (1,1,-2)

Then move ne to 9: (2,0,-2)  [since (1+1,1-1,-2+0)=(2,0,-2)? vector ne is (1,-1,0), so (1+1,1-1,-2+0)=(2,0,-2), yes.

Then from 9, it should move in ne direction to place the next cell for this side. So move ne to (2+1,0-1,-2+0)=(3,-1,-2), place 10.

Then for this side, it has placed two cells: 9 and 10, so for the first side of ring 2, it is in ne direction, and has two cells.

Then after placing 10, turn ccw to nw direction, move nw from 10 to (3+0,-1-1,-2+1)=(3,-2,-1), place 11.

Then for this side, move nw again to (3+0,-2-1,-1+1)=(3,-3,0), place 12.

So cells 11 and 12 for nw side.

Then after placing 12, turn ccw to west, move west from 12 to (3-1,-3,0+1)=(2,-3,1), place 13.

Then move west again to (2-1,-3,1+1)=(1,-3,2), place 14.

Cells 13 and 14 for west side.

Then turn ccw to sw, move sw from 14 to (1-1,-3+1,2+0)=(0,-2,2), place 15.

Then move sw again to (0-1,-2+1,2+0)=(-1,-1,2), place 16.

Cells 15 and 16 for sw side.

Then turn ccw to se, move se from 16 to (-1+0,-1+1,2-1)=(-1,0,1), place 17.

Then move se again to (-1+0,0+1,1-1)=(-1,1,0), place 18.

Cells 17 and 18 for se side.

Then turn ccw to east, move east from 18 to (-1+1,1+0,0-1)=(0,1,-1), but this is cell 7, already occupied.

Problem.

18 is at (-1,1,0), move east to (0,1,-1), which is cell 7, occupied.

But it should place the first cell of the next side, but it's already occupied by ring 1.

Mistake.

After placing 18, it should move to the first cell of the next side, which is the east side, but in ring 2, the east side should be from 8 to somewhere, but 8 is already placed.

For the last side, after placing the last cell, it should close the ring.

In this case, after 18, it should move to a cell adjacent to 8 and 18.

18 at (-1,1,0), 8 at (1,1,-2), distance is large.

The cell that is south-east of 18 and north-west of 8 or something.

Perhaps the first cell of the ring is not included in the sides, or the sides are between corners.

For ring k, there are 6k cells, with 6 corners.

The corners are at the apices.

For example, for ring 2, corners at: east: say (2,0,-2), north-east: (2,-2,0), etc.

In our case, 8 is at (1,1,-2), which is not a corner; it's on the side.

Perhaps in this spiral, the first cell is not a corner.

From the snippet, for ring 2, we have in the grid: middle row: 15,5,1,2,9 so 9 is there, which is at (2,0,-2) in my earlier calculation.

Bottom row: 16,6,7,8 so 6,7,8.

6 is at (-1,1,0)? 7 at (0,1,-1), 8 at (1,1,-2).

Top row: 14,4,3,10. 4 at (0,-1,1), 3 at (1,-1,0), 14 and 10.

10 is probably at (2,-1,-1) or (3,-1,-2).

Assume 10 is at (2,-1,-1), as I had earlier for cell 10.

Then in the top row, left of 4 is 14, so 14 is west of 4? 4 at (0,-1,1), west would be (-1,-1,2), or nw (0,-2,2), etc.

Perhaps 14 is at (1,-3,2) or something.

To save time, I am considering that for a given number, I can find its ring and its angular position.

For a number n, find ring k such that the start of ring k is s_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1? Let's see.

Last of ring k-1 is 1 + 3(k-1)k

So start of ring k is 2 + 3(k-1)k

For k=1: 2 +0 =2, good.

k=2: 2 +3*1*2=2+6=8, good.

k=3:2+3*2*3=2+18=20, good.

k=26:2+3*25*26=2+3*650=2+1950=1952, as before.

Number of cells in ring k is 6k.

The ring is divided into 6 sides, each with k cells.

The cells are numbered consecutively along the ring.

The first cell of the ring is at a specific position.

From the move, when it starts the ring, it is at a cell that is in the "east" direction from the last cell of previous ring, but not from center.

For the first cell of ring k, it is located at a corner.

In this case, for ring 1, cells 2,3,4,5,6,7 are at the six corners.

For ring 2, cells 8 to 19, with 8,10,12,14,16,18 being corners or something.

In the snippet, we have 8,9,10,14,15,16, etc.

8 is at bottom-right, 9 at top-right, 10 at top, 14 at top-left, etc.

So probably for ring 2, the corners are 8,10,12,14,16,18.

For example, 8 at se corner, then 10 at ne corner, 12 at nw corner, 14 at w corner, 16 at sw corner, 18 at se corner, but se again? No, 18 should be at se, but 8 is at se, so perhaps not.

Perhaps the corners are every k cells.

Since each side has k cells, the corner cells are the first cell of each side.

For ring k, the first cell of the ring is the first cell of the first side.

Then after placing k cells for a side, it turns and places the first cell of the next side.

For ring 2, k=2.

Start at cell 8, first cell of first side.

Then it places k=2 cells for the first side. So it must place another cell in the same direction or something.

After placing 8, it moves in the side's direction to place the next cell for this side.

What is the direction of the first side? For ring k, the first side is in the north-east direction or something.

From earlier, for ring 2, after placing 8, it moved ne to 9, so perhaps the first side is in ne direction.

So for first side, direction ne, places 8 and 9? But 8 is already placed, so when it moves, it places 9.

So for the side, it places cell 8 (already placed), then move in the direction to place cell 9.

Then after placing 9, it has placed k cells for the side (8 and 9).

Then it turns ccw to the next direction, which is nw, and moves to place the first cell of the next side, which is 10.

So move nw from 9 to 10.

Then for this side, it places 10 and then move nw to place 11, and so on.

For each side, it places k cells: the first cell is placed when it moves to it (for the first cell of the side), or when it is already there for the first side.

In this case, for the first side, cell 8 is already placed before the side starts, so for the side, it places only the remaining k-1 cells? But for k=2, it would place only one cell for the first side, but we have two cells 8 and 9.

So perhaps when it says "places k cells for the side", it includes the cell it is at when it starts the side.

So for the first side, it starts at 8, then it places cell 8 (but it's already placed, so perhaps it doesn't place it again), then it moves in the side's direction to place cell 9.

So only one cell placed for the side, but k=2, should be two.

This is confusing.

Perhaps for each side, it places k cells by moving k-1 times in the direction, but the first cell is not placed during this; it is already there.

For a side, it starts at a cell, then it moves k-1 times in the side's direction, placing a cell each time it moves to a new cell.

So for a side, it places k-1 cells, but the first cell is already placed, so total k cells for the side.

For ring 2, first side: start at 8, then move in the side's direction (say ne) to place 9. So places one cell (9), and the side has cells 8 and 9.

Then after placing 9, it turns ccw to nw, and moves to the first cell of the next side, say to cell A, place A (10), then for this side, move nw to place 11, and so on.

In this case, for each side, it places k cells, but the first cell of the side is placed when it moves to it (except for the very first cell of the ring).

For ring 2, first cell 8 placed when it moved from 7 to 8.

Then for first side, it is at 8, and it needs to place k-1 =1 more cell for this side, so it moves in the side direction (ne) to place 9.

Then after placing 9, it turns ccw to nw, and moves to place the first cell of the next side, say 10 at (2,-1,-1).

Then for this side, it is at 10, and needs to place k-1=1 more cell, so move nw to place 11 at (2,-2,-0)? etc.

Then after placing 11, turn to west, move to place 12 at (1,-2,1) or something.

Then move west to place 13 at (0,-2,2), etc.

Then after placing 13, turn to sw, move to place 14 at (0,-1,1)? but that's cell 4, occupied.

Again problem.

Perhaps the directions are different.

Let's look at the numbers in the snippet.

From the grid:
Row above: 14,4,3,10
Middle: 15,5,1,2,9
Below: 16,6,7,8

So let's assume the hexes are arranged with flat tops, so each row is horizontal.

So the top row has cells at y=1 or something.

Cell 1 at (0,0)
Then above it, at y=1, cells are offset, so cells at x= -0.5,0.5 or something, but in axial coordinates, let's use (q,r).

Let me define axial coordinates with q and r.

Let center 1 at (0,0).

Then neighbors:
- east: (1,0)  cell 2
- north-east: (1,-1) cell 3
- north-west: (0,-1) cell 4
- west: (-1,0) cell 5
- south-west: (-1,1) cell 6
- south-east: (0,1) cell 7

In cube, if q,r,s with s= -q-r, then (q,r) axial corresponds to (q,r,-q-r) cube.

So 2 at (1,0) cube (1,0,-1)
3 at (1,-1) cube (1,-1,0)
4 at (0,-1) cube (0,-1,1)
5 at (-1,0) cube (-1,0,1)
6 at (-1,1) cube (-1,1,0)
7 at (0,1) cube (0,1,-1)

Yes, matches what I had.

Now for ring 2, cells 8 to 19.

8 is south-east of 7? 7 at (0,1), south-east would be (1,1) or (0,2), but in axial, directions:

- east: (1,0)
- ne: (1,-1)
- nw: (0,-1) or (-1,0)? Standard axial directions:

Usually:
- +q: east
- +r: south-east or south-west? Let's define.

From a cell, moving in +q direction: east
+ r direction: if r is the other axis, usually r is south-east or north-east.

In our case, from 7 at (0,1), it moved east to 8 at (1,1), since in the grid, 8 is to the right of 7.

So 8 at (1,1) cube (1,1,-2)

Then from 8, it moved to 9. In the grid, 9 is to the right of 2, 2 is at (1,0), so 9 at (2,0) or (1,-1) but (1,-1) is 3, occupied, so probably (2,0) cube (2,0,-2)

So moved from (1,1) to (2,0), which is vector (1,-1), which is the north-east direction, since ne is (1,-1) in axial.

Yes.

Then from 9 at (2,0), to 10. In the grid, 10 is to the right of 3, 3 at (1,-1), so 10 at (2,-1) or (1,-2), etc.

Probably (2,-1) cube (2,-1,-1)

So from (2,0) to (2,-1), vector (0,-1), which is not a unit vector; in axial, moving in r-direction.

The direction from (2,0) to (2,-1) is decrease r by 1, which is the north-west direction, since nw is (0,-1) in axial? Let's see the vector.

From (2,0) to (2,-1): delta q=0, delta r= -1, so vector (0,-1).

In axial coordinates, the six directions are:
- east: (1,0)
- north-east: (1,-1) or (0,1)? Standard is:
Usually:
- east: (1,0)
- north-east: (1,-1)  // for flat-top
- north-west: (0,-1)
- west: (-1,0)
- south-west: (-1,1)
- south-east: (0,1)

Yes.

So vector (0,-1) is north-west.

So from 9 to 10: moved north-west to (2+0,0-1)=(2,-1)

Then from 10 at (2,-1), to next cell 11. Probably move north-west again to (2+0,-1-1)=(2,-2), place 11.

Then from 11 at (2,-2), to next. After placing 11, it has placed two cells for this side? For ring 2, k=2, so each side has 2 cells. This is the second side, north-west direction, cells 10 and 11.

Then after placing 11, turn ccw to next direction, which after nw is west, so move west to (2-1,-2+0)=(1,-2), place 12.

Then for west side, move west again to (1-1,-2+0)=(0,-2), place 13.

Cells 12 and 13.

Then turn ccw to south-west, move sw to (1-1,-2+1)=(0,-1), but this is cell 4, occupied! (0,-1) is cell 4.

Same problem.

From 11 at (2,-2), move west to (1,-2), place 12.

Then from 12, move sw to (1-1,-2+1)=(0,-1), which is 4, occupied.

But 4 is ring 1, so should be free for ring 2? No, occupied.

So perhaps the move is not to (0,-1), but to (0,-2) or something.

After placing 11, turn to west, move to (1,-2), place 12.

Then for the west side, since it is in west direction, move west to (1-1,-2+0)=(0,-2), place 13.

Then cells 12 and 13 at (1,-2) and (0,-2).

Then from 13 at (0,-2), turn ccw to south-west, move sw to (0-1,-2+1)=(-1,-1), place 14.

Then move sw again to (-1-1,-1+1)=(-2,0), place 15.

Cells 14 and 15.

Then turn to south-east, move se to (-2+0,0+1)=(-2,1), place 16.

Then move se again to (-2+0,1+1)=(-2,2), place 17.

Cells 16 and 17.

Then turn to east, move east to (-2+1,2+0)=(-1,2), place 18.

Then move east again to (-1+1,2+0)=(0,2), place 19.

Cells 18 and 19.

Then turn to north-east, but the ring is complete, and it would move to (0+1,2-1)=(1,1), which is cell 8, already placed, good.

So for ring 2, cells:
- first side (ne): 8 at (1,1), 9 at (2,0)
- second side (nw): 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (2,-2)
- third side (w): 12 at (1,-2), 13 at (0,-2)
- fourth side (sw): 14 at (-1,-1), 15 at (-2,0)
- fifth side (se): 16 at (-2,1), 17 at (-2,2)
- sixth side (e): 18 at (-1,2), 19 at (0,2)

Now check with snippet.

In snippet, top row: 14,4,3,10

4 at (0,-1), 3 at (1,-1), so at y= -1, x from left to right.

14 is left of 4, so at x<0, y= -1? 4 at (0,-1), left (west) would be (-1,-1), which is cell 14 in this list, yes.

Then 4 at (0,-1), 3 at (1,-1), then 10 at (2,-1), which is to the right of 3, yes.

Middle row: 15,5,1,2,9

5 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), so at y=0.

15 is left of 5, so at x< -1, y=0? 5 at (-1,0), west would be (-2,0), which is cell 15, yes.

Then 5,1,2, then 9 at (2,0), which is right of 2, yes.

Bottom row: 16,6,7,8

6 at (-1,1), 7 at (0,1), 8 at (1,1), so at y=1.

16 is left of 6, so at x< -1, y=1? 6 at (-1,1), west would be (-2,1), which is cell 16, yes.

Then 6,7,8.

Perfect, matches the snippet.

So the spiral is as follows:

- Start at 1 (0,0)

- Move east to place 2 (1,0)

- Move north-east to place 3 (1,-1)

- Move north-west to place 4 (0,-1)

- Move west to place 5 (-1,0)

- Move south-west to place 6 (-1,1)

- Move south-east to place 7 (0,1)

- Then for next ring, move east from 7 to place 8 (1,1)

- Move north-east to place 9 (2,0)

- Move north-west to place 10 (2,-1)

- Move north-west to place 11 (2,-2)  // since for this side, it moves twice in nw direction

In general, for each side of ring k, it moves in a fixed direction for k steps, placing a cell each time it moves to a new cell.

After completing a side (k moves), it turns counterclockwise to the next direction and starts the next side.

The turn is after completing the side.

For ring k, it starts by moving in the same direction as the last move of previous ring.

For ring 1, last move was from 6 to 7 in south-east direction? From 6 (-1,1) to 7 (0,1), vector (1,0), east direction.

Then for ring 2, first move east to 8 (1,1)

Then for the first side, it moves in the current direction (east) for k=2 steps? But after placing 8, it should move east to next cell, but instead it turned to ne.

In the sequence, after placing 8, it moved to 9 in ne direction, not east.

So the direction for the side is not the same; it turns before starting the side.

After placing the first cell of the ring, it turns counterclockwise, then moves in the new direction for k steps.

For ring 2: placed 8 by moving east from 7.

Then turned ccw (from east, ccw is ne), then moved ne to place 9.

Then after placing 9, it has completed one move for this side, but for k=2, it needs to move more? No, it only placed one cell for this action.

Perhaps after turning, it moves k times in that direction.

For the first side of ring k, after placing the first cell, it turns ccw, then moves k times in the new direction, placing k cells.

But in this case, for ring 2, after placing 8, turn ccw to ne, then move ne to place 9 (first cell of side), then move ne again to place 10? But in our case, it placed 9, then moved nw to 10.

So not.

From the pattern, for each side, it places k cells by moving in the side's direction k times, but the first move places the first cell of the side.

For a side, it starts from a cell, but that cell is not placed during this side; it is already there.

In the move to the first cell of the side, it places it, then for the side, it moves k-1 more times in the side's direction.

For ring 2:

- First cell of ring: 8 placed when moving from 7 to 8 in east direction.

- Then for first side: direction ne. But it is at 8, so it needs to move in ne direction to place the next cell. So move ne to place 9.

Then after placing 9, it has placed one cell for this side (9), and the side has cells 8 and 9? But 8 is not placed during this side.

Perhaps the side includes the starting cell.

So for the first side, it has cells 8 and 9, and it placed cell 9 during the side.

Then after placing 9, it turns ccw to nw, and moves to place the first cell of the next side, which is 10.

So move nw from 9 to 10.

Then for this side, it is at 10, and it needs to place the remaining k-1=1 cell for this side, so move nw to place 11.

Then after placing 11, turn to west, move to place 12, and so on.

In this case, for each side, it places k cells, but the first cell of the side is placed when it moves to it at the beginning of the side, and then it places k-1 more cells by moving in the side's direction.

For ring k, number of cells placed per side is 1 (the first cell) + (k-1) = k, good.

And for the first cell of the ring, it is placed before the first side, so for the first side, it only places the additional cells.

In ring 2:
- First cell 8 placed.
- First side: direction ne, move ne to place 9. So places one cell (9), and the side has cells 8 and 9.
- Then turn ccw to nw, move nw to place 10 (first cell of second side).
- Then for second side, move nw to place 11. So places one cell (11), side has cells 10 and 11.
- Turn to west, move west to place 12.
- Move west to place 13. Side cells 12,13.
- Turn to sw, move sw to place 14.
- Move sw to place 15. Side cells 14,15.
- Turn to se, move se to place 16.
- Move se to place 17. Side cells 16,17.
- Turn to east, move east to place 18.
- Move east to place 19. Side cells 18,19.

Then the ring is complete.

And it matches the coordinates we have.

For general ring k, it starts by moving in the same direction as the last move of previous ring to place the first cell of the ring.

Then for each of the six sides, in order:
- Turn counterclockwise to the next direction.
- Move in that direction to place the first cell of the side.
- Then move in the same direction (k-1) times to place the next (k-1) cells of the side.

After the last side, it is ready for the next ring.

The direction sequence is fixed: after each side, it turns ccw to the next direction in the cycle: east, ne, nw, west, sw, se, and back to east.

The first move of the ring is in the last direction of previous ring, but for the first ring, it was east.

For ring 1: start by placing 1 at center. Then move east to place 2 (first cell of ring).

Then for first side: turn ccw to ne, move ne to place 3 (first cell of first side).

Then for this side, since k=1, k-1=0, so no additional move. So only place 3.

Then turn ccw to nw, move nw to place 4.

No additional move.

Turn to west, move west to place 5.

Turn to sw, move sw to place 6.

Turn to se, move se to place 7.

Done.

Good.

Now for our purpose, we need to find the position of 2026.

2026 is in ring k=26, as calculated earlier, since start of ring 26 is 1952, end is 2107.

Start s_k = 1 + 3k(k-1) for k>=1? Earlier: last of ring k-1 is 1 + 3(k-1)k, so start of ring k is 1 + 3(k-1)k + 1 = 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=26, s=2 + 3*26*25 = 2 + 3*650 = 2+1950=1952.

Number of cells in ring: 6*26=156.

2026 - 1951 = 75? 2026 - 1951 = 75, but 1951 is last of ring 25, so position in ring is 2026 - 1951 = 75? The first cell is 1952, so the index within the ring is from 0 to 155.

Cell 1952 is the first cell, position 0.

Cell 2026 is 2026 - 1952 = 74? 2026 - 1952 = 74, so index i = 74.

Since there are 156 cells, i from 0 to 155.

Now, the ring has six sides, each with k=26 cells.

The sides are traversed in order: after placing the first cell, it does six sides.

Each side has k cells, but as per above, for each side, it places k cells: the first cell is placed when moving to it at the start of the side, and then k-1 more cells.

The first cell of the ring is placed before the first side.

So for the entire ring, the cells are placed as follows:

- Cell 0: first cell of ring, placed by the initial move.

- Then for side 0: after turning, move to place cell 1 (first cell of side 0), then move (k-1) times to place cells 2 to k.

- Then for side 1: turn, move to place cell k+1, then move (k-1) times to place cells k+2 to 2k.

- Then for side 2: turn, move to place cell 2k+1, then move (k-1) times to place cells 2k+2 to 3k.

- Side 3: turn, move to place cell 3k+1, then move (k-1) times to place cells 3k+2 to 4k.

- Side 4: turn, move to place cell 4k+1, then move (k-1) times to place cells 4k+2 to 5k.

- Side 5: turn, move to place cell 5k+1, then move (k-1) times to place cells 5k+2 to 6k.

The last cell is cell 6k.

Since there are 6k cells, indexed from 0 to 6k-1.

In this sequence:

- Cell 0: first cell

- Side 0: cells 1 to k

- Side 1: cells k+1 to 2k

- Side 2: cells 2k+1 to 3k

- Side 3: cells 3k+1 to 4k

- Side 4: cells 4k+1 to 5k

- Side 5: cells 5k+1 to 6k

But cell 6k is the last, index 6k-1? Let's see the indices.

Cell 0: index 0

After that, side 0 places k cells: indices 1 to k? Since it places cells 1 to k, so indices 1 through k.

But k cells, indices 1 to k.

Then side 1: cells k+1 to 2k, indices k+1 to 2k.

Side 2: 2k+1 to 3k

Side 3: 3k+1 to 4k

Side 4: 4k+1 to 5k

Side 5: 5k+1 to 6k

Now the last index is 6k, but since indices start at 0, the cells are from 0 to 6k, which is 6k+1 cells, but should be 6k cells. Mistake.

For example, ring 2, k=2, cells 8 to 19, 12 cells.

Index i from 0 to 11.

Cell 0: 8 (first cell)

Side 0: cells 1 to k =1 to 2, so cells 9 and 10? But in our earlier, side 0 has cells 8 and 9? Inconsistency.

In our earlier for ring 2:

- First cell: 8

- Side 0 (ne): after turning, move to place 9 (cell 1), then since k-1=1, move again to place 10? But we placed only 9 for the side, and cells are 8 and 9 for first side.

In the sequence, after placing 8 (cell 0), then for side 0: turn, move to place cell 1 (9), then no more move since k-1=0? k=2, k-1=1, so should move again to place cell 2.

But in reality, after placing 9, it turned and moved to 10.

So for side 0, it placed only one cell: 9, but the side should have two cells.

Perhaps the first cell of the ring is included in the first side.

So for side 0, it starts with cell 0 already there, then it places k-1 cells for the side.

For ring 2: cell 0:8

Side 0: move in direction to place cell 1:9

Then done for side 0, cells 8 and 9.

Then side 1: turn, move to place cell 2:10

Then move to place cell 3:11

Cells 10 and 11.

Side 2: turn, move to place cell 4:12

Move to place cell 5:13

Side 3: turn, move to place cell 6:14

Move to place cell 7:15

Side 4: turn, move to place cell 8:16

Move to place cell 9:17

Side 5: turn, move to place cell 10:18

Move to place cell 11:19

So cells: 0:8, 1:9, 2:10, 3:11, 4:12, 5:13, 6:14, 7:15, 8:16, 9:17, 10:18, 11:19.

Indices from 0 to 11, good.

General: for ring k, cells indexed from 0 to 6k-1.

- Cell 0: first cell

- For side s (s=0 to 5):
  - Turn to direction d_s
  - Move to place cell (s*k + 1) ? Let's see the index.

After cell 0, for side 0, it places cell 1 (index 1)

Then for side 1, places cells 2 and 3 for k=2, but in general, for side s, it places k cells? In this case, for side 0, it placed only cell 1, but k cells should be placed, including cell 0.

Cell 0 is before side 0, so for side 0, only cell 1 is placed, but the side has cells 0 and 1.

So the cells of side s are from s*k to (s+1)*k - 1? For s=0: cells 0 to k-1

s=1: cells k to 2k-1

s=2: cells 2k to 3k-1

etc.

For ring k=2, s=0: cells 0 and 1: 8,9

s=1: cells 2 and 3:10,11

s=2: cells 4 and 5:12,13

s=3: cells 6 and 7:14,15

s=4: cells 8 and 9:16,17

s=5: cells 10 and 11:18,19

Yes.

The first cell of side s is cell s*k.

Then when it starts the side, it is at cell (s*k - 1)? No, when it begins the side, it is at the end of previous side.

After completing side s-1, it is at cell (s*k - 1)

Then it turns ccw to the direction for side s, then moves to place cell s*k (first cell of side s).

Then for the side, it moves (k-1) times in the same direction to place cells s*k +1 to (s+1)*k - 1.

In this case, for each side, it places k cells: the first by moving to it, then k-1 more by moving in the direction.

The direction for each side is fixed for the ring.

The directions are in order: for side s, direction d_s.

From the sequence, for ring k, the first move is in some direction, then for each side, it turns ccw to the next direction.

For ring 1, first move was east to place 2.

Then for side 0, turned to ne, moved to place 3.

Side 1: turned to nw, moved to place 4.

Side 2: turned to west, moved to place 5.

Side 3: turned to sw, moved to place 6.

Side 4: turned to se, moved to place 7.

For ring 2, first move was east to place 8.

Then for side 0, turned to ne, moved to place 9.

Side 1: turned to nw, moved to place 10.

Side 2: turned to west, moved to place 12? In our case, after placing 9 (end of side 0), it turned to nw, moved to place 10 (first of side 1).

The direction for side s is the (s)th direction in the cycle, starting from ne for s=0.

For both rings, side 0 is in ne direction.

Ring 1 side 0: moved ne to place 3.

Ring 2 side 0: moved ne to place 9.

Side 1: nw, to place 4 and 10.

Side 2: west, to place 5 and 12.

Side 3: sw, to place 6 and 14.

Side 4: se, to place 7 and 16.

Side 5: east, to place ? for ring 1, after se, turned to east, moved to place? But ring 1 ended at 7, no side 5 for ring 1 since only one cell per side.

For ring 1, after side 4 (se), it placed 7, then for side 5, it would turn to east, but there is no cell, since ring is complete.

For ring k, it has six sides, each with k cells.

The direction for side s is the direction corresponding to s in the cycle.

The cycle of directions: let's list them: d0: ne, d1: nw, d2: w, d3: sw, d4: se, d5: e.

For s=0: ne

s=1: nw

s=2: west

s=3: sw

s=4: se

s=5: east

Yes, as above.

The first cell of the ring is placed by moving in a direction that depends on the previous ring.

For ring 1, first cell 2 placed by moving east from center.

For ring 2, first cell 8 placed by moving east from 7.

For ring 3, start at 20, which is placed by moving east from 19? 19 is last of ring 2, at (0,2), moving east to (1,2), place 20.

Then for side 0: turn to ne, move to (2,1)? Place 21, etc.

The first move is always in the east direction for every ring.

Is that true? For ring 1: east.

Ring 2: east.

Ring 3: from 19 at (0,2), move east to (1,2), place 20.

Yes.

And the last move of each ring is in the east direction? For ring 1: last cell 7 placed by moving se to it, but when it placed 7, it was moving se, so last move is se.

For ring 2: last cell 19 placed by moving east to it? In our sequence, from 18 to 19, moved east to (0,2), so last move is east.

Inconsistent.

But for the first move of next ring, it is always east, as above.

So regardless of where it ended, it starts the next ring by moving east.

In this case, for any ring k >=1, the first cell is placed by moving east from the last cell of previous ring.

Then for the sides, it proceeds as above.

Now for a cell in the ring, given its index i (0 to 6k-1), we can find which side it is on and its position in the side.

The side s is floor(i / k)

Since each side has k cells, s = floor(i / k)

Then within the side, the position j = i mod k

j from 0 to k-1.

The first cell of the side is j=0.

Now, the cell is placed when moving in the direction of the side.

Specifically, for cell i, it is the j-th cell in side s.

The first cell of the side (j=0) is placed by moving in direction d_s to it.

Then for j>0, it is placed by moving in direction d_s from the previous cell.

In terms of coordinates, the position depends on the starting point of the ring.

The first cell of the ring is at a certain coordinate.

For ring k, first cell is placed by moving east from the last cell of ring k-1.

The last cell of ring k-1 is at a specific position.

Since the first cell of each ring is in the "east" direction, but at distance k.

For ring k, the first cell is at (k, 0) in axial coordinates? For k=1: (1,0), yes.

k=2: (1,1), but earlier we have (1,1) for cell 8, while (2,0) is cell 9, not first.

Not at (k,0).

From the move: from last cell of previous ring.

For ring k, last cell of ring k-1 is cell (6(k-1)-1) of ring k-1? For ring m, cells indexed 0 to 6m-1, last cell is index 6m-1.

For ring k-1, last cell is at index 6(k-1)-1 = 6k-7.

Its position depends on k.

The last cell of ring k-1 is on side 5, since s=5 has cells from 5k to 6k-1, so for ring m=k-1, cells from 5m to 6m-1.

The last cell is cell 6m-1, which is the last cell of side 5.

In side 5, which is east direction, and it is the last cell, so j=k-1.

For a cell in side s, position j, the coordinate can be found based on the starting point of the side.

The first cell of the side is at a corner.

For side s, the first cell (j=0) is placed by moving in direction d_s to it from the last cell of previous side.

The last cell of previous side is at the end of side s-1.

The coordinate of the first cell of the ring is fixed for each k.

From the pattern, for ring k, the first cell is at (k, k-1) or something? For k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,1)

k=3: first cell 20 at (1,2)? Earlier we said from 19 at (0,2) move east to (1,2), so (1,2)

So for k=1: (1,0)

k=2: (1,1)

k=3: (1,2)

So in axial coordinates, (1, k-1)

q=1, r=k-1.

Then for each side, it moves in the direction of the side.

The directions for the sides are:

s=0: ne, vector (1,-1)

s=1: nw, vector (0,-1)

s=2: w, vector (-1,0)

s=3: sw, vector (-1,1)

s=4: se, vector (0,1)

s=5: e, vector (1,0)

Now, for a cell in side s, position j (0 to k-1), the coordinate is the first cell of the side plus j times the direction vector.

The first cell of the side depends on s.

The first cell of the ring is at (1, k-1) for ring k.

Then for side s=0: first cell is cell 0 of the ring, at (1,k-1)

Then it moves in d0=ne (1,-1) to place the next cells.

So for cell with index i in side s, but since the first cell is already there, for the cells in the side, the coordinate is first cell + j * direction vector, for j=0 to k-1.

For side s=0, first cell is cell 0 of ring, at P0 = (1, k-1)

Direction d0 = ne = (1,-1)

So cell j in side 0: P0 + j * d0 = (1 + j, k-1 - j)

For j=0: (1,k-1)

j=1: (2,k-2)

etc.

For side s=1: first cell is cell k of the ring (since side 0 has cells 0 to k-1, so next is cell k)

Placed by moving in d1=nw=(0,-1) from the last cell of side 0.

Last cell of side 0 is cell k-1, at P0 + (k-1) * d0 = (1 + (k-1), k-1 - (k-1)) = (k, 0)

Then move in d1=nw=(0,-1) to place cell k at (k,0) + (0,-1) = (k,-1)

Since moving in (0,-1) to (k,-1)

So first cell of side 1: (k,-1)

Then for cell j in side 1: P1 + j * d1 = (k + j*0, -1 + j*(-1)) = (k, -1 - j)

j from 0 to k-1.

j=0: (k,-1)

j=1: (k,-2)

etc.

For side s=2: first cell cell 2k

Last cell of side 1 is cell 2k-1, at P1 + (k-1) * d1 = (k, -1 - (k-1)) = (k, -k)

Move in d2=w=(-1,0) to place cell 2k at (k-1, -k)

So P2 = (k-1, -k)

Then cell j: P2 + j * d2 = (k-1 - j, -k)

j=0: (k-1,-k)

j=1: (k-2,-k)

etc.

Side s=3: first cell cell 3k

Last cell of side 2: cell 3k-1 at P2 + (k-1) * d2 = (k-1 - (k-1), -k) = (0,-k)

Move in d3=sw=(-1,1) to place cell 3k at (0-1, -k+1) = (-1,1-k)

P3 = (-1,1-k)

Cell j: P3 + j * d3 = (-1 - j, 1-k + j)

Side s=4: first cell cell 4k

Last cell of side 3: cell 4k-1 at P3 + (k-1) * d3 = (-1 - (k-1), 1-k + (k-1)) = (-k, 0)

Move in d4=se=(0,1) to place cell 4k at (-k, 0+1) = (-k,1)

P4 = (-k,1)

Cell j: P4 + j * d4 = (-k, 1 + j)

Side s=5: first cell cell 5k

Last cell of side 4: cell 5k-1 at P4 + (k-1) * d4 = (-k, 1 + (k-1)) = (-k,k)

Move in d5=e=(1,0) to place cell 5k at (-k+1, k)

P5 = (1-k, k)  // since -k+1 = 1-k

Cell j: P5 + j * d5 = (1-k + j, k)

Now, for a given i, s = floor(i / k)

j = i mod k

Then coordinate depends on s.

Specifically:

- If s=0: q = 1 + j, r = k - 1 - j

- s=1: q = k, r = -1 - j

- s=2: q = k - 1 - j, r = -k

- s=3: q = -1 - j, r = 1 - k + j

- s=4: q = -k, r = 1 + j

- s=5: q = 1 - k + j, r = k

Now for our number 2026, ring k=26, index i = 2026 - 1952 = 74? 2026 - 1952 = 74, and since cells start at 1952 as index 0, so i=74.

k=26, so s = floor(i / k) = floor(74 / 26) = 2? Since 26*2=52, 74/26=2.846, floor=2.

26*2=52, 26*3=78>74, so s=2.

j = i - s*k = 74 - 2*26 = 74 - 52 = 22.

s=2, j=22.

For s=2: q = k - 1 - j, r = -k

k=26, j=22.

q = 26 - 1 - 22 = 25 - 22 = 3? 26-1=25, minus 22 is 3.

r = -26

So coordinate (q,r) = (3, -26)

In cube: (q,r,s) with s= -q-r = -3 -(-26) = -3+26=23, so (3,-26,23)

Now, we need the six neighbors.

In axial coordinates, neighbors are at:

- east: (q+1, r)

- north-east: (q+1, r-1)

- north-west: (q, r-1)

- west: (q-1, r)

- south-west: (q-1, r+1)

- south-east: (q, r+1)

So for (q,r) = (3,-26)

Neighbors:

1. east: (4,-26)

2. ne: (4,-27)

3. nw: (3,-27)

4. west: (2,-26)

5. sw: (2,-25)

6. se: (3,-25)

Now, each neighbor is at some ring, and we need to find the number at that position.

Since the grid is symmetric, and we have coordinates, we can find the ring of each neighbor.

The ring number for a cell at (q,r) is the distance from center, which in axial coordinates is ( |q| + |r| + |q+r| ) / 2? In cube, distance is max(|q|,|r|,|s|), but since s=-q-r, and in axial, the distance is max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|)? Actually, in axial, the distance is ( |q| + |r| + |q+r| ) / 2? For example, center (0,0):0

(1,0): |1|+|0|+|1+0|/2? (1+0+1)/2=1, good.

(1,-1): |1|+|-1|+|1-1|/2=(1+1+0)/2=1, good.

(1,1): |1|+|1|+|2|/2=(1+1+2)/2=4/2=2, good.

For our cell (3,-26), distance d = (|3| + |-26| + |3-26|)/2 = (3+26+| -23 |)/2 = (3+26+23)/2 = 52/2=26, which is ring 26, as expected.

Now neighbors:

1. (4,-26): d = (|4| + |-26| + |4-26|)/2 = (4+26+22)/2=52/2=26

2. (4,-27): d=(|4|+|-27|+|4-27|)/2=(4+27+23)/2=54/2=27

3. (3,-27): d=(|3|+|-27|+|3-27|)/2=(3+27+24)/2=54/2=27

4. (2,-26): d=(|2|+|-26|+|2-26|)/2=(2+26+24)/2=52/2=26

5. (2,-25): d=(|2|+|-25|+|2-25|)/2=(2+25+23)/2=50/2=25

6. (3,-25): d=(|3|+|-25|+|3-25|)/2=(3+25+22)/2=50/2=25

So neighbors at rings: two at ring 26, two at ring 27, two at ring 25.

Specifically:

- east (4,-26): ring 26

- ne (4,-27): ring 27

- nw (3,-27): ring 27

- west (2,-26): ring 26

- sw (2,-25): ring 25

- se (3,-25): ring 25

Now we need to find the numbers at these positions.

Since the spiral fills ring by ring, we can find for each neighbor its ring and position within the ring, then compute the number.

First, for neighbors at ring 25: sw (2,-25) and se (3,-25)

Ring 25, start number is 2 + 3*25*24 = 2 + 3*600 = 2+1800=1802? Earlier formula: start of ring k is 2 + 3k(k-1)

For k=25, s=2 + 3*25*24=2+3*600=2+1800=1802

Number of cells: 6*25=150

Now, for a cell in ring 25, coordinate (q,r), we can find s and j as before.

For (2,-25)

Distance is 25, as above.

s = floor(i/k) but we need i.

From the coordinate, we can find which side it is on.

Using the formulas for ring 25.

k=25

For a given (q,r), find s and j.

From the expressions:

s=0: q=1+j, r=k-1-j

s=1: q=k, r=-1-j

s=2: q=k-1-j, r=-k

s=3: q=-1-j, r=1-k+j

s=4: q=-k, r=1+j

s=5: q=1-k+j, r=k

Now for (2,-25)

Check s=0: q=1+j, r=25-1-j=24-j

Set q=2, r=-25

But r=24-j, and j>=0, r<=24, but -25<24, not equal.

s=1: q=25, r=-1-j

q=25, but we have q=2≠25.

s=2: q=25-1-j=24-j, r=-25

Set r=-25, good.

q=24-j=2 ⇒ j=22

s=3: q=-1-j, r=1-25+j=-24+j

Set r=-25, so -24+j=-25 ⇒ j=-1, invalid.

s=4: q=-25, r=1+j, q=2≠-25

s=5: q=1-25+j=-24+j, r=25

r=25≠-25

So only s=2, j=22

Now, index i for ring: i = s*k + j = 2*25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72

Since s from 0 to 5, i = s*k + j

j from 0 to k-1, so i from 0 to 6k-1.

Here k=25, i=2*25 + 22=50+22=72

First cell is index 0, so the number is start + i = 1802 + 72 = 1874

Start is 1802, index 0 is 1802, index 1 is 1803, ..., index i is 1802 + i

So 1802 + 72 = 1874

Now for the other ring 25 neighbor: se (3,-25)

q=3, r=-25

s=?

s=0: q=1+j=3 ⇒ j=2, r=24-j=24-2=22 ≠ -25

s=1: q=25, r=-1-j, q=3≠25

s=2: q=24-j, r=-25, q=24-j=3 ⇒ j=21, r=-25 good.

s=3: q=-1-j, r=-24+j, set r=-25 ⇒ -24+j=-25 ⇒ j=-1 invalid

s=4: q=-25, r=1+j, q=3≠-25

s=5: q=-24+j, r=25, r=-25≠25

So s=2, j=21

i = s*k + j = 2*25 + 21 = 50 + 21 = 71

Number = 1802 + 71 = 1873

Now for ring 26 neighbors: west (2,-26) and east (4,-26)

First, west (2,-26)

Ring k=26, start number 1952

Coordinate (2,-26)

Find s and j.

s=0: q=1+j, r=26-1-j=25-j

Set q=2, r=-26

q=1+j=2 ⇒ j=1, r=25-1=24 ≠ -26

s=1: q=26, r=-1-j, q=2≠26

s=2: q=26-1-j=25-j, r=-26

Set r=-26, good.

q=25-j=2 ⇒ j=23

s=3: q=-1-j, r=1-26+j=-25+j

Set r=-26 ⇒ -25+j=-26 ⇒ j=-1 invalid

s=4: q=-26, r=1+j, q=2≠-26

s=5: q=1-26+j=-25+j, r=26

r=26≠-26

So s=2, j=23

i = s*k + j = 2*26 + 23 = 52 + 23 = 75

Number = start + i = 1952 + 75 = 2027

But 2027 is larger than 2026, and ring ends at 2107, ok.

Now east (4,-26)

q=4, r=-26

s=0: q=1+j=4 ⇒ j=3, r=25-j=25-3=22 ≠ -26

s=1: q=26, r=-1-j, q=4≠26

s=2: q=25-j, r=-26, q=25-j=4 ⇒ j=21, r=-26 good.

s=3: q=-1-j, r=-25+j, set r=-26 ⇒ -25+j=-26 ⇒ j=-1 invalid

s=4: q=-26, r=1+j, q=4≠-26

s=5: q=-25+j, r=26, r=-26≠26

So s=2, j=21

i = 2*26 + 21 = 52 + 21 = 73

Number = 1952 + 73 = 2025

Now for ring 27 neighbors: ne (4,-27) and nw (3,-27)

Ring 27, start number s=2 + 3*27*26=2+3*702=2+2106=2108

Number of cells:6*27=162

Now (4,-27)

q=4,r=-27

s=?

s=0: q=1+j, r=27-1-j=26-j

Set q=4,r=-27

q=1+j=4 ⇒ j=3, r=26-3=23 ≠ -27

s=1: q=27, r=-1-j, q=4≠27

s=2: q=27-1-j=26-j, r=-27

Set r=-27, good.

q=26-j=4 ⇒ j=22

s=3: q=-1-j, r=1-27+j=-26+j

Set r=-27 ⇒ -26+j=-27 ⇒ j=-1 invalid

s=4: q=-27, r=1+j, q=4≠-27

s=5: q=1-27+j=-26+j, r=27

r=27≠-27

So s=2, j=22

i = s*k + j = 2*27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76

Number = start + i = 2108 + 76 = 2184

Now nw (3,-27)

q=3,r=-27

s=0: q=1+j=3 ⇒ j=2, r=26-j=26-2=24 ≠ -27

s=1: q=27, r=-1-j, q=3≠27

s=2: q=26-j, r=-27, q=26-j=3 ⇒ j=23

s=3: q=-1-j, r=-26+j, set r=-27 ⇒ -26+j=-27 ⇒ j=-1 invalid

Others not, so s=2, j=23

i = 2*27 + 23 = 54 + 23 = 77

Number = 2108 + 77 = 2185

Now summarize the neighbors:

- east (4,-26): 2025 (ring 26)

- ne (4,-27): 2184 (ring 27)

- nw (3,-27): 2185 (ring 27)

- west (2,-26): 2027 (ring 26)

- sw (2,-25): 1874 (ring 25)

- se (3,-25): 1873 (ring 25)

Now sum them up.

List:

2025, 2027, 1873, 1874, 2184, 2185

Sum = (2025 + 2027) + (1873 + 1874) + (2184 + 2185)

First pair: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

Second: 1873 + 1874 = 3747

Third: 2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now sum these: 4052 + 3747 = 7799

7799 + 4369 = 12168

Compute:

4052 + 3747:

4000+3700=7700, 52+47=99, total 7799

7799 + 4369:

7799 + 4000 = 11799

11799 + 369 = 11799 + 300 = 12099, +69=12168

So sum is 12168.

But let me double-check the numbers.

First, for sw (2,-25): ring 25, i=72, number=1802+72=1874

se (3,-25): i=71, 1802+71=1873

west (2,-26): ring 26, i=75, 1952+75=2027

east (4,-26): i=73, 1952+73=2025

ne (4,-27): ring 27, i=76, 2108+76=2184

nw (3,-27): i=77, 2108+77=2185

Now sum: 1873 + 1874 = 3747

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now 3747 + 4052 = 7799

7799 + 4369:

7800 + 4369 = 12169, but 7799 is one less, so 12169 - 1 = 12168? No:

7799 + 4369

Add: 7000+4000=11000

799+369: 800+369=1169 minus 1=1168? Better:

7799 + 4369 = (7800 - 1) + 4369 = 7800 + 4369 - 1 = 12169 - 1 = 12168

Directly: 7799 + 4369

9+9=18, carry 1

9+6+1=16, carry 1

7+3+1=11, carry 1

7+4+1=12, so 12168.

Yes.

Now, is this correct? We need to confirm if these are indeed neighbors of 2026.

First, what is the position of 2026.

We have it at (3,-26), ring 26, s=2, j=22, i=2*26 + 22=52+22=74, number=1952+74=2026, yes.

Now neighbors:

east: (4,-26), which we have as 2025

west: (2,-26), 2027

ne: (4,-27), 2184

nw: (3,-27), 2185

sw: (2,-25), 1874

se: (3,-25), 1873

In the grid, these should all be adjacent.

For example, distance between (3,-26) and (4,-26): delta q=1, delta r=0, which is east direction, adjacent.

To (2,-26): delta q=-1, delta r=0, west, adjacent.

To (4,-27): delta q=1, delta r=-1, ne, adjacent.

To (3,-27): delta q=0, delta r=-1, nw, adjacent.

To (2,-25): delta q=-1, delta r=1, sw, adjacent.

To (3,-25): delta q=0, delta r=1, se, adjacent.

All are adjacent, good.

Now the numbers seem consistent.

But notice that 2025 and 2027 are consecutive? 2025,2026,2027, but in the spiral, they might not be consecutive if not in the same ring.

2025 is east neighbor, 2027 is west neighbor, both in same ring 26.

In ring 26, i=73 and i=75, while 2026 is i=74, so yes, consecutive indices, so numbers 2025,2026,2027 are consecutive in the spiral? But i=73,74,75, numbers 1952+73=2025, 1952+74=2026, 1952+75=2027, yes, so they are consecutive numbers, which makes sense since they are adjacent in the grid and in the same ring, same side? s=2 for both, j=21,22,23? 2025: j=21, 2026: j=22, 2027: j=23, all on same side s=2.

Side s=2 is west direction, and they are moving west? Direction is west, vector (-1,0), so as j increases, q decreases, from j=21: q=25-21=4? Earlier for s=2: q=k-1-j=26-1-j=25-j

j=21: q=25-21=4, r=-26, yes (4,-26)

j=22: q=25-22=3, r=-26, our cell

j=23: q=25-23=2, r=-26, west neighbor.

So yes, in the same direction, consecutive cells, so consecutive numbers.

Similarly, the other neighbors are in adjacent rings.

Now sum is 1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185

We have 1873+1874=3747

2025+2027=4052

2184+2185=4369

Sum 3747+4052=7799

7799+4369=12168

To confirm, the two in ring 25: 1873 and 1874, which are consecutive? In ring 25, s=2, j=21 and 22? Earlier for (3,-25): j=21, (2,-25): j=22, same side s=2, so consecutive: i=71 and 72, numbers 1802+71=1873, 1802+72=1874, yes consecutive.

Similarly, in ring 27: (4,-27) j=22, (3,-27) j=23, same side s=2, i=76 and 77, numbers 2108+76=2184, 2108+77=2185, consecutive.

So all good.

Thus sum is 12168.

So the answer should be 12168.
</think>
The number 2026 is located in ring 26 of the hexagonal spiral grid. The rings are concentric, with ring \(k\) containing \(6k\) cells. The starting number of ring \(k\) is given by \(2 + 3k(k-1)\), so for ring 26, the starting number is \(2 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1952\). The index of 2026 within ring 26 is \(2026 - 1952 = 74\), so it is at position \(i = 74\) (with indices from 0 to 155).

Each ring is divided into six sides, each with \(k\) cells. The side \(s\) is determined by \(s = \lfloor i / k \rfloor\), and the position within the side \(j\) is given by \(j = i \mod k\). For \(k = 26\) and \(i = 74\):
\[
s = \lfloor 74 / 26 \rfloor = 2, \quad j = 74 - 2 \times 26 = 22.
\]
The coordinates in axial form \((q, r)\) for side \(s = 2\) are:
\[
q = k - 1 - j = 26 - 1 - 22 = 3, \quad r = -k = -26.
\]
Thus, 2026 is at \((3, -26)\).

The six neighbors of \((3, -26)\) in axial coordinates are:
- East: \((4, -26)\)
- Northeast: \((4, -27)\)
- Northwest: \((3, -27)\)
- West: \((2, -26)\)
- Southwest: \((2, -25)\)
- Southeast: \((3, -25)\)

The ring number (distance from center) for each neighbor is calculated as \((|q| + |r| + |q + r|)/2\):
- \((4, -26)\): ring 26
- \((4, -27)\): ring 27
- \((3, -27)\): ring 27
- \((2, -26)\): ring 26
- \((2, -25)\): ring 25
- \((3, -25)\): ring 25

The starting numbers for these rings are:
- Ring 25: \(2 + 3 \times 25 \times 24 = 1802\)
- Ring 26: \(2 + 3 \times 26 \times 25 = 1952\)
- Ring 27: \(2 + 3 \times 27 \times 26 = 2108\)

For each neighbor, the index \(i\) within its ring is found using the side and position:
- \((2, -25)\) (ring 25): \(s = 2\), \(j = 22\), \(i = 2 \times 25 + 22 = 72\), number \(= 1802 + 72 = 1874\)
- \((3, -25)\) (ring 25): \(s = 2\), \(j = 21\), \(i = 2 \times 25 + 21 = 71\), number \(= 1802 + 71 = 1873\)
- \((2, -26)\) (ring 26): \(s = 2\), \(j = 23\), \(i = 2 \times 26 + 23 = 75\), number \(= 1952 + 75 = 2027\)
- \((4, -26)\) (ring 26): \(s = 2\), \(j = 21\), \(i = 2 \times 26 + 21 = 73\), number \(= 1952 + 73 = 2025\)
- \((4, -27)\) (ring 27): \(s = 2\), \(j = 22\), \(i = 2 \times 27 + 22 = 76\), number \(= 2108 + 76 = 2184\)
- \((3, -27)\) (ring 27): \(s = 2\), \(j = 23\), \(i = 2 \times 27 + 23 = 77\), number \(= 2108 + 77 = 2185\)

The neighbors and their numbers are:
- East: 2025
- Northeast: 2184
- Northwest: 2185
- West: 2027
- Southwest: 1874
- Southeast: 1873

The sum is:
\[
1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2184 + 2185 = 12168
\]

\boxed{12168}
