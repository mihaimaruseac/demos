Let me break down the problem:

**Restatement:**  
Given a hexagonal grid in which the natural numbers are laid out in a spiral (1 in the center, then 2, 3, etc. spiraling outward), here is a sample:

```
     14  4  3 10
   15   5  1  2  9
     16  6  7  8
```
  
Question: **What is the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026?**

---

Let's analyze the spiral:

### **Step 1: Structure of the Hex Spiral**
The hex spiral grows as follows:
- Center: **1**
- First layer/ring: **2–7**
- Second layer/ring: **8–19**
- Third layer/ring: **20–37**
  
Let's figure out the general rangements for the rings:

#### For the \( n \)-th ring (with \( n = 0 \) at the center):

- The center (ring 0) is 1.
- The first ring (layer 1) surrounds the center: **6 numbers**.
- The second ring surrounds that: **12 numbers** (because each side is longer by one, and there are 6 sides).
- The k-th ring contains \( 6k \) numbers.

So the total number of numbers **encircled up to ring k** is:
\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6 \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
\]
\[
= 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

- Let's also check that with the above:
    - Ring 0: \( k=0 \) ⇒ 1
    - Ring 1: \( k=1 \) ⇒ \( 1 + 3(1)(2) = 7 \)
    - Ring 2: \( k=2 \) ⇒ \( 1 + 3(2)(3) = 1 + 3*6 = 19 \)
    - Ring 3: \( 1 + 3*3*4 = 1 + 36 = 37 \)

Those match.

### **Step 2: Find which layer/ring 2026 is in**

We want the smallest \( k \) such that \( 1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026 \).

- \( 3k^2 + 3k + 1 \geq 2026 \)
- \( 3k^2 + 3k - 2025 \geq 0 \)
- \( k^2 + k - 675 \geq 0 \)

Let's solve \( k^2 + k - 675 = 0 \):

\[
k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675}}{2}
= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

\( \sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96 \)
So \( k \approx \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} \approx 25.48 \)

Take **\( k = 26 \)** (since at \( k=25 \), the total is below 2026).

- For \( k=25: 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \)
- For \( k=26: 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \)

So **2026 is in ring \( k = 26 \)**.

### **Step 3: Find relative Location within ring 26**

The numbers on ring 25 end at 1951. So the first number on ring 26 is 1952, last is 2107.

- The positions on the ring are 1952 (start) through 2107 (end), 156 numbers (since \( 2107-1952+1=156 \)). As expected, 6 × 26 = **156**.

Now, 2026 is the **\( 2026 - 1951 = 75 \)th** number on the ring.

So, **counting from 1952, the 75th number is 2026**.

Recall: Each ring consists of 6 sides.

- Each side has \( k = 26 \) numbers.

The first side:
- Positions 1-26 (numbers 1952-1977)
Second side:
- Positions 27-52 (1978-2003)
Third side:
- Positions 53-78 (2004-2029)
Fourth side:
- Positions 79-104 (2030-2055)
and so on.

75 falls into side 3:
- Position within side: \( 75 - 52 = 23 \)
So 2026 is the **23rd position on the third side**, specifically:

- Side 1: 1952–1977
- Side 2: 1978–2003
- Side 3: 2004–2029

So \( 2026 = 2004 + 22 \), since 2004 is the first of side 3.

### **Step 4: Find the neighbors**

Any position not at the corner has these six neighbors:

- Two from the inner ring (previous ring)
- Two from the current ring (immediate neighbors along the side)
- Two from the outer ring (next ring)

Each side of the ring has the same structure. Let’s generalize the positions.

#### Ring \( k \), side \( s \), position \( p \) (with \( 0 \leq s < 6 \), \( 1 \leq p \leq k \)):

The first number on ring \( k \) is:
\[
n_{start} = 1 + 3(k-1)k
\]

For \( k=26 \), \( n_{start} = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1951 + 1 = 1952 \).

So, for side \( s \), position \( p \):
\[
n = n_{start} + s \cdot k + (p-1)
\]
So for \( p = 23 \), \( s = 2 \) (since side 3, with \( s=2 \)), \( k=26 \):

\[
n = 1952 + 2 \cdot 26 + 22 = 1952 + 52 + 22 = 2026
\]

So all matches up.

#### Now, neighbors:

Let's specify:
- **Previous ring:** ring \( k-1 = 25 \)
- **Current ring:** ring \( k = 26 \)
- **Next ring:** ring \( k+1 = 27 \)

**Key observation:** For a given number on the perimeter (not at corner), the 6 neighbors are:

1. Previous ring (inner, same side, same position)
2. Previous ring (inner, previous side, next position)
3. Same ring (current, previous position, unless first on side, then previous side)
4. Same ring (current, next position, unless last on side, then next side)
5. Next ring (outer, same side, same position)
6. Next ring (outer, next side, previous position)

Let's define:

Let’s compute the 6 neighbors for:
- Ring: \( k = 26 \)
- Side: \( s = 2 \) (0-based: first side is 0)
- Position on side: \( p = 23 \) (1-based, from 1 to 26)


#### (1) **Previous ring, same side, same position**
Ring \( k-1 = 25 \), side \( s = 2 \), position \( p = 23 \).
First number on ring 25: \( 1 + 3 \cdot 24 \cdot 25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801 \)
So:
\[
n_1 = 1801 + s \cdot 25 + (p-1) = 1801 + 50 + 22 = 1873
\]

#### (2) **Previous ring, previous side, position \( p = 23 \)**
Previous side: \( s = 1 \), position: if position > 1, position \( p = 23-1 = 22 \)
But to match it to the standard pattern, actually we want to neighbor the position right before on the previous side.

Check how the mapping occurred from ring to ring. **(Hex spirals can be complicated here; for simplicity, let's look at the pattern.)**

However, the key is that for side \( s \), position \( p \):

- Lower left neighbor is at ring \( k-1 \), side \( (s-1) \ (\mod 6) \), position \( p \) (unless \( p = 1 \), then it wraps).

So,

Previous ring, previous side (\( s=1 \)), same position \( p=23 \):

First number on ring 25: as before, 1801.

So:
\[
n_2 = 1801 + 1 \cdot 25 + (23 - 1) = 1801 + 25 + 22 = 1848
\]

#### (3) **Current ring, previous position**

If \( p > 1 \):
- Same ring, side \( s \), position \( p-1 \):
\[
n_3 = 1952 + 2 \cdot 26 + (23-2) = 1952 + 52 + 21 = 2025
\]

#### (4) **Current ring, next position**

If \( p < 26 \):
- Same ring, side \( s \), position \( p+1 \):
\[
n_4 = 1952 + 2 \cdot 26 + (23) = 1952 + 52 + 23 = 2027
\]

#### (5) **Next ring, same side, same position**
Ring \( k+1 = 27 \), side \( s = 2 \), position \( p = 23 \):

First number on ring 27: \( 1 + 3 \cdot 27 \cdot 28 = 1 + 2268 = 2269 \)
\[
n_5 = 2269 + 2 \cdot 27 + (23-1) = 2269 + 54 + 22 = 2345
\]

#### (6) **Next ring, next side, position \( p-1 \)**
Ring \( k+1 = 27 \), side \( s+1 = 3 \), position \( p-1 = 22 \):

\[
n_6 = 2269 + 3 \cdot 27 + (22-1) = 2269 + 81 + 21 = 2371
\]

---

### **Summary of the 6 neighbors:**

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(1) Previous ring, same side, same pos:} & 1873 \\
\text{(2) Previous ring, previous side, same pos:} & 1848 \\
\text{(3) Current ring, previous pos:} & 2025 \\
\text{(4) Current ring, next pos:} & 2027 \\
\text{(5) Next ring, same side, same pos:} & 2345 \\
\text{(6) Next ring, next side, previous pos:} & 2371 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Add up:
\[
1873 + 1848 + 2025 + 2027 + 2345 + 2371
\]

Let's sum:

\[
\begin{align*}
1873 + 1848 &= 3721 \\
2025 + 2027 &= 4052 \\
2345 + 2371 &= 4716 \\
\end{align*}
\]

\[
3721 + 4052 = 7773 \\
7773 + 4716 = 12489
\]

**Therefore:**

\[
\boxed{12489}
\]

**The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{12489}\).**
