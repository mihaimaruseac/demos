Let's carefully analyze the hexagonal spiral. From your diagram:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
..  15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Let's explicitly enumerate what's going on, then generalize.

## Step 1: Understanding the spiral

The numbers are laid out on a hex grid in a spiral starting at 1. The neighbors of any number in the spiral are the 6 adjacent hexagons.

Given how 1 is at the center, let's track the "rings" around it:

- **Ring 0**: center: 1
- **Ring 1**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers surrounding 1)
- **Ring 2**: 8, 9, ... up to 19 (12 numbers)

The counts:
- Center: 1
- 1st ring: 6
- 2nd ring: 12
- 3rd ring: 18, ...

The outer numbers per ring seem to follow \( 6 \times \text{ring number} \).

The pattern:
- Total numbers up to ring \( n \): \( 1 + 6(1 + 2 + \ldots + n) = 1 + 3n(n + 1) \)
- For ring \( n \) the max number is \( 1 + 3n(n+1) \)
- The lowest number on ring n is \( 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1 \)

Let's confirm with low \( n \):

- Ring 0: 1 (center)
- Ring 1: 2–7 = 6 numbers, sum so far: \(1 + 6 = 7\). \[n=1\] Max: \(1 + 3(1)2 = 7\)
- Ring 2: Next starts at 8 (should be \(1 + 2 \times 3 + 1 = 8\)), ends at \(1 + 3(2)3 = 19\). There are 12 numbers.

So the formula works.

## Step 2: Find the Ring number *n* where **2026** is

Let the total number at the end of ring n be \( S(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1) \).
Find \( n \) such that:
\[
S(n-1) < 2026 \leq S(n)
\]

Calculate:
\[
S(n) = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1
\]

Solve for \( n \):

\[
2026 \leq 3n^2 + 3n + 1
\]
\[
3n^2 + 3n + 1 \geq 2026
\]
\[
3n^2 + 3n \geq 2025
\]
\[
n^2 + n \geq 675
\]
\[
n^2 + n - 675 \geq 0
\]
Solve quadratic:
\[
n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2}
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2}
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]

Approximate \(\sqrt{2701}\):

52^2 = 2704

So, \(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96\)

\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} = \frac{50.96}{2} \approx 25.48
\]

So, ring 25 or ring 26.

Check values:

- \( S(25) = 1 + 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 26 = 1 + 3 \cdot 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \)
- \( S(26) = 1 + 3 \cdot 26 \cdot 27 = 1 + 3 \cdot 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \)

So ring 25 ends at 1951, ring 26 ends at 2107. 2026 is in ring 26.

The **first number** in ring 26 is \( S(25) + 1 = 1952 \).

### So, number 2026 is the 2026 - 1951 = 75th position on ring 26.

Each ring has \( 6n \) numbers; ring 26 has \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers.

So positions on ring 26 go from 1 to 156.

2026 is at position \( k = 2026 - 1951 = 75 \).

## Step 3: In the hex spiral, how are neighbors related?

The **neighbors** of a given number in the hex spiral at (ring n, position k) are:

- (n, k-1) [previous in same ring, wrapping around]
- (n, k+1) [next in same ring]
- (n-1, k') [corresponding position in inner ring]
- (n-1, k'+1) [next in inner ring]
- (n+1, K'') [two positions in outer ring: corresponding positions]

For each position k in ring n (starting from 1), the exact mapping between rings is important.

For a hex spiral, the adjacency works as follows:
- Each cell touches:
  - 2 in the previous ring
  - 2 in the next ring
  - 2 in the same ring (previous and next)

The mapping between (n, k) and the previous/next ring is as follows:

Suppose we fix a starting point (say, the "north" point, the first number in ring n).

Each ring has segments corresponding to the six sides, each of length n.

For ring n:
- total numbers: 6n
- positions: 1 to 6n, starting at an arbitrary reference point (say, "top" of the ring)

Now, for each segment (side), the relation to the inner/outer rings:

Let me make a table for the first few rings to be sure.

### Let's number positions in ring n from 1 to 6n, starting with the first after the completion of the previous ring.

- Ring 0: number 1
- Ring 1: numbers 2 to 7 (positions 1 to 6)
- Ring 2: numbers 8 to 19 (positions 1 to 12)

For ring n = 1, numbers 2 to 7
For ring n = 2, numbers 8 to 19

How do ring 1 positions map to ring 2 neighbors?

Let me pick an example: Ring 1, position 1 is number 2

- The numbers in ring 1, positions 1 to 6: 2 3 4 5 6 7

Ring 2 numbers: 8 to 19
- positions 1 to 12: 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

Trying to map neighbors:
- Number 2 (ring 1, pos 1): Its outer ring positions are those starting from 8.
- From spiral, after completing ring 1 at 7, ring 2 starts at 8 adjacent to 2.

From OEIS A054247 and math exchange, the mapping is:

- For ring n, position k (1-indexed from start of the ring), the 6 neighbors are:
    1. Next in same ring: k+1 (mod 6n)
    2. Previous in same ring: k-1 (mod 6n)
    3. Inner ring (n-1), position floor((k-1)/(n)) * (n-1) + mod(k-1, n-1) + 1   [for n > 1]
    4. Inner ring (n-1), position floor((k-1)/(n)) * (n-1) + mod(k, n-1) + 1   [adjacent]
    5. Outer ring (n+1), two positions: corresponding to k and k+1 in their respective segments.

This is more complex, but in each segment of n positions, the mapping goes as such:

### Let's generalize:

Each ring has 6 sides, each with n numbers.

For ring n, positions label them 1..6n.

- Side s: \( s = \text{floor}((k-1)/n) \) for k = 1..6n
- Offset within side: \( m = (k-1) \mod n \), m from 0 to n-1

For inner ring (n-1):
- Each side has n-1 positions

Which positions in ring n-1 are adjacent to position k in ring n?

- The two "inner" neighbors are:
  - side s, offset m in ring n-1: position \( (s \cdot (n-1)) + m + 1 \)
  - side s, offset m-1 (wraps): position \( (s \cdot (n-1)) + m \) (if m > 0), or last position of previous side (if m = 0)

Similarly for outer ring.

In total, for position k = s×n + m + 1 (s from 0 to 5, m from 0 to n-1):

- Same ring: k-1 and k+1 (modulo 6n)
- Inner ring: if n > 1:
    - if m < n-1: inner pos = s×(n-1)+m+1
    - if m > 0: inner pos = s×(n-1)+m
    - else (m = 0): previous side's last, i.e., ((s-1) mod 6)×(n-1) + (n-1)
- Outer ring (n+1):
    - per mapping: s×(n+1)+m+1, and s×(n+1)+m+2

Let’s formalize for our specific number.

## Step 4: Apply to \( n = 26,\, k = 75 \), number 2026

Ring \( n = 26 \)
- Number of numbers in this ring: \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \)
- Number 2026 corresponds to position \( k = 2026 - 1951 = 75 \) in ring 26

Let’s calculate **which side** and **offset**:

- Each side has 26 positions.

- \( s = \left\lfloor \frac{74}{26} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( m = 74 \mod 26 = 22 \)

So:

- **Side**: \( s = 2 \), this is the 3rd side (as s counts from 0)
- **Offset**: \( m = 22 \), i.e., 23rd position on side 2 (since m from 0)

Ring 26, position \( k = 2*26 + 22 + 1 = 75 \)

So, position 75 in ring 26, side 2, offset 22 (from 0), i.e., offset 23 from 1.

Similarly, now compute all six neighbors:

- **Same ring:**
    - Next: \( k+1 \) (with wrap around): 76
    - Previous: \( k-1 \): 74

- **Inner ring (n-1 = 25)**:
    - Inner ring has 25 positions per side, total 150.
    - Two neighbors:
        1. Same side, same offset (m < n-1): Since m =22, and 22 < 25, so use side 2, offset 22.
            - Position is \( 2 \cdot 25 + 22 + 1 = 50 + 22 + 1 = 73 \)
        2. Same side, offset m (should be from m-1): m > 0, so side 2, offset 21: position \( 2 \times 25 + 21 + 1 = 50 + 21 + 1 = 72 \)

- **Outer ring (n+1=27)**:
    - Outer ring positions per side: 27, total 162.
    - Side 2, offset m and m+1:
        - 1. s = 2, offset m =22: \( 2 \times 27 + 22 + 1 = 54 + 22 + 1 = 77 \)
        - 2. s = 2, offset m+1 = 23: \( 2 \times 27 + 23 + 1 = 54 + 23 + 1 = 78 \)

So our six neighbors in terms of positions are:
- Ring 26: k-1 = 74, k+1 = 76
- Ring 25: k = 73, k = 72
- Ring 27: k = 77, 78

Now, **what are their actual numbers?**

- Each ring starts at a certain number:

    - Ring n first number: \( F(n) = 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1 = 3(n-1)n + 2 \)
        - Confirm with ring 26: 3×25×26 + 2 = 1950 + 2 = 1952 (matches above; as earlier, 2026 - 1951 = 75, so 1952 + 75 - 1 = 2026).

So:

### Ring 26

- Starts at 1952

- k-1 = 74: position 74, number = 1952 + 74 - 1 = 1952 + 73 = **2025**
- k+1 = 76: position 76, number = 1952 + 76 - 1 = 1952 + 75 = **2027**

### Ring 25

- Starts at F(25) = 3×24×25 + 2 = 1800 + 2 = 1802

- k = 73: position 73, number = 1802 + 73 - 1 = 1874
- k = 72: position 72, number = 1802 + 72 - 1 = 1873

### Ring 27

- Starts at F(27) = 3×26×27 + 2 = 2106 + 2 = 2108

- k = 77: position 77, number = 2108 + 77 - 1 = 2184
- k = 78: position 78, number = 2108 + 78 - 1 = 2185

## Step 5: Write final neighbors and sum

Neighbors of 2026:

- **2025**, **2027** (same ring, previous and next)
- **1873**, **1874** (inner ring)
- **2184**, **2185** (outer ring)

Sum:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Let's sum them step by step:

Pairwise:

- 2025 + 2027 = 4052
- 1873 + 1874 = 3747
- 2184 + 2185 = 4369

Total:
\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799
\]
\[
7799 + 4369 = \boxed{12168}
\]

---

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

is the sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 in this hexagonal spiral.
