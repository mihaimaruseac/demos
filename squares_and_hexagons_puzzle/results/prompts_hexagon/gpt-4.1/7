Let's analyze the problem carefully.

## Understanding the spiral

The numbers are arranged in a spiral on a **hexagonal grid**. In such a grid, each cell (number) has 6 neighbors.

From the illustration:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Let's reconstruct the beginning of the spiral step by step to deduce a pattern.

### Spiral expansion

The spiral starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward.

It helps to look up or recall **hexagonal grid spiral numbering** (sometimes called an "hex spiral" or Sloane's OEIS A034943). The formula for finding the largest number in the nth "layer" (ring) is:

\[
\text{Max in ring } n = 1 + 3n(n-1)
\]

Ring 0: \(1 + 3 \cdot 0 \cdot -1 = 1\) (center)  
Ring 1: \(1 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 1\) ("ring 1" is center)  
Ring 2: \(1 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 1 + 6 = 7\)  
Ring 3: \(1 + 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 1 + 18 = 19\)  
Ring 4: \(1 + 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 1 + 36 = 37\)

But in many such conventions, the ring number \(r\) is such that the hexagon is "rings away" from the center, with the center as \(r=0\), first ring \(r=1\), and so on. The maximum number in ring \(r\) is:

\[
N_{\text{max}}(r) = 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]

Check:

- For \(r=0\): \(1\)
- For \(r=1\): \(1 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 7\)
- For \(r=2\): \(1 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 19\)
- For \(r=3\): \(1 + 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 37\)
- etc.

This matches the sequence in OEIS [A003215](https://oeis.org/A003215).

### Finding the ring for 2026

We want to find in which ring \(r\) the number 2026 lies.

\[
N_{\text{max}}(r) = 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]
Solve for \(r\) such that \(N_{\text{max}}(r-1) < 2026 \leq N_{\text{max}}(r)\):

\[
2026 \leq 1 + 3r(r+1)
\]
\[
2025 \leq 3r^2+3r
\]
\[
675 \leq r^2 + r
\]
\[
r^2 + r - 675 \geq 0
\]
\[
r = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675}}{2}
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96
\Rightarrow r \approx (51.96 - 1)/2 \approx 25.48
\]

Try \(r = 25\):

\[
N_{\text{max}}(25) = 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1951
\]

Try \(r=26\):

\[
1+ 3\times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

So:

- Max in ring 25: **1951**
- Max in ring 26: **2107**

Therefore, **2026** is in ring **26**.

#### How many numbers in ring \(r\)?

Each ring adds \(6r\) numbers (since the circumference of a hex is \(6 \times \text{radius}\)).

So:

- ring 1: numbers 2..7 (6 numbers)
- ring 2: numbers 8..19 (12 numbers)
- ring 3: numbers 20..37 (18 numbers)
- ring r: numbers from \(N_{\text{max}}(r-1)+1\) to \(N_{\text{max}}(r)\), so exactly \(6r\) numbers.

For ring 26:

\[
N_{\text{min}}(26) = N_{\text{max}}(25)+1 = 1951+1 = 1952
\]
\[
N_{\text{max}}(26) = 2107
\]

So numbers **1952** to **2107** are in ring **26** (**6 \times 26 = 156** numbers).

### Position within the ring

To find its neighbors, we need to know the position of 2026 within the ring. The arrangement is such that each ring has 6 sides, each with \(r\) numbers.

Let’s find the offset:

\[
\text{Index within ring} = 2026 - 1952 = 74
\]

This counts from 0 for 1952 to 155 for 2107.

Each side of the ring is of length 26 numbers.

- Side 1: offset 0–25 (positions 1952–1977)
- Side 2: offset 26–51 (1978–2003)
- Side 3: offset 52–77 (2004–2029)
- Side 4: 78–103
- Side 5: 104–129
- Side 6: 130–155

So 74 is within side 3.

- Side 1: 0..25
- Side 2: 26..51
- Side 3: 52..77

So, along the **third side**, at position \(74-52 = 22\) along that side (from the corner).

#### In a hex spiral, each number has 6 neighbors:

1. Two on the same ring (previous and next number)
2. One inner ring (same side)
3. Two inner ring (adjacent sides)
4. One outer ring (same position)

For such a structure, for a **not-at-a-corner** number, the 6 neighbors are:

- the two neighboring numbers on the same ring: **2025**, **2027**
- three numbers from the previous, inner ring (ring 25): Let's compute their numbers
- one number from the next, outer ring (ring 27): Let's compute this number

Let’s formalize the mapping between positions in the ring and in inner/outer rings.

#### Let's denote:

- \( r \): current ring (26)
- \( k \): offset along the ring (0 to \(6r-1\)), **k=74**
- Length of one side: \(r\)
- Which side: side \(S=\lfloor k/r \rfloor\)
- Offset along the side: \(s=k\mod r\)

Let’s define the index along the ring as \(k\), and map it to inner ring positions.

**Ring \(r\):** numbers from \(N_{\text{min}}(r) = 1 + 3(r-1)r+1 = 1 + 3(r-1)r \) to \(1 + 3r(r+1)\).
- (strictly, the first on ring \(r\) is at \(N_{\text{max}}(r-1) + 1\) )

#### Inner ring mapping

For each position on ring \(r\) (k), the neighbor on the inner ring is at position \(k'\) on ring \(r-1\), specifically, for positions not at corners, the mapping is 1:1.

Similarly, each element (not at the corners) has **three inner ring neighbors**:
- the ones at position \(k\), \(k-1\), and perhaps at \(k\) on the "previous" side

But let's make it explicit.

For the **hex spiral** (see [here for details](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/58965/formula-to-find-adjacent-cell-in-hex-grid)), the numbers are labeled as:

- Ring \(r\), number \(s\) along the side (\(s=0..r-1\)), side \(S=0..5\).

So, for our number:

- \(r=26\)
- \(k=74\)
- \(S= \lfloor 74/26 \rfloor = 2\) (third side)
- \(s = 74\mod 26 = 22\)

Let’s define \(k\) on ring \(r\):

\[
\text{Number} = N_{\text{max}}(r-1) + 1 + k
\]

For inner ring (\(r-1\)), the side length is \(r-1=25\), and there are \(6 \times 25 = 150\) numbers.

Which number(s) on inner ring neighbor our cell?

- On straight sides (not at a corner), each cell on ring \(r\) is adjacent to 1 cell on side \(S\) of ring \(r-1\), at offset \(s\), and 1 on previous side \(S-1\), at offset \(s= r-2\) (for the first cell on the side), and so forth.

Let’s generalize:

For a cell at \((r, S, s)\), its inner ring neighbors are:

1. The cell at \((r-1, S, s)\)
2. If \(s=0\), also the cell at \((r-1, S-1, r-2)\)
3. If \(s > 0\), also the cell at \((r-1, S, s-1)\)

Similarly, for outer ring neighbors.

Let's write down the full list of neighbors for a non-corner cell (\(s \neq 0\), not at the starting position on the side):

- Previous cell on ring \(r\): \(k-1\) (\(74-1=73\))
- Next cell on ring \(r\): \(k+1\) (\(75\))
- Inner ring, same side, same offset: \((r-1), S, s\)
- Inner ring, same side, previous offset: \((r-1), S, s-1\)
- Outer ring, same side, same offset: \((r+1), S, s\)
- Outer ring, same side, next offset: \((r+1), S, s+1\)

Let’s find the six neighbors by label and explicitly compute their numbers.

### Calculating 2026's neighbors

Our context:

- \(r = 26\)
- \(k = 74\)
- \(S = 2\)
- \(s = 22\)
- N\(_\text{min}(26) = 1952\)
- N\(_\text{min}(25) = 1802\)
- N\(_\text{min}(27) = 2108\)

Let’s confirm:

- N\(_\text{max}(25) = 1951\) (checked above), so N\(_\text{min}(26) = 1952\)
- N\(_\text{max}(26) = 2107\), so N\(_\text{min}(27) = 2108\)
- Ring 25: indices 0 - 149

#### The two neighbors on same ring:

- \(k = 74, \) so numbers \(1952 + 74 = 2026\)
- Previous: \(1952 + 73 = 2025\)
- Next: \(1952 + 75 = 2027\)

(Numbers 2025 and 2027)

#### The inner ring neighbors

Ring \(r-1=25\), side \(S=2\), offset \(s=22\)

The first number on ring 25 is 1802 (since N\(_\text{max}(24) = 1801\)). Each side has 25 numbers.

- The first number on side \(S=2\) is at position: \(1802 + 2 \times 25 = 1802 + 50 = 1852\)
- Offset along side: \(s=22\)
- So: \(1852 + 22 = 1874\)

So first inner neighbor: **1874**

Next inner neighbor: same side, previous offset (if \(s>0\)), so \(s=21\):

- \(1852 + 21 = 1873\)

So third neighbor: **1873**

Third inner ring possibility: (for completeness, if at \(s = 0\), neighbor on previous side at offset \(r-2=24\)). We’re at \(s = 22\), so not at corner.

#### The outer ring neighbors

Ring \(r+1=27\), side \(S=2\), offset \(s=22\); N\(_\text{min}(27)=2108\), each side has 27 numbers.

- Start of side \(S=2\): \(2108 + 2\times 27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162\)
- Offset: 22, so \(2162 + 22 = 2184\)
- Neighbor 1: **2184**

Next outer neighbor: same side, next offset (\(s+1 = 23\)):

- \(2162 + 23 = 2185\)
- Neighbor 2: **2185**

### Collect the six neighbors

- 2025 (previous on ring 26)
- 2027 (next on ring 26)
- 1874 (same side, same offset, ring 25)
- 1873 (same side, previous offset, ring 25)
- 2184 (same side, same offset, ring 27)
- 2185 (same side, next offset, ring 27)

#### **Sum**

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1874 + 1873 + 2184 + 2185
\]

Let’s calculate:

- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(1874 + 1873 = 3747\)
- \(2184 + 2185 = 4369\)

Sum:

\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799\\
7799 + 4369 = 12168
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

---  
**The sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is \(\boxed{12168}\).**
