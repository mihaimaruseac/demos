Let's analyze the **hexagonal spiral** and determine the sum of all 6 neighbors of the number **2026**.

---

**Step 1: Understanding the Spiral**

A **hex spiral** centers at \(1\) and spirals outward, each "shell" forming a larger hexagon.

- Center: 1
- First layer: numbers from 2 to 7 (\(6\) numbers)
- Second layer: numbers from 8 to 19 (\(12\) numbers)
- Third layer: numbers from 20 to 37 (\(18\) numbers), etc.

The number of numbers in the \(k\)-th layer (ring \(k\), starting from 1 for the ring around the center):
\[
\text{Ring } k: \text{Starts at } 1 + 3k(k-1) + 1, \text{ ends at } 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

But let's make it explicit:

- Ring \(0\): 1 (\(1\))
- Ring \(1\): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (\(2\) to \(7\), 6 numbers)
- Ring \(2\): 8, 9, ..., 19 (\(12\) numbers)
- Ring \(3\): 20, ..., 37 (\(18\) numbers)

**Number of numbers in ring \(k\):** \(6k\) (for \(k \ge 1\)).

**Largest number in ring \(k\):**
\[
1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 6\left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) = 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]
The starting number of ring \(k\) is one more than the end of ring \(k-1\):
\[
\text{Start}(k) = 2 \text{ if } k = 1, \quad 1 + 3 (k-1)k + 1 \text{ if } k \ge 1
\]

---

**Step 2: Find which ring 2026 is in**

The largest number in ring \(k\) is \(1 + 3k(k+1)\).

Set \(1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026\):

\(3k^2 + 3k + 1 \geq 2026\)

\(3k^2 + 3k \geq 2025\)

\(k^2 + k \geq 675\)

Solve \(k^2 + k - 675 = 0\):

Quadratic formula: \(k = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2}\).

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.97\)

So \(k \approx \frac{50.97}{2} \approx 25.49\)

So ring \(k=25\) ends at:

\[
1 + 3\times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1951
\]

\(k=26\) ends at

\[
1 + 3\times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

So **ring 26** runs from

- Start: \(2\) if \(k=1\), but for \(k=26\): start is \(1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 + 1 = 1951 + 1 = 1952\)
- End: \(2107\)

So the numbers in ring \(26\) are **1952 to 2107**, that's \(156\) numbers (\(6 \times 26 = 156\)).

---

**Step 3: Position inside ring**

For 2026: \(2026 - 1952 = 74\), so it's the **75th position** in the ring (since 1952 is the first).

Ring 26 has 156 numbers, starting from 1952 (1st) to 2107 (156th).

We need to determine the structure of the neighbors for this index.

---

**Step 4: Neighbors in the Hex Spiral**

On a hex grid, each cell has 6 neighbors:

- 2 neighbors in the same ring (previous/next, modulo \(6k\))
- 2 neighbors in the inner ring
- 2 neighbors in the outer ring

The formula for the numbers at each "vertex" of the ring is as follows:
Each ring is made up of 6 sides of length \(k\), so the **vertex positions** are:

- Vertex 0: start \(s = 1 + 3 (k-1) k + 1\) (already found above)
- Vertex 1: \(s + k\)
- Vertex 2: \(s + 2k\)
- Vertex 3: \(s + 3k\)
- Vertex 4: \(s + 4k\)
- Vertex 5: \(s + 5k\)
and back to the start after \(6k\)

Within each side, index increases by 1.

### Let's index the position:

Given \(k=26\), and 2026 is the \((2026 - 1952) + 1 = 75\)th in the ring.

Find which side and which step along the side:

Each side has \(k = 26\) steps.

- Side 0: positions 1..26  (1952..1977)
- Side 1: 27..52 (1978..2003)
- Side 2: 53..78 (2004..2029)
- Side 3: 79..104 (2030..2055)
- Side 4: 105..130 (2056..2081)
- Side 5: 131..156 (2082..2107)

75 lies in positions 53..78: side 2.

Position along side = 75 - 52 = 23.

So on side 2, position 23 (out of 26).

Start of side 2: position 53 = 2004.

So the \(p\)-th position on side \(s\), zero-based, is \(start + s \times k + p\).

Let's check that \(p = 22\) (since 75-53=22), but maybe we've got a 1-off.

- Side 2, position \(p = 22\): \(start = 1952\), so position = 1952 + 2*26 + 22 = 1952 + 52 + 22 = 2026

Confirming: Yes.

Thus, for **side 2**, position 22 (zero-based; position 75 overall).

---

**Step 5: Find the 6 neighbors of 2026**

Let N(2026) be the sum of the 6 neighbors.

- The two adjacent numbers in ring 26: \(2025\) (previous), \(2027\) (next).

- The two adjacent numbers in ring 25 ("inner neighbors")

    Let's find where 2026 sits relative to the inner ring (ring 25).

    The ring \(k=25\) runs from 1 + 3*24*25 + 1 = 1801 + 1 = 1802 to 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 (150 numbers).

    Side lengths = 25, positions per side: 25.

    The positions on side 2 of ring 25 are from position 51 to 75 (start at 1802 + 2*25 = 1802 + 50 = 1852, so side 2 is 1852 to 1876).

    For each position on ring k at side s position p (\(0 \leq p < k\)), its inner neighbors in ring \(k-1\) are:

    1. \(k > 1\): At side \(s\), position \(p\), the left inner neighbor is at side \(s\), position \(p-1\) (if \(p>0\)), otherwise at side \(s-1\), last of that side
    2. The right inner neighbor is at side \(s\), position \(p\) (on ring \(k-1\), which only has \(k-1\) positions per side)

    For ring \(k\), position \(p\) on side \(s\):

    - inner neighbor 1: ring \(k-1\), side \(s\), position \(\min(p, k-2)\)
    - inner neighbor 2: ring \(k-1\), side \(s\), position \((p-1) \mod (k-1)\)

    Let's plug in the values.

Here: ring 26, side 2, position 22 (\(p=22\)), \(k=26\)

- Ring 25: sides have \(25\) positions (\(p=0..24\))
- On side 2, position 22: neighbor at same side, position 22
- The "left" neighbor: if \(p=0\), would be previous side, position 24. But here \(p=22\), so neighbor at position 21.

Therefore, the inner ring neighbors are:

1. **Ring 25, side 2, position 22:** position = 1802 + 2*25 + 22 = 1802 + 50 + 22 = **1874**
2. **Ring 25, side 2, position 21:** position = 1802 + 50 + 21 = **1873**

---

- The two adjacent numbers in ring 27 ("outer neighbors")

    For outer ring, each side has \(k+1=27\) positions.

    Our current position is on ring 26, side 2 (\(s=2\)), position 22 (\(p=22\)), so:

    The two relevant positions in ring 27 are at side 2:

    - position 22 (aligned)
    - position 23 (to the right, as the next ring "shifts" outward at the vertices)

    Ring 27 starts at:

    \(start = 1 + 3\times26\times27 + 1 = 2107 + 1 = 2108\)

    Thus, side 2 on ring 27 begins at \(2108 + 2 \times 27 = 2108 + 54 = 2162\)

    So position 22 on side 2: \(2162 + 22 = 2184\)

    Position 23 on side 2: \(2162 + 23 = 2185\)

    So the outer ring neighbors are:

    - **2184**
    - **2185**

---

**Step 6: Collect the 6 neighbors**

\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{Previous in ring: }&2025 \\
&\text{Next in ring: }&2027 \\
&\text{Inner ring, side 2, pos 21: }&1873 \\
&\text{Inner ring, side 2, pos 22: }&1874 \\
&\text{Outer ring, side 2, pos 22: }&2184 \\
&\text{Outer ring, side 2, pos 23: }&2185 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Sum them:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2184 + 2185 = 
\]
\[
= (2025 + 2027) + (1873 + 1874) + (2184 + 2185)
\]
\[
= 4052 + 3747 + 4369
\]
\[
= 4052 + 3747 = 7799
\]
\[
7799 + 4369 = 12168
\]

---

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12168}
\]

The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number **2026** in the hexagonal spiral is \(\boxed{12168}\).
