Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### **Understanding the Layout**

A **hexagonal spiral** means:

- The numbers spiral outward from the center (1).
- Each cell (after the center) has 6 neighbors except at the "end" of each ring.

From the description, the initial numbers are placed like this:

```
   14  4  3 10
  15  5  1  2  9
   16  6  7  8
```
The spiral proceeds outwards in "rings".

### **Hexagonal Rings Formulas**

On a hexagonal grid:

- The center/starting point ("ring 0") = 1.
- The first ring ("ring 1") = the 6 numbers surrounding the center: that is, numbers 2–7.
- The second ring ("ring 2") = next 12 numbers, 8–19.
- The third ring ("ring 3") = next 18 numbers, 20–37.
- In general:
    - The **n-th ring** contains \( 6n \) numbers.
    - The total number of numbers up to ring \( n \) is \( 1 + 6(1 + 2 + \cdots + n) = 1 + 3n(n+1) \).

So, for **ring \( n \)**:
- Maximum number (last in the ring): \( 1 + 3n(n+1) \).
- Minimum number (first in the ring): \( 1 + 3(n-1)n + 1 = 3n^2 - 3n + 2 \).
  - (Since the previous ring ended at \( 1 + 3(n-1)n \), so the next starts at \( +1 \).)

### **Find Out in Which Ring 2026 Lies**

Let \( 1 + 3n(n+1) \geq 2026 \).

Set \( N = 1 + 3n(n+1) \).

Solve for \( n \):

1. \( 3n(n+1) \geq 2025 \)
2. \( n(n+1) \geq 675 \)

Try \( n = 26 \):

- \( 26 \times 27 = 702 \), which is **greater than 675**.

The maximum number in ring 26 is:
- \( 1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107 \).

The maximum in ring 25 is:
- \( 1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951 \).

So the numbers in ring 26 range from **1952** to **2107** (inclusive).

Thus, **2026 lies in ring 26**.

- To find where in the ring: \( 2026 - 1952 = 74 \): it's the 75th number in the ring.

### **Neighbors in the Hex Spiral**

For a cell in "ring n", its 6 neighbors are:

- the cells directly adjacent in all 6 lattice directions.
- For non-corner cells in a ring, the 6 neighbors are:
    - The previous number in the same ring.
    - The next number in the same ring.
    - 2 numbers in the **previous ring (n-1)**.
    - 2 numbers in the **next ring (n+1)**.

Let's recall the structure:
- Each ring is a hexagon built with \( 6n \) cells, broken into 6 sides of \( n \) numbers each.
- The walk around the ring starts at a "corner," proceeds \( n \) numbers to the next corner, etc.

Every ring has 6 corners, each separated by \( n \) steps.

75th position in a ring of 156 (\( 6 \times 26 = 156 \)) means it's not a corner.

Specifically:
- Position in ring: 75. So, the positions around the ring are labeled 0, 1, ..., 155.
- Position 75 is Side \( \left\lfloor 75 / 26 \right\rfloor = 2 \), position within side = \( 75 \bmod 26 = 23 \).

So:
- Side 0: positions 0–25
- Side 1: positions 26–51
- Side 2: positions 52–77
- Side 3: 78–103
- Side 4: 104–129
- Side 5: 130–155

So position **75**: **Side 2, position 23 on the side**.

### **Finding Neighbor Numbers**

For a "general" (not-corner) cell, its 6 neighbors are:

#### 1. Previous and next cell in the same ring
- \( 2026 - 1 = 2025 \)
- \( 2026 + 1 = 2027 \)

#### 2. Two cells in the previous ring (ring 25)
Key insight: In the _spiral_, from a given cell on ring \( n \), moving inward in one of two directions brings you to a cell in ring \( n-1 \).

For each cell in ring \( n \), its position around the hexagon (say numbered 0 to \( 6n-1 \)). For position \( k \) on ring \( n \):

- The corresponding cells in ring \( n-1 \) are positions \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \times (n-1) \right\rfloor + (k \bmod n) \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \times (n-1) \right\rfloor + (k \bmod n) + 1 \), but let's make it explicit.

**A shortcut:**
According to OEIS [A056105](https://oeis.org/A056105), the hex spiral numbering, the 6 neighbors of number at \((n, k)\) are:
- \((n, k + 1)\), \((n, k - 1)\) (adjacent on the same ring)
- \((n-1, k')\) and \((n-1, k'+1)\)
- \((n+1, k'')\) and \((n+1, k''+1)\)

Where:
- \( n \) is the ring index (starting from 1 for numbers >=2; center is \( n=0 \))
- \( k \) is the index within the ring: \( 0 \leq k < 6n \)
- The connections between \( (n, k) \) and \( (n-1, \cdot) \) are as follows:

For ring \( n \), position \( k \):
- The corresponding position in ring \( n-1 \) is:
    \[
    k' = k - \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor
    \]
- Similarly for ring \( n+1 \), the corresponding position is:
    \[
    k'' = k + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor
    \]

#### **Let's calculate \( k \) for 2026:**

- Ring 26, \( k = 74 \) (since the first in ring is 1952, so \( 2026-1952 = 74 \))
- So position 74 in ring 26.

Now,
- \( n = 26 \)
- \( k = 74 \)
- \( \left\lfloor 74/26 \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( k - \left\lfloor k/n \right\rfloor = 74 - 2 = 72 \)
- The **two neighbors in previous ring** (\( n-1 = 25 \)) are at positions 72 and 73 in ring 25.

Each ring \( n \) starts at:
\[
S(n) = 1 + 3(n-1)n
\]

So for ring 25:
- Starts at \( 1 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 1 + 1800 = 1801 \)
  
So numbers at positions 72 and 73:
- \( 1801 + 72 = 1873 \)
- \( 1801 + 73 = 1874 \)

#### **Two neighbors in next ring (\( n+1 = 27 \))**

- \( k'' = 74 + 2 = 76 \)
- So positions 76 and 77 in ring 27.

Ring 27 starts at:
\[
1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107
\]

So numbers are:
- \( 2107 + 76 = 2183 \)
- \( 2107 + 77 = 2184 \)

### **Full List of Neighbors**

- Previous/next in same ring:  
    \( 2025, 2027 \)
- 2 in previous ring:  
    \( 1873, 1874 \)
- 2 in next ring:  
    \( 2183, 2184 \)

### **Sum**

Add these up:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 1873 + 1874 + 2183 + 2184 = ?
\]

Let's do it step by step:

- \( 2025 + 2027 = 4052 \)
- \( 1873 + 1874 = 3747 \)
- \( 2183 + 2184 = 4367 \)

Now sum:
\[
4052 + 3747 = 7799 \\
7799 + 4367 = 12166
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{12166}
\]

**The sum of the six neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{12166}\).**
