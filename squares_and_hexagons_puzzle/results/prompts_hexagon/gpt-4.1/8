Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral**

On a hexagonal grid, every cell (except the center) has 6 neighbors. The numbers spiral out from the center (which is 1). From the example:

```
... 14  4  3 10 ...
.. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
... 16  6  7  8 ...
```
So numbers spiral outwards.

**Step 2: Sequence in the Spiral**

From the pattern, we can see:

- The first ring (center) is: 1
- The second ring goes: 2 3 4 5 6 7 (so second "layer" has 6 numbers, starts at 2)
- The third ring: 8-19 (should be 12 numbers since each ring increases by 6 more than previous, i.e., 6, 12, ...)

Let’s generalize:
- k-th hex ring contains \(6(k-1)\) numbers
- First number in k-th ring: \(1 + 6 \cdot (0 + 1 + ... + (k-2)) + 1\)
- The sum \(0 + 1 + ... + (k-2) = \frac{(k-2)(k-1)}{2}\)
- So first number in k-th ring:
  \[
  1 + 6 \cdot \frac{(k-2)(k-1)}{2} + 1 = 2 + 3(k-2)(k-1)
  \]

But let's be more precise by working out the starting number for each ring.

**Step 3: Find which ring 2026 is in**

Tally up the number of cells in each ring up to k:

- Ring 1: 1 cell (1)
- Ring 2: 6 cells (2-7)
- Ring 3: 12 (8-19)
- Ring 4: 18 (20-37)
- Ring 5: 24 (38-61)
- Ring k: \(6(k-1)\)

Cumulative total up to ring \(k\): \(1 + 6 \cdot (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2}\)

So,
\[
N_k = 1 + 3(k-1)k
\]
where \(N_k\) is **the greatest value in the k-th ring**.

Set \(N_k \geq 2026\):

\[
1 + 3(k-1)k \geq 2026 \\
3(k-1)k \geq 2025 \\
(k-1)k \geq 675 \\
\]
Now \(k^2 - k - 675 \geq 0\),

Solve quadratic:
\[
k = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675}}{2}
= \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2}
= \frac{1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]
\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 52\)

So \(k \approx (1+52)/2 = 26.5\), so ring **k=27**.

Now, check:

- \(k=26: (26-1)*26 = 25*26=650\), \(N_{26} = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 3*650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951\)
- \(k=27: (27-1)*27 = 26*27=702\), \(N_{27} = 1 + 3*26*27 = 1 + 3*702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107\)

So ring 27 contains numbers from \(N_{26}+1 = 1952\) up to \(N_{27}=2107\).

**Step 4: Position of 2026 in ring 27**

First number: 1952, total numbers: \(6*(27-1) = 156\)

**Which side and position?**

Walk around the ring: sides are six, each leg is length 26.

Positions on sides:
- 1952 (start of ring 27, first after 1951)
- Next 26 numbers: first side (1952–1977)
- Next 26: second side (1978–2003)
- Next 26: third side (2004–2029)
- Next 26: fourth side (2030–2055)
- Next 26: fifth side (2056–2081)
- Next 26: sixth side (2082-2107)

So:

- 1952–1977: side 1
- 1978–2003: side 2
- 2004–2029: side 3
- 2030–2055: side 4
- 2056–2081: side 5
- 2082–2107: side 6

2026 is on **side 3: 2004–2029**.

What is its offset on that side?

2004 (first of side 3)
So, 2026 - 2004 = 22
So 2026 is the 23rd entry on side 3 (since we start at 0: 0-based index: 22, 1-based: 23rd).

**Step 5: Finding Neighbors’ Numbers**

On this spiral, each number has 6 neighbors:

- Two on the same ring (previous and next on ring)
- Two on the outer ring (adjacent positions)
- Two on the inner ring (adjacent positions), unless you're next to start/end of a side

Let's call the **current ring** as R (ring 27), **outer ring** (R+1, which is 28), **inner ring** (R-1, 26).

Within ring R, the numbers run from 1952 to 2107.

Let’s define:
- \(n\): position along side (from 0 to 25, as there are 26 per side)
- Each ring starts as above.

For ring R (27):

- Side 1: 1952–1977
- Side 2: 1978–2003
- Side 3: 2004–2029
- Side 4: 2030–2055
- Side 5: 2056–2081
- Side 6: 2082–2107

2026 is at side 3, position 2026–2004=22 (zero-based index).

So, in ring R:
- Previous: 2025
- Next: 2027

**Mapping to inner and outer rings**

In the hex spiral, for a given number not at a corner, the correspondence is:
- Each number in ring R between corners is adjacent to:
    - The same index in the inner ring (R-1)
    - The previous index in the inner ring (potentially the corner before)
    - The same index in the outer ring (R+1)
    - The next index in the outer ring

But corners need special handling.

Our position is not at a corner.

- Let's index from 0 to 25 on side 3 (0-based), 2026 is at index 22.

Side 3's starting value in ring 27: 2004

Now, let's list the starting values for ring 26:

- Ring 26: starts at 1952 (end at 1951), but we have:

196: Ring 26 runs from 1796 to 1951 (ring 25: 1651 to 1795).

We need to find the corresponding starting value for side 3 in ring 26.

Total numbers in ring 26: \(6 \times 25 = 150\)
Per side: 25 numbers.

Ring 26 runs: 1952–1951, but that's technical confusion; actually, ring 26: numbers between 1796 ((1951–150 + 1) = 1951–149 = 1802) and 1951 (since ring 25 ends at 1795). Let's double-check.

For ring k, 
\[
\text{First in ring k:} 1+3(k-2)(k-1)+1 = 2+3(k-2)(k-1)
\]
\[
\text{or use cumulative:} N_{k-1}+1
N_k = 1 + 3(k-1)k
N_{k-1} = 1 + 3(k-2)(k-1)
N_{k-1}+1 = 3(k-2)(k-1)+2
\]

So for k=27:
\(N_{26} = 1 + 3*25*26 = 1 + 1950 = 1951\)
So ring 27: 1952–2107

Ring 26: 1796–1951

Ring 25: 1651–1795

Ring 28: (N27+1): 2108–2295

So ring 27 side 3: starts at
- Side 1: 1952
- Side 2: 1978
- Side 3: 2004

Each side length is 26.

In ring 26: sides of 25.

Sides:
- Side 1: 1796–1820 (25 numbers)
- Side 2: 1821–1845
- Side 3: 1846–1870
- Side 4: 1871–1895
- Side 5: 1896–1920
- Side 6: 1921–1951

Similarly, mapping **index 22 of side 3 in ring 27** to ring 26: For side 3, index 22 (so 22 positions from start), corresponding inner ring would (on side 3) be index 21 or 22 for the two inner neighbors.

Let's be more precise.
- In side 3, ring 27, position 22: 2004 + 22 = 2026
- To find the corresponding spot in the inner ring, ring 26:

Each position on side 3 of ring 27 maps to:
- 1 inner neighbor on side 3 of ring 26, same index (i = 22), value: 1846 + 22 = 1868
- 1 inner neighbor on side 3 of ring 26, previous index (i = 21), value: 1846 + 21 = 1867

- 1 outer neighbor on side 3 of ring 28, same index (i = 22), ring 28 side 3 starts at 2152 (since ring 28: starts at 2108, sides are length 27; so side 1: 2108; side 2: 2108+27=2135; side 3: 2135+27=2162; wait, that's 2162. Let's formalize:

Ring 28: 2108–2295, 6 sides of 27 numbers each.
- Side 1: 2108–2134 (27 numbers)
- Side 2: 2135–2161
- Side 3: 2162–2188

So, side 3 starts at 2162

Therefore:

- In ring 27, side 3, index 22: 2004+22=2026
- Outer neighbor on side 3, ring 28, index 22: 2162+22=2184
- Outer neighbor, index 23: 2162+23=2185

Next, the "next" neighbor in ring 27 is 2027, previous is 2025.

Thus, the 6 neighbors are:

1. 2025 (ring 27, same side, previous index)
2. 2027 (ring 27, same side, next index)
3. 1867 (ring 26, same side, previous index)
4. 1868 (ring 26, same side, same index)
5. 2184 (ring 28, same side, same index)
6. 2185 (ring 28, same side, next index)

**Step 6: Sum**

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1867 + 1868 + 2184 + 2185
\]
Let’s add:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

1867 + 1868 = 3735

2184 + 2185 = 4369

Now sum:

4052 + 3735 = 7787

7787 + 4369 = 12156

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12156}
\]

**The sum of all 6 neighbors of the number 2026 in the hexagonal spiral is \(\boxed{12156}\).**
