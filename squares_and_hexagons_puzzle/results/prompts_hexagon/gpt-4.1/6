Let's break down the problem methodically:

### 1. **Understanding the Hexagonal Spiral**

We are told that the natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a hexagonal grid. The grid's provided local layout is:

```
   14  4  3 10
 15  5  1  2  9
   16  6  7  8
```

Focus on **1** — it's the center. Numbers increase outwards in a spiral, each ring forming a regular hexagon.

### 2. **The spiral's arithmetic structure**

The numbers are laid **in rings around the center**. Each ring is a hexagon, encompassing the previous.

#### **Ring n:**
- Center is ring 0, which is just 1 (the number).
- Each additional ring adds 6 more entries than the previous.

- **Ring 0:** 1
- **Ring 1:** 2...7 = 6 numbers (total up to 7)
- **Ring 2:** 8...19 = 12 numbers (total up to 19)
- **Ring 3:** 20...37 = 18 numbers (total up to 37)
- etc.

Let's formalize:

- Number of numbers in ring \( r \) (excluding the center): \( 6r \)
- The **last number** in ring \( r \) is:  
  \( 1 + 6(1 + 2 + \dots + r) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{r(r+1)}{2} \)
  \( = 1 + 3r(r+1) \)

So, the largest number in ring \( r \) = \( 3r(r+1) + 1 \).

Let's check for ring 1: \( r = 1 \): \( 3 \times 2 + 1 = 7 \) -- matches "up to 7".
Ring 2: \( 3 \times 2 \times 3 + 1 = 3 \times 6 + 1 = 19 \) -- matches.

### 3. **Find which ring 2026 is in**

We solve: \( 3r(r+1) + 1 \geq 2026 \)

So \( 3r^2 + 3r + 1 \geq 2026 \)
\( 3r^2 + 3r \geq 2025 \)
\( r^2 + r \geq 675 \)
Solve \( r^2 + r - 675 = 0 \):

\( r = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 675}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2} \)

\(\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96\). So

\( r \approx \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} \approx \frac{50.96}{2} = 25.48 \)

So, the **25th ring** ends at

\( 3 \times 25 \times 26 + 1 = 3 \times 650 + 1 = 1951 \)
1951 < 2026

26th ring:
\( 3 \times 26 \times 27 + 1 = 3 \times 702 + 1 = 2107 \)
2026 ≤ 2107

So, **ring 26**.

The **first number** in ring 26 is the number right after ring 25's end:

- Last number of ring \( r - 1 \): \( 3(r-1)r + 1 \)

Ring 25: last is 1951; so first of ring 26 is **1952**.
- There are \( 6 \times 26 = 156 \) numbers in ring 26.
- Let's check: 1952 + 155 = 2107 ([[computed above|yes]]).

Find **position** in the ring:
\( 2026 - 1952 = 74 \implies \) the 75th (since counting starts at 1) number on the 26th ring.

So, **2026 is the 75th position in ring 26**.

### 4. **Neighborhood structure**

In a regular hex ring, each position has two neighbors in the same ring (previous, next), two in previous ring, two in next ring.

The spiral, for each ring:
- Each ring has 6 straight segments (hexagon sides), each of \( r \) positions.

The k-th position of ring \( r \) is adjacent to:
- previous and next in ring \( r \) (cyclic)
- "corresponding positions" in rings \( r-1 \) and \( r+1 \), depending on side.

Our position is at \( k = 75 \) in ring \( 26 \), with positions numbered \( 0 \) to \( 155 \) in the ring (since 156 positions). So, \( k = 74 \).

Let's break the ring into sides:
- Side 1: positions 0 to 25
- Side 2: 26 to 51
- Side 3: 52 to 77
- Side 4: 78 to 103
- Side 5: 104 to 129
- Side 6: 130 to 155

Positions:
- 0: ring starting corner (for each side)
- Each side is 26 positions (since ring 26).

So, **75** is between 52 and 77 (Side 3).
- On side 3, position in side: \( 75 - 52 = 23 \), so it's the 24th position on side 3 (since positions 0–25 per side).

Let us formalize the structure of the numbers as "corner-based".

Let us denote:
- For ring \( r \), the starting number is \( S = 3(r-1)r + 2 \).
- For ring \( r \), the positions go from \( 0 \) to \( 6r - 1 \) (total \( 6r \)).
- For position \( k \), the number is \( S + k \).

So for **ring 26**:
- \( S = 3 \times 25 \times 26 + 2 = 3 \times 650 + 2 = 1952 \)
- So at position \( k = 74 \), the number is \( 1952 + 74 = 2026 \) (verifies our count).

### 5. **The neighbor positions**

Each number has 6 neighbors:

- Two in same ring: at positions \( k-1 \) and \( k+1 \) (modulo \( 156 \)).
- Two in previous ring (ring 25)
- Two in next ring (ring 27)

#### **Same ring**
- \( k-1 = 73 \)
- \( k+1 = 75 \)

So, in ring 26,
- \( 1952 + 73 = 2025 \)
- \( 1952 + 75 = 2027 \)

#### **In previous ring (ring 25, positions!)**

**Find the corresponding positions in ring 25**
- Ring 25: has \( 6 \times 25 = 150 \) positions (positions 0 to 149), numbers \( 3 \times 24 \times 25 + 2 = 1802 \), so numbers from \( 1802 \) to \( 1951 \).

For ring \( r \), positions are assigned side-by-side along each of the 6 sides.

For position \( k \) in ring \( r \), which is at position on side \( s \), offset \( o \):

- Side \( s = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{r} \right\rfloor \),  
- Offset on side: \( o = k \bmod r \),
    - (Each side has \( r \) positions, running 0 to \( r-1 \).)

Now, the corresponding positions in previous ring (ring 25):
- For each position in ring \( r \), its two adjacent previous ring numbers are on sides \( s \) and \( s + 1 \) (modulo 6), at offsets \( o \) and \( o - 1 \) (respectively, with cyclic wrap).
  - `In the source ring, position = (side) * r + offset`
  - In ring \( r-1 \):  
      - position1: side \( s \), offset \( o \) ⇒ \( s \times (r-1) + o \)
      - position2: side \( (s+1 \mod 6) \), offset \( o-1 \) (if \( o > 0 \)), otherwise offset 24 (if wrapping, as in ring 25, offset must be 24 when \( o=0 \))

Let's compute step-by-step:

- \( k = 74 \), \( r = 26 \)
- \( s = \lfloor 74 / 26 \rfloor = 2 \)   (since 26 × 2 = 52, 52 ≤ 74 < 78)
- \( o = 74 \bmod 26 = 22 \)  (since 3 × 26 = 78, so 74 - 52 = 22)

So,
- Side 2 (counting from 0), offset 22 on that side (offsets run 0..25).

#### **Ring 25:**
Positions per side: 25 (offsets 0..24).

First corresponding neighbor:
- side \( s = 2 \), offset \( o = 22 \)
- position: \( 2 \times 25 + 22 = 50 + 22 = 72 \)
- Number: starting number \( S_{25} = 1802 \), so \( 1802 + 72 = 1874 \)

Second corresponding neighbor:
- side \( s+1 = 3 \)
- offset \( o-1 = 21 \)
- position: \( 3 \times 25 + 21 = 75 + 21 = 96 \)
- Number: \( 1802 + 96 = 1898 \)

#### **In next ring (ring 27, positions!)**

Ring 27: \( 6 \times 27 = 162 \) positions, positions 0..161
Starting number: \( 3 \times 26 \times 27 + 2 = 3 \times 702 + 2 = 2108 \), numbers \( 2108 \) to \( 2108 + 161 = 2269 \).

The corresponding two positions in next ring are as above:
- For position \( k \) in ring \( r \), the corresponding positions in ring \( r+1 \) are at:
    - side \( s \), offset \( o \)
    - side \( s \), offset \( o+1 \)

So:
- side \( s = 2 \), offset \( o = 22 \)
- position1: \( 2 \times 27 + 22 = 54 + 22 = 76 \)
- offset \( o+1 = 23 \), position2: \( 2 \times 27 + 23 = 77 \)

So, numbers:
- 2108 + 76 = 2184
- 2108 + 77 = 2185

### 6. **Summary: Find all 6 neighbor numbers**

- Same ring: \( 2025, 2027 \)
- Previous ring: \( 1874, 1898 \)
- Next ring: \( 2184, 2185 \)

### 7. **Calculate the sum**

\[
\begin{align*}
2025 + 2027 = 4052 \\
1874 + 1898 = 3772 \\
2184 + 2185 = 4369 \\
\text{Total} = 4052 + 3772 + 4369 = \boxed{12193}
\end{align*}
\]

---

## **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{12193}
\]

That is, the sum of all 6 neighbors of number 2026 in the hex spiral is **12193**.
