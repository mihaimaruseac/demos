Let's analyze the problem step by step. The key is to understand the layout of the **hexagonal spiral** and how numbers are assigned to positions, especially how to determine the neighbors of a given number.

---

## 1. **Understanding the layout**

Let's write out the given part for clarity, aligning as a hex grid:

```
Row -2:     ... 14  4  3 10 ...
Row -1:    .. 15  5  1  2  9 ...
Row  0:     ... 16  6  7  8 ...
```

Notice:  
- **1** is at the center.
- The numbers spiral outward in a hexagonal pattern.

In a **hexagonal spiral**, each "shell" around the center adds 6 more numbers than the previous shell did.
- Shell 0 (center): \(1\)
- Shell 1: \(2\) to \(7\) (6 numbers)
- Shell 2: \(8\) to \(19\) (12 numbers)
- Shell 3: \(20\) to \(37\) (18 numbers)
- and so on.

The total number of numbers up to and including shell \(k\) is:
\[
1 + 6 (1 + 2 + \cdots + k)
= 1 + 6 \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)
= 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]

---

## 2. **Shell placement**

Given \(2026\), find which shell it is in:

Set:
\[
n = 1 + 3k(k+1)
\]
We want: \( n < 2026 \leq n' \), where \( n \) is for shell \( (k-1) \) and \( n' \) is for shell \( k \).

Let's solve for \( k \):

\[
1 + 3k(k+1) \geq 2026 \implies 3k^2 + 3k + 1 - 2026 \geq 0
\]
\[
3k^2 + 3k - 2025 \geq 0
\]

Solve quadratic:
\[
k^2 + k - 675 \geq 0
\]
Quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{2701} \approx 51.96
\]
So,
\[
k \approx \frac{-1 + 51.96}{2} \approx 25.48
\]

So, shell \(k = 25\) contains:

Last number in shell 24:
\[
1 + 3 \times 24 \times 25 = 1 + 3 \times 600 = 1 + 1800 = 1801
\]
Thus, shell 25 starts at 1802 and ends at:
\[
1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1 + 3 \times 650 = 1 + 1950 = 1951
\]
WAIT: \(3 \times 25 \times 26 = 3 \times 650 = 1950\) so last is \(1 + 1950 = 1951\)

But that would mean shell 25 only goes up to **1951**; but **2026** is larger. Let's check.

Calculate until we pass 2026:

- Shell \(k\) ends at \(1 + 3k(k+1)\).

So,
- For \(k=25\): \(1 + 3 \times 25 \times 26 = 1951\)
- For \(k=26\): \(1 + 3 \times 26 \times 27 = 1 + 3 \times 702 = 1 + 2106 = 2107\)

So:
- Shell 25: 1802 to 1951
- Shell 26: 1952 to 2107

**2026 is in shell 26!**

Start of shell 26: **1952**
End of shell 26: **2107**
Number of cells in shell 26: \(6 \times 26 = 156\)

---

## 3. **Position of 2026 in shell 26**

\(2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75\): It is the 75th cell in shell 26.

In the hex spiral, each shell is made of 6 edges, each with \(k\) cells.

- Each side: 26 numbers (since \(k=26\)), but the first cell on each side is the *corner*, shared with last cell of previous side.

To **map neighbors**, let's enumerate where \(2026\) is:

- \#1: Starting corner (at \(1952\))
- \#2–26: First edge
- \#27: first corner
- \#28–52: second edge, etc.

**To which edge and position does 75 correspond?**
- First cell of shell (corner): 1952
- Edge 1: 1952–1977 (\(1952, 1953, \ldots, 1977\)) (\(1\) corner + \(25\) more = 26 total)
- Corner at \(1977\) (\#26 in shell), next edge starts at 1978 (\#27)
- Edge 2: 1978–2003 (\(1978, ..., 2003\)) (\(1978\) is corner, then edge to \(2003\), 1978–2003 inclusive = 26)
- Next corner at \(2003\) (\#52 in shell), next edge at 2004 (\#53)
- Edge 3: 2004–2029 (\(2004, ..., 2029\)), corner at \(2029\) (\#78 in shell)

So **2026** is on the **third edge (third side), seven places before the corner (\#78)**.

Counting:  
- 1st edge: \#1–26 (\(1952–1977\))
- 2nd edge: \#27–52 (\(1978–2003\))
- 3rd edge: \#53–78 (\(2004–2029\))

**2026 is the \((2026 - 2003) = 23\)rd step along the third edge (from its starting corner).**

---

## 4. **Finding its six neighbors**

Each cell in the hex grid has 6 neighbors:

- One _inwards_ (to shell 25)
- One _forwards_ ("next" in shell 26)
- One _backwards_ ("previous" in shell 26)
- Two in the _inner shell_ (corners to inward neighbor)
- Two in the _outer shell_ (in corners with outward neighbor)

Because this spiral is regular, for non-corner cells (not at a vertex), the pattern is:

For cell \( C \) at position \(n\) steps along an edge of shell \(k\),  
- The number on inner shell:  
   - shell \((k-1)\), on same edge, position \(n\)
- The next and previous cells in shell \(k\): adjacent in the spiral sequence (2025 and 2027)
- The two inner-shell diagonal neighbors: shell \(k-1\), positions \(n-1\) and \(n\) on that edge
- The two outer-shell diagonal neighbors: shell \(k+1\), positions \(n\) and \(n-1\) on that edge

Let's formalize the neighbor-finding.

For cell at shell \(k\), edge \(e\) (0 to 5), offset \(n\) (from 0 to \(k-1\)):  
- Its index in shell: \(i = e \cdot k + n + 1\) (1-based in shell, as discussed above)
- Its absolute number:  
\[
N = 1 + 3k(k-1) + i
\]
Where \(i = e \cdot k + n + 1\).

But let's just use our previously found positions for ease.

**2026 is at:**
- \(k=26\)
- 3rd edge (\(e=2\))
- On that edge, position \(n = 2026 - 2003 - 1 = 22\) (so 0-based)

So its **6 neighbors** are:

1. **Inner shell, same edge, same offset:**  
   - Shell 25, edge 2, offset 22  
   - Its number: the starting number for shell 25, edge 2, offset 22

2. **Inner shell, same edge, offset 21** (previous along edge)  
3. **Same shell, previous:** \(2025\)
4. **Same shell, next:** \(2027\)
5. **Outer shell, same edge, offset 22**
6. **Outer shell, same edge, offset 23**

---

### Let's find starting numbers for shells

**Shell 25:**
- Starts at 1802
- Each edge has 25 numbers (offset 0 to 24)
- Edges: 0 to 5
- For edge 2, offset 22:  
\[
\text{Start of shell} = 1802 \\
\text{Start of edge 0: } 1802 \\
\text{Start of edge 1: } 1802 + 25 = 1827 \\
\text{Start of edge 2: } 1802 + 2 \times 25 = 1852 \\
\]

So, shell 25, edge 2, offset 22:  
\(1852 + 22 = 1874\)

**Shell 25, edge 2, offset 21:**  
\(1852 + 21 = 1873\)

**Same shell (26):**
- Previous: \(2025\)
- Next: \(2027\)

**Outer shell (27):**
- Shell 27 starts at: \(1 + 3 \times 27 \times 28 = 1 + 3 \times 756 = 1 + 2268 = 2269\)
- Each edge: 27 numbers (\(k=27\)), offsets 0 to 26

- **Start of edge 0:** 2269
- **Edge 2:** \(2269 + 2 \times 27 = 2269 + 54 = 2323\)
- Offset 22: \(2323 + 22 = 2345\)
- Offset 23: \(2323 + 23 = 2346\)

---

## 5. **Neighbors of 2026**

Summarize:
1. **Inner shell (25), edge 2, offset 22:** **1874**
2. **Inner shell (25), edge 2, offset 21:** **1873**
3. **2025**
4. **2027**
5. **Outer shell (27), edge 2, offset 22:** **2345**
6. **Outer shell (27), edge 2, offset 23:** **2346**

---

### **Sum of the six neighbors:**

\[
1873 + 1874 + 2025 + 2027 + 2345 + 2346
\]

Let’s compute:

- \(1873 + 1874 = 3747\)
- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(2345 + 2346 = 4691\)

Sum:
\[
3747 + 4052 = 7799 \\
7799 + 4691 = 12490 \\
\]

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{12490}
\]

---

### **The sum of all 6 neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{12490}\).**
