Let the numbers be arranged in a spiral in a hexagonal grid, starting with 1 in the center.
The numbers are arranged as follows:
... 14 4 3 10 ...
.. 15 5 1 2 9 ...
... 16 6 7 8 ...
We can see that the spiral consists of hexagonal layers.
The first layer is just 1.
The second layer has 6 numbers (2 to 7).
The third layer has 12 numbers (8 to 19).
The fourth layer has 18 numbers (20 to 37).
In general, the $n$-th layer has $6(n-1)$ numbers for $n > 1$.
The sum of the number of elements up to the $n$-th layer is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^n 6(i-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = 1 + 6 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
Let the layer in which 2026 is located be $n$. Then $3n^2 - 3n + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \ge 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \ge 0$
We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $n^2 - n - 675 \ge 0$.
Let $n^2 - n - 675 = 0$. Then $n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}$.
Since $n$ must be positive, we have $n = \frac{1 + \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 26.48$.
So we can take $n = 27$.
Then the number of elements up to the 26th layer is $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
The 27th layer starts at 1952.
Let $k = 2026 - 1952 = 74$. Then 2026 is the 74th number in the 27th layer.
The 27th layer has $6(26) = 156$ numbers.
Since $74 < 156$, 2026 is in the 27th layer.

Let $N$ be the number 2026.
The sum of its 6 neighbors is $6N$ if the neighbors are uniformly distributed around $N$.
In our case, we consider the neighbors of 1. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27 = 6(1) + 21$.
The neighbors of 2 are 1, 3, 8, 9, 5, 4. The sum is $1+3+8+9+5+4 = 30 = 6(2) + 18$.
The neighbors of 3 are 10, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11. The sum is $10+2+4+6+7+11 = 40 = 6(3) + 22$.

Let the coordinates of 1 be (0, 0). Then we can express the location of each number using two coordinates. The number 2026 is close to the boundary of the layer.

The neighbors of 2026 will be 2026-x and 2026+y. The sum of the neighbors is $6(2026) = 12156$.
However, the numbers in a spiral are not uniformly distributed.

The average value of a layer will be approximately the middle value of the layer.
The value of the first number in layer $n$ is $3(n-1)^2 - 3(n-1) + 2$.
The last number in layer $n$ is $3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
The middle number is $\frac{3(n-1)^2 - 3(n-1) + 2 + 3n^2 - 3n + 1}{2} = \frac{6n^2 - 12n + 8}{2} = 3n^2 - 6n + 4$.
When $n=27$, we have $3(27^2) - 6(27) + 4 = 2187 - 162 + 4 = 2029$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
