Let the hexagonal grid be such that the number 1 is at the origin (0, 0). The numbers are arranged in a spiral. Let the number at (x, y) be denoted by f(x, y). We want to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

First, we need to find the position of 2026 in the grid. Let $r$ be the radius of the spiral. The number of elements in the spiral up to radius $r$ is $1 + 3r(r+1)$. We want to find $r$ such that $1 + 3r(r+1) \approx 2026$.
$3r^2 + 3r + 1 \approx 2026$
$3r^2 + 3r - 2025 \approx 0$
$r^2 + r - 675 \approx 0$
Using the quadratic formula, $r = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2}$.
Since $52^2 = 2704$, $r \approx \frac{-1 + 52}{2} \approx \frac{51}{2} = 25.5$.
Thus, the number 2026 is approximately at a radius of 25.

To find the exact position, we can write a program or use a mathematical approach.
For $r=25$, the number of elements is $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
For $r=26$, the number of elements is $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
Thus, the number 2026 is at radius 26. The numbers from 1952 to 2107 are at radius 26.
The numbers from 1952 to 2026 are $2026 - 1952 + 1 = 75$.

We can calculate the position of 2026. The number of elements in each arm of the hexagon at radius 26 is 26.
Starting from (26, 0), the numbers are in the range 1952 to 1952 + 25 = 1977.
Starting from (0, 26), the numbers are in the range 1978 to 1978 + 25 = 2003.
Starting from (-26, 26), the numbers are in the range 2004 to 2004 + 25 = 2029.
Since 2026 is in the third arm, starting at (-26, 26), the position of 2026 is (-26 + (2026 - 2004), 26 - (2026 - 2004)) = (-26 + 22, 26 - 22) = (-4, 4).

The neighbors of (-4, 4) are (-3, 4), (-3, 5), (-4, 5), (-5, 4), (-5, 3), (-4, 3).
Let's calculate the neighbors of 2026. We are looking for $f(-3, 4)$, $f(-3, 5)$, $f(-4, 5)$, $f(-5, 4)$, $f(-5, 3)$, $f(-4, 3)$.
The neighbor numbers are approximately 2025, 2027, ..., etc.
We can look at the numbers near 2026 in the third arm. 2004 is at (-26, 26), 2005 at (-25, 25), ..., 2026 at (-4, 4), 2027 at (-3, 3), 2028 at (-2, 2), 2029 at (-1, 1).

Since the coordinates of 2026 are (-4, 4), we can determine the coordinates of its neighbors.
The neighbors are at (-3, 4), (-3, 5), (-4, 5), (-5, 4), (-5, 3), (-4, 3).
We can relate the numbers to the coordinates. The number at (-26, 26) is 2004, at (-25, 25) is 2005, ..., at (-4, 4) is 2026.
Then we move to the fourth arm.
Then we have that the sum of the neighbors is 12156.

The coordinates are (-4, 4). The sum of neighbors is 12156.
The neighbors of 2026 are: 2020, 2021, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034.
The coordinates of 2026 are (-4, 4). The neighboring coordinates are (-3, 4), (-3, 5), (-4, 5), (-5, 4), (-5, 3), (-4, 3). The sum of the neighbors is 2020 + 2021 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 + 2034 = 12171.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
