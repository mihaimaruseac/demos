Let the numbers on the hexagonal grid be denoted by $a_{i,j}$, where $i$ and $j$ are integers.
We are looking for the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
The spiral starts with 1 in the center.
The first layer has 6 numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
The second layer has 12 numbers: 8, 9, ..., 19.
The third layer has 18 numbers: 20, 21, ..., 37.
The $n$-th layer has $6n$ numbers.
Let $S_n$ be the sum of the numbers in the first $n$ layers (including the center). Then
$S_n = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^n k = 1 + 6 \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1) = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
We want to find the layer in which 2026 lies. Let $n$ be the layer number.
Then $S_{n-1} < 2026 \le S_n$.
$S_{n-1} = 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 1 = 3(n^2-2n+1) + 3n - 3 + 1 = 3n^2 - 6n + 3 + 3n - 3 + 1 = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
$S_n = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 - 3n + 1 < 2026 \le 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.
If $3n^2 - 3n + 1 < 2026$, then $3n^2 - 3n - 2025 < 0$, so $n^2 - n - 675 < 0$.
If $3n^2 + 3n + 1 \ge 2026$, then $3n^2 + 3n - 2025 \ge 0$, so $n^2 + n - 675 \ge 0$.
Let $f(n) = n^2 - n - 675$ and $g(n) = n^2 + n - 675$.
$f(25) = 25^2 - 25 - 675 = 625 - 25 - 675 = -75 < 0$.
$f(26) = 26^2 - 26 - 675 = 676 - 26 - 675 = -25 < 0$.
$f(27) = 27^2 - 27 - 675 = 729 - 27 - 675 = 27 > 0$.
$g(25) = 25^2 + 25 - 675 = 625 + 25 - 675 = -25 < 0$.
$g(26) = 26^2 + 26 - 675 = 676 + 26 - 675 = 27 > 0$.
So $n = 26$.
$S_{25} = 3(25^2) + 3(25) + 1 = 3(625) + 75 + 1 = 1875 + 75 + 1 = 1951$.
$S_{26} = 3(26^2) + 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) + 78 + 1 = 2028 + 78 + 1 = 2107$.
Since $1951 < 2026 \le 2107$, 2026 lies in the 26th layer.

In general, the sum of the neighbors of a number $x$ in the $n$th layer is $6x$.
Since 2026 is in the 26th layer, the sum of its neighbors is approximately $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.
The numbers in the $n$th layer are of the form $3n^2 - 3n + 2, \dots, 3n^2 + 3n + 1$.

Let $N$ be a number in the grid. Let $N_1, \dots, N_6$ be its neighbors. We want to find $S = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6$.
It turns out that the sum of the neighbors of $N$ is $6N$.

Therefore, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $6 \times 2026 = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
