Let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the neighbors of the number $n$ in the hexagonal grid.
We want to find $S(2026)$.
The numbers in the spiral are written in increasing order, starting with 1 in the center. The spiral moves outward.
Let $a_n$ be the $n$-th layer of the spiral, starting from the center as layer 0. The number of elements in layer $n$ is $6n$ for $n \geq 1$. The first layer has 6 elements, the second layer has 12 elements, the third layer has 18 elements, and so on.
The largest number in layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{k=1}^n 6k = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=1}^n k = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 3n(n+1)$.
Let $N$ be the layer of the number 2026. Then $1 + 3N(N+1) \geq 2026$.
We have $3N(N+1) \geq 2025$, so $N(N+1) \geq 675$.
Since $25 \cdot 26 = 650$ and $26 \cdot 27 = 702$, we can guess that $N=25$.
The largest number in layer 25 is $1 + 3(25)(26) = 1 + 3(650) = 1 + 1950 = 1951$.
The number 2026 is in layer 26. The largest number in layer 26 is $1 + 3(26)(27) = 1 + 3(702) = 1 + 2106 = 2107$.
The first number in layer 26 is $1952 = 1951+1$.
The number of elements in layer 26 is $6 \cdot 26 = 156$.
We have $2026 = 1951 + x$, so $x = 2026 - 1951 = 75$.
The number 2026 is the 75-th number in the layer 26.

Now, let us consider the neighbors of 2026.
The average of the neighbors of any number $n$ is approximately $n$.
Since there are 6 neighbors, we can expect the sum to be approximately $6n$.
If the number is in the center, the sum of neighbors is 6.
For any number in the hexagonal grid, the sum of the neighbors is approximately $6n$.

Since 2026 is in layer 26, we can assume that the neighbors are also close to 2026.
We can approximate the sum of the neighbors as $6 \cdot 2026 = 12156$.

Let $n$ be a number in the spiral. Then $S(n) = 6n$. However, this is not true.
The numbers in the spiral are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...
1 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. $S(1) = 27$.
2 has neighbors 1, 3, 10, 9, 8, 6. $S(2) = 37$.
3 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 14, 15, 10. $S(3) = 46$.

The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$.
Consider the number 2026. $S(2026) = 6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
