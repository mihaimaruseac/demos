Let the hexagonal spiral be denoted by $a(n)$, where $a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 4, a(5) = 5, a(6) = 6, a(7) = 7, \dots$.
The $n$-th hexagon has $6(n-1)$ numbers. The first hexagon has $1$ number, the second has $6$, the third has $12$, the fourth has $18$, etc.
The number of elements in the first $n$ hexagons is $1 + 6(1+2+3+\dots+(n-1)) = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 3n(n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$.

Let's find the hexagon which contains the number 2026. We want to find $n$ such that $3n^2 - 3n + 1 \ge 2026$.
$3n^2 - 3n - 2025 \ge 0$
$n^2 - n - 675 \ge 0$
We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of $n^2 - n - 675 = 0$:
$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(-675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$
Since $n$ must be positive, we take $n = \frac{1 + 51.97}{2} \approx 26.485$. So, we can try $n=26$ and $n=27$.
If $n=26$, $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
If $n=27$, $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Thus, the number 2026 is in the 27th hexagon.

The sum of the 6 neighbors of a number $x$ is $6x$. However, this only holds for large $x$. In general, we can observe that the sum of the six neighbors of $a(n)$ is $S = a(n-6) + a(n-1) + a(n+1) + a(n+6) + a(n+5) + a(n-5)$.

If we consider the numbers in the hexagonal spiral, we can see that the numbers generally increase in a clockwise direction. Let the six neighbors be $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6$. Then, $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 + n_6 = 6(2026)$.
The sum of the neighbors of $n$ is close to $6n$, but not exactly.

Let $n=2026$. The neighbors are $n-1, n+1, n+5, n-5, n+6, n-6$ if $n$ is a large number.
The sum of the neighbors of 1 is $2+3+4+5+6+7=27 = 6(1)+21$
The sum of the neighbors of 2 is $1+3+5+15+16+4=44$
The sum of the neighbors of 3 is $1+2+4+14+13+10=44$

In the middle of the spiral, the sum of the 6 neighbors of $x$ is $6x$.
For large $x$, we expect the sum to be close to $6x$.

$6(2026) = 12156$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
