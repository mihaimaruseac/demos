Let the hexagonal spiral be denoted by $S$. We are looking for the sum of the 6 neighbors of the number 2026. Let $N(n)$ be the set of 6 neighbors of the number $n$. We want to find the sum of the elements in $N(2026)$, i.e., $\sum_{x \in N(2026)} x$.

The numbers are arranged in a spiral starting with 1 in the center.
We can think of the hexagonal spiral as layers around the central number 1.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 numbers)
Layer 3: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 numbers)
The number of elements in layer $k$ is $6(k-1)$ for $k \ge 2$.
The number of elements in the first $k$ layers is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^k 6(i-1) = 1 + 6 \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = 1 + 6 \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} = 1 + 3k(k-1) = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$.
We want to find the layer that 2026 is in. Let $3k^2 - 3k + 1 = 2026$.
$3k^2 - 3k - 2025 = 0$
$k^2 - k - 675 = 0$
Using the quadratic formula, $k = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(675)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2700}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2701}}{2} \approx \frac{1 \pm 51.97}{2}$.
Since $k > 0$, $k \approx \frac{52.97}{2} \approx 26.485$.
Let $k = 26$. Then $3(26^2) - 3(26) + 1 = 3(676) - 78 + 1 = 2028 - 78 + 1 = 1951$.
Let $k = 27$. Then $3(27^2) - 3(27) + 1 = 3(729) - 81 + 1 = 2187 - 81 + 1 = 2107$.
Thus 2026 is in layer 27. The numbers in layer 27 are 1952 to 2107.
The last number in layer $n$ is $3n^2 - 3n + 1$.
The last number in layer 26 is 1951. The numbers in layer 27 are from 1952 to $1951 + 6(27-1) = 1951 + 6(26) = 1951 + 156 = 2107$.
Let $n$ be a number in layer $k > 1$. Then the neighbors of $n$ are on layers $k-1, k, k, k, k, k+1$.
The sum of the 6 neighbors is $6n$ for $n > 1$. Thus, we want to calculate $\sum_{x \in N(2026)} x$.
For the hexagonal grid, the sum of the neighbors of $n$ is $6n$. However, this holds only if $n$ is not on the boundary of the grid. Since 2026 is in layer 27, it is not near the boundary. Thus the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $6(2026) = 12156$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12156}$
