Alright, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the spiral**
The spiral given is known as an **Ulam clockwise spiral**, starting at 1, moving right, then up, left, down, etc.

Tiles layout:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

This means:
- From 1, go right to 2, go up to 3, go left: 4, 5, etc. Actually, no — let's be precise:

The usual “number spiral” starting at 1 at the origin (0,0), in **clockwise** orientation (right, up, left, down …) works as:
- Step length pattern: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, …
- Direction order: R, U, L, D, R, U, L, D, …

Coordinates:
- Start (0,0) = 1.
- Move R 1: (1,0) = 2.
- Move U 1: (1,1) = 3.
- Move L 2: (-1,1) → (0,1) = 4 at (-1,1)? Wait, check carefully.

Let’s lay out exactly:

Number: coordinate
1: (0,0)
Right 1: 2: (1,0)
Up 1: 3: (1,1)
Left 2 steps:
First step: 4: (0,1)
Second step: 5: (-1,1)
Down 2 steps:
First step: 6: (-1,0)
Second step: 7: (-1,-1)
Right 3 steps:
First step: 8: (0,-1)
Second step: 9: (1,-1)
Third step: 10: (2,-1)
Up 3 steps:
First step: 11: (2,0)
Second step: 12: (2,1)
Third step: 13: (2,2)
Left 4 steps:
14: (1,2)
15: (0,2)
16: (-1,2)
17: (-2,2)
etc.

So the given snippet:
Row y=1:  ( -1,1)=5, (0,1)=4, (1,1)=3
Oops, actually 5 is (-1,1), 4 is (0,1), 3 is (1,1).
Next row y=0: (-1,0)=6, (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2
Next row y=-1: (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9

It looks like the snippet they gave is arranged with axes such that UP is positive y? Actually maybe x increases right, y increases down? Let’s check given:

Their arrangement:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

If we read (col,row) in usual computer screen coords: top-left (x,y) with y downward? Maybe better to think in (x,y) math coords: y upward?

Given: Row1: 5 4 3 → maybe y=1 row: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3.
Row0: 6 1 2 → y=0: x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2.
Row-1: 7 8 9 → y=-1: x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9.

Checking: 1 at (0,0), right:2 at (1,0), up:3 at (1,1), left:4 at (0,1), left:5 at (-1,1), down:6 at (-1,0), down:7 at (-1,-1), right:8 at (0,-1), right:9 at (1,-1).

Matches! So their snippet uses math coords with center (0,0) as 1. So:
Coordinates:  
5→(-1,1), 4→(0,1), 3→(1,1),  
6→(-1,0), 1→(0,0), 2→(1,0),  
7→(-1,-1),8→(0,-1),9→(1,-1).

Yes.

So spiral direction: from 1 right → 2; up→3; left→4→5; down→6→7; right→8→9→10; etc.

---

## **2. Finding coordinates of 2026**
We need rule to find coordinates directly.

We can use the fact that numbers appear on squares of odd side lengths centered at 1:
- Square 1: side 1 (1, numbers 1)
- Square 3: side 3 (numbers 2 to 9)
- Square 5: side 5 (numbers 10 to 25)
- Square 7: side 7 (numbers 26 to 49), etc.

We note:
Let k = ring index (0-based):
Ring k has side length m = 2k+1.
Numbers in ring k: from (2k-1)^2+1 to (2k+1)^2.

Better: Ring r (r=1,2,...) has bottom-right corner number (2r-1)^2? Let's try:

r=1: side 3, num 1..9? Wait: numbers at ring r=0: just {1}.
Ring 1 (k=1): side 3, contains 2 through 9.
Ring 2 (k=2): side 5, contains 10 through 25.
Ring 3 (k=3): side 7, contains 26 through 49.
Yes: First number of ring k: N_start = (2k-1)^2 + 1, k>=1.
Max number of ring k: (2k+1)^2.

Example k=1: N_start = (1)^2+1=2, max = 9.

---

**Find ring for 2026:**
Find k such that:
(2k-1)^2 + 1 <= 2026 <= (2k+1)^2.

Try k=22: (44-1)^2+1 = 1849+1=1850, max=(45)^2=2025 → so 2025 is last of ring k=22.

Check: k=22: (2k-1)=43 square=1849, so ring k starts at 1850, ends at 45^2=2025.
Answer: 2025 is the last number in ring 22 → it is bottom-right corner (k,k) in coords? Actually maybe (k, -k)?

Wait: Ring k: side = 2k+1, lower right corner number = (2k+1)^2.
Here k=22: side=45, last number=2025.

So 2026 is first number of next ring k=23? But  ring index definition consistent? Let's check:

Ring k=0: just number 1 at (0,0).
Ring k=1: numbers 2..9. But for k=1: start at (2k-1)^2+1 =1^2+1=2, ok. max=(2k+1)^2=3^2=9, ok.

So ring k=1: numbers 2..9 (side length 3).
Ring k=2: numbers 10..25 (side length 5).
Ring k=3: numbers 26..49 (side length 7).
Indeed: ring k: side length = 2k+1, last number in ring = (2k+1)^2.

So 2025=45^2 ⇒ (2k+1)=45 ⇒ 2k=44 ⇒ k=22 ⇒ last number of ring k=22 is 2025.

So 2026 is ring k=23? But ring k=23 would start at (2k-1)^2+1=(45)^2+1 = 2025+1=2026. Yes!
So 2026 is first number of ring k=23.

---

## **3. Coordinates of first number in ring k**
In this **clockwise** spiral:
First number of ring k is placed just to the right of bottom-right number of previous ring.

Coordinates of last number of ring k-1: bottom-right corner: coordinates (k-1, -(k-1))? Let's check small k.

For k=1: ring k=1 starts with number 2 at (1,0). Last of previous ring k=0: number 1 at (0,0), just to the right is (1,0), yes.

For k=2: ring k=2 starts with number 10 at (2,-1). Let's test: Last of ring k=1=9 at coordinate (1,-1). Just to the right is (2,-1), yes.

Pattern:
Last number of ring k-1 is at (k-1, -(k-1)).
First of ring k (N_start=(2k-1)^2+1) is at (k-1+1, -(k-1)) = (k, -(k-1)).

Test k=2: (2, -1) ok. k=1: (1,0) ok.

So for k=23: Start of ring k=23: coordinates (23, -(22)) = (23, -22).

Thus **2026 is at (23,-22)**.

---

## **4. 8 neighbors of (23,-22)**  
Coordinates:  
E: (24,-22)  
NE: (24,-21)  
N: (23,-21)  
NW: (22,-21)  
W: (22,-22)  
SW: (22,-23)  
S: (23,-23)  
SE: (24,-23)

---

## **5. Find numbers at those positions**
We know 2026 is first number of ring k=23: N_start = (2*23-1)^2+1=45^2+1=2026.

We can compute coordinates relative to ring start to find numbers.

Length of side m= 2k+1=47.  
Numbers go right-up-left-down: first move right only 1 step… wait: Pattern for first side of ring k (right side):  
The first number is at (k, -(k-1)). From there, we go **up** (since we started just to the right of previous ring's bottom-right, up along right side). The “right side” of ring m=47 has 47 numbers total? Let’s recall layout:

Ring k has side length m=2k+1. The first number is on the right side, bottom cell excluding corner? Actually right side: coordinates starting (k, -(k-1)), (k, -k+2), …, up to (k, k). Wait k=23→ side=47: from (23,-22) up to (23,23)?? Let's check:

Right side: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k), length:  k - (-(k-1)) + 1 = 2k. That’s not matching m=2k+1. So I’m confusing. Let’s derive smaller scale.

k=2: ring starts at (2,-1) number 10. Right side: coords (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)? Not (2,3) because max y=k=2. Check: sequence for ring k=2 (n=10..25):  
Right side: 10 at (2,-1),11 at (2,0),12 at (2,1),13 at (2,2). That's length=4? But m=5; yes: top-right corner belongs to top side.

Anyway, we don’t need full enumeration— we need neighbors.  

Better: Use coordinates relative to ring start to compute offsets and neighbor numbers.

General method: In ring k, number N has coordinates computable by figuring offset from N_start= ((2k-1)^2+1).

Let pos=N - N_start.

Right side (pos=0..m-2=0..2k-1): m=2k+1. Upwards movement: pos=0:(k,-(k-1)), pos increases: y increases by 1 each.

So coords: x=k, y= -(k-1)+pos. For pos=0..(2k-1).

Test k=23: N_start=2026 at (23,-22). For pos=0:  y=-22, x=23.

Thus neighbors offsets from (23,-22):

Coordinates:  
E: (24,-22): to get (24,-22), note that right side x=k=23 fixed in right side. So E is on next ring? Actually x=24, y=-22: maybe x=23+1 outward — so along top side of next segment? Might be easier to brute-force logicically:

---

We can cheat logically: On right side:

For (23,-22), its neighbor E (24,-22) is outside ring k=23; The next ring k=24 starts at 2026+something big … Actually, ring k=23 ends at (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209.

E (x=24,y=-22): is x=24>23, so it's on right side of next ring? No — ring k=23 outer boundary has x from -23 to 23? Wait no: ring k edges: Right at x=k=23, Top y=k=23, Left x=-k=-23, Bottom y=-k=-23. So any x>23 is ring k+1.  

Coordinate (24,-22): x=24, that’s ring k+1=24. That number will be slightly offset from start of ring 24 which starts late. So E belongs to next ring far away →  We must compute using coordinates→number formula.

---

Better: Derive from known location: For given point (x,y), find its ring r = max(|x|,|y|). Actually outermost coordinate: ring r = max(|x|,|y|).

Then: if |x|=r and x>0 (right side) or similar to compute its number.

Known formula: Let r = max(|x|,|y|).

If r=0: n=1.

If x=r and y>-r: we are on right side (excluding bottom corner which belongs to bottom side). Actually careful:

It’s easier to note that Ulam spiral numbering works by: Start ring r (r=1,2,…) first number (2r-1)^2+1 at (r, 1-r), going up until (r,r), then left, then down, then right.

But for neighbors maybe reverse: Given (x,y), compute n.

Nevertheless, to avoid huge derivation, maybe easier: consider 8 points:  

We know 2026=(23,-22). Let r23: ring r=23 has y ranges -23..23, x ranges -23..23. 2026 is on right side x=23, y=-22 (since -(r-1)=-22). So neighbors:

E: (24,-22): ring r’= max(24,22)=24 >23 so it's in next outer ring r=24.

N: (23,-21): x=23, y=-21. In right side (x=r=23 and y>-23), so position on right side: offset from N_start = y - (-(r-1)) = -21-(-22) = 1 → so number = N_start + 1 = 2027.

NE: (24,-21): ring 24.

NW: (22,-21): max(|22|,21)=22→ ring r=22 (inner ring). Bottom side: check later.

W: (22,-22): max(|22|,22)=22→ ring r=22, on bottom side maybe.

SW: (22,-23): ring r=23? Wait: y=-23→max(|22|,23)=23→ ring 23: left side? No, it’s bottom side (y=-23,x<23).

S: (23,-23): on bottom side (y=-r=-23, x=right? Actually: Bottom side: y=-23, x from -23..22? Actually bottom side corners: BR (23,-23), BL (-23,-23). So (23,-23) is bottom-right corner (last num in ring r=23=2025!). Check: Bottom-right corner number: (2r+1)^2? Wait earlier: Last of ring k=22 was 2025. But (23,-23) is bottom-right corner for r=23: side m=47. Wait contradiction: earlier said ring k=22 last=2025 at coords (22,-22). ring index here r=23: contains 2026 at start; m=47; last=(2r+1)^2? That can't be: when r=23, m=47, last=47^2=2209.  

Anyway: So for (23,-23): y=-23, x=23 → bottom-right corner of ring r=23 has number m^2=(47)^2=2209? Wait: For r=23, m=2r+1=47. We must be consistent index!

Actually index confusion: earlier ring k=22 ⇒ last=45^2=2025. Then 2026 in what they call ring k=23 has m=47? Then last of that ring=2209. But 2026 at (r,-r+1)=(23,-22) if r=23. That fits: r=max(|x|,|y|)=23.

So (23,-23): y=-r=-23, x=r=23 ⇒ bottom-right corner ⇒ number=?? It's the last number of ring r=23. Formula: First of ring r is (2r-3)^2+1 for r>=2? No: Ring r has side m=2r-1?? Check: r=1: side=3? Yes: max coord r=1 ⇒ m=3. r=2: m=5. So m=2r-1, not 2r+1. Yes! Derivation:  

Rightmost x=r, leftmost x=-r, so width=2r+1? Wait: total side m=2r+1? For r=1: m=3=2*1+1. Yes! So m=2r+1. Right. Earlier I had r=k but flipped.

So: r=max(|x|,|y|), side m=2r+1. Ring r starts at: first= ((m-2)^2+1) actually: previous ring r-1 had m’=2(r-1)+1=2r-1. Square previous=(m’)^2= (2r-1)^2. So first of ring r=(2r-1)^2+1.

Earlier: r=23: first= (45)^2+1=2026. Yes! m=2r+1=47. Last in ring r= m^2=2209.

---

Within ring r, (x,y) position: we can find offset.

Given r=23, first=2026 at (r,1-r)=(23,-22).

Right side: x=23, y from -22 up to 23: length=46? Wait length = (23 - (-22)+1)=46 ? That's m-1=46. Right side length m-1=46.

Top side: y=23, x from 22 down to -23 length m-1.

Left side: x=-23, y from 22 down to -22 length m-1.

Bottom side: y=-23, x from -22 up to 23 length m-1.

---

(23,-22): pos = y - (1-r) = y - (1-23) = y+22 = -22+22=0. So offset=0 ⇒ N=2026.

Neighbor N: (23,-21): offset= y+22=1 ⇒ N=2027. Good.

Neighbor NW: (22,-21): max(|22|,21)=22 ⇒ ring r=22. Is this bottom side? r=22: bottom side is y=-22? Wait check: Ring r=22: m=45, first=(43)^2+1=1850 at (22,-21)? Actually first of ring r=22: formula: (2r-1)^2+1=(43)^2+1=1849+1=1850 at (r,1-r)=(22,-21). Yes! So (22,-21) = start of ring 22! Number=1850.

Neighbor W: (22,-22): max(|22|,22)=22,y=-22⇒ ring r=22 bottom side? Coordinates relative to ring r=22 start=(22,-21). We are (0,-1) from start: start's offset=0. So offset of bottom side: diff in y: -22-(-21)=-1⇒? Actually bottom side goes from x=21 down to x=-21 maybe. We must derive:

But easier: We can actually compute coordinates→number directly by square layer.

We know bottom side of ring r: y=-r, x from -r+1 to r. So (22,-22): y=-r=-22⇒ on bottom side of ring r=22. Offset from bottom-left corner: bottom-left corner of ring r=22: (-22,-22)? No, bottom-left is (-r,-r) = (-22,-22) — but that’s corner between left and bottom? Actually: ring r=22 bottom side: from x=-21 to x=22? Let’s recall: For ring r: start at (r,1-r)=(22,-21) in right side (x=22). Up to (22,22) top-right corner, then left along top y=22: down to x=-22 → (-22,22) top-left, then down left side x=-22 → (-22,-21) y decreases to -22. Wait (-22,-22) bottom-left?? Then bottom side x increases from -22 to 21? Or 22? Hmm, messy.

Simpler: just note: Given 2026 at (23,-22):

8 neighbors coordinates:

List:
E (24,-22)  
NE (24,-21)  
N (23,-21)  
NW (22,-21)  
W (22,-22)  
SW (22,-23)  
S (23,-23)  
SE (24,-23)

---

Need function N(x,y):

Step 1: r=max(|x|,|y|)

Step 2: compute start of ring r: N_start=(2r-1)^2+1.

Step 3: find on which side of square:

If y = -r ⇒ bottom side ⇒ offset = r-1+x, if x<r etc. Wait:

Cases:
Right side: x=r and y<r ⇒ offset = y-(1-r) = y-(1-r) = y+r-1. So N = N_start+offset.

Top side: y=r and x<r ⇒ offset = (m-1) + (r-x), actually:  
Right side length m-1=2r, then top side: offset=2r+(r-x)=3r-x.

Left side: x=-r and y>-r ⇒ offset = (m-1)*2 + (r-y)=? Let’s not mess. Rather: ring r: total per ring = 8r numbers arranged as: right: 2r numbers?? Wait m=2r+1, not 8r. Actually perimeters=4*(2r)=8r.

Let’s derive systematically numerically for few small known r:

Given small: r=1: start=2 at (1,0). Upward to (1,1), left to (-1,1), down to (-1,-1), right to (1,-1) enclosing.

Better to use “spiral coordinates→number” known trick:

But for time: Let’s compute logically small offsets.

Actually known: Since 2026's N_start=2026 at (23,-22), ring r=23. Others:  

NW (22,-21):  

Max(|22|,21)=22 ⇒ ring r=22: start=1850 at (22,-21). Are coordinates (22,-21) same as start? offset=0⇒NW=1850.

W (22,-22):

Ring r=22: y=-22 → equals -r ⇒ bottom side of ring r=22: bottom side start at (-22,-22)? Actually bottom-left corner (-22,-22) is last of previous ring r-1=21? No, bottom-left corner belongs to this ring.

Let’s compute bottom side length m-1=2r=44. Points: start of bottom side: y=-22, x from -21 to 22? No: Actually bottom side runs from x=-21 to x=22 inclusive length=44. The start of bottom side: first pt on bottom side sequence is right after bottom-left corner (-22,-22). Check order: Top-left to bottom-left is left side downward, bottom-left corner (-22,-22) then bottom side rightward to (22,-22). But bottom-left corner coordinate (-22,-22) is part of left side?? Actually earlier: left side ends at (-22,-22). Bottom side begins at (-22,-22)? Then steps right: (-21,-22), (-20,-22),...,(22,-22).

So (22,-22) is last element of bottom side ⇒ offset = 44. Now N for bottom side: offset from start of ring: total before bottom side: right side length=2r=44, top side length=44, left side length=44, sum=132. Bottom side length=44. So total=176 in ring r=22 N_start=1850.

Thus N_start + 132=1850+132=1982 first bottom side (-21,-22). Then offset within bottom side: x=22⇒ offset=22-(-21)=43. So N=1982+43=2025!

Yes: so W=2025.

So neighbors: NW=1850, W=2025.

SW (22,-23):

r= max(22,23)=23⇒ ring r=23. y=-23=-r⇒ bottom side of ring r=23.

Bottom side sequence length=2r=46. Within ring r=23: right side:46, top:46, left:46 then bottom:46. N_start=2026. First bottom side: starting after left side ends at (-23,-23), bottom from (-22,-23) to (23,-23).

Offset within bottom side for x=22: from (-22) to 22: 22-(-22)=44. Before bottom side: right+top+left=138. So N=2026+138+44=2208?? Check: bottom starts after left ends at (-23,-23). Let’s compute:  

Right side: offset0..45 covering coords: (23,-22)→(23,23): then top side: offset46..91 covering (22,23)→(-23,23); then left side offset92..137 covering (-23,22)→(-23,-23); then bottom side offset138..183 covering (-22,-23)→(23,-23).

So SW (22,-23): bottom offset= x-(-22)=22+22=44. So SW=2026+138+44=2026+182=2208.

S (23,-23):

Bottom side: x=23, bottom length=46, x=23 is last element of bottom side: relative x=-22→23 offset=45. So S=2026+138+45=2209.

SE (24,-23):

x=24 ⇒ r=24. Next outer ring: But r=24: start=(2*24-1)^2+1=47^2+1=2209+1=2210 at (24,-23)? Wait ring r=24 starts at (24,-23) ⇒ yes, so SE at (24,-23) =2210.

E (24,-22):

Ring r=24 start=2210 at (24,-23). (24,-22): offset from start (24,-23): y=-22 versus start y=-23 ⇒ offset=1 ⇒ E=2211.

NE (24,-21):

Ring r=24 start at (24,-23), offset= y+23=-21+23=2 ⇒ NE=2212.

N (23,-21) earlier=2027.

---

So neighbors: NW=1850, W=2025, SW=2208, S=2209, SE=2210, E=2211, NE=2212, N=2027.

---

Check consistency: S=2209, SE=2210… makes sense.

---

**Sum all 8:**

1850 + 2025 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2027  

Pair: 1850+2025=3875  
2208+2209=4417 → sum with 3875=8292  
2210+2211=4421 → 8292+4421=12713  
2212+2027=4239 → 12713+4239=16952.

Also check quickly: mean ≈ 2100×8=16800 close.

---

Thus:

\[
\boxed{16952}
\]

Final answer is **16952**.
