## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern starting from 1 and moving outward in a clockwise direction. We need to understand how this pattern works to locate the number 2026 and its neighbors.

## Step 2: Locate the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the number 2026, we first need to determine which layer of the spiral it is on. The spiral is made up of layers, with each layer having a certain range of numbers. By analyzing the pattern, we can see that the first layer (numbers 1-9) is a 3x3 grid, the second layer (numbers 10-25) is a 5x5 grid, the third layer (numbers 26-49) is a 7x7 grid, and so on. Since 2026 is between 2025 and 2100 (the start and end of a layer), we can calculate which layer it belongs to.

## Step 3: Determine the layer of the number 2026
Each layer n has a side length of 2n + 1, and the number of elements in each layer can be calculated as (2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 8n. Starting from n = 1, we sum these elements until we reach or surpass 2026. For n = 1, we have 1-9 (9 numbers), n = 2 gives 10-25 (16 numbers), n = 3 gives 26-49 (24 numbers), and so on. Continuing, for n = 4, we have 50-81, n = 5 gives 82-121, n = 6 gives 122-169, n = 7 gives 170-225, n = 8 gives 226-289, n = 9 gives 290-361, n = 10 gives 362-441, n = 11 gives 442-529, n = 12 gives 530-625, n = 13 gives 626-729, n = 14 gives 730-841, n = 15 gives 842-961, n = 16 gives 962-1089, n = 17 gives 1090-1225, n = 18 gives 1226-1369, n = 19 gives 1370-1521, n = 20 gives 1522-1681, n = 21 gives 1682-1849, n = 22 gives 1850-2025. The number 2026 starts the next layer, so it is the first number on the 23rd layer.

## Step 4: Calculate the positions of the neighbors
Given that 2026 is at the start of the 23rd layer, its position is at the bottom left corner of this layer. To find the sum of its neighbors, we need to understand the layout of numbers around it. The neighbors will be the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals), but since 2026 is at the edge of the spiral, some of its neighbors are on the previous layer.

## Step 5: Calculate the values of the neighbors
On the 22nd layer, the numbers range from 1850 to 2025. The bottom left corner of the 22nd layer is 2025. The numbers directly above, to the left, and diagonally above-left and above-right of 2026 are all on the 22nd layer or earlier layers. Since the spiral pattern wraps around, we can deduce the numbers adjacent to 2026 by considering the pattern and the positions of the numbers on the grid.

## Step 6: Identify the neighbors of 2026
Given the position of 2026 at the start of the 23rd layer, its bottom left neighbor is the last number of the 22nd layer, which is 2025. The neighbor to the right of 2026 is 2027, and the one above it is 2024 (wrapping around the spiral). The remaining neighbors can be calculated by continuing to follow the spiral pattern. The top neighbor of 2026 will be on the 21st layer (since it's the layer before the 22nd), which ends with 1849. By moving one step to the left on the 21st layer, we get 1848. Then, moving to the left of 2026, we find 2025. The diagonal neighbors can be similarly deduced.

## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Once we have identified all the neighbors, we can sum their values to find the total. Given the symmetry of the spiral and its wrapping nature, the neighbors of 2026 will include a mix of numbers from the end of the 22nd layer and the beginning of the 23rd layer, as well as numbers from the preceding layers due to the wrapping around of the spiral.

## Step 8: Explicit calculation of neighbors
The neighbors are: 2025 (bottom), 2027 (right), 2024 (top), 2023 (top-left), 2028 (right-bottom), 2029 (right-top), 2022 (left-top), and 2020 (left-bottom). The sum of these numbers will give us the desired result.

## Step 9: Perform the sum
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2028 + 2029 + 2022 + 2020.

## Step 10: Final calculation
Sum = 2025 + 2027 = 4052, 4052 + 2024 = 6076, 6076 + 2023 = 8099, 8099 + 2028 = 10127, 10127 + 2029 = 12156, 12156 + 2022 = 14178, 14178 + 2020 = 16198.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16198}$
