## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern shows the numbers 1 to 9. To find the pattern, we notice that the numbers increase in a spiral sequence. This sequence starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction.


## Step 2: Identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
We need to determine the position of the number 2026 in this spiral. To find this position, we must understand the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located.


## Step 3: Calculate the layer of the spiral for the number 2026
Each layer of the spiral contains a certain number of elements. The first layer (1 to 9) contains 9 elements, the second layer (10 to 25) contains 16 elements, the third layer (26 to 49) contains 25 elements, and so on.


## Step 4: Determine which layer the number 2026 belongs to
To find the layer of 2026, we can calculate the cumulative number of elements up to each layer until we reach or exceed 2026. We note that the sequence of the number of elements in each layer follows a pattern of increasing by 8, then 16, then 24, and so on, adding 8 more to the increment each time.


## Step 5: Calculate the position of 2026 within its layer
Once we identify the layer of 2026, we need to find its position within that layer. This will help us identify its neighbors.


## Step 6: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of a number in the spiral are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the four diagonals. Since 2026 is not on the edge of the spiral, it will have 8 neighbors.


## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026
After identifying the neighbors, we need to calculate their sum.


## Step 8: Apply the formula or pattern to find the sum of the neighbors
In this spiral, each number is the average of its neighbors. Thus, the sum of the neighbors of any number is equal to 8 times the number itself, given the symmetric nature of the spiral and how numbers are distributed.


The final answer is: $\boxed{16208}$
