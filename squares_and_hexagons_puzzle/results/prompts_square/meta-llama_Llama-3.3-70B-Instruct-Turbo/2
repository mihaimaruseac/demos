## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The numbers on the spiral are laid out in a pattern where the number increases as we move outward from the center. The given representation shows that the numbers are arranged in a clockwise manner.

## Step 2: Identify the position of the number 2026
To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral pattern. This requires understanding the sequence in which numbers are filled in the spiral.

## Step 3: Analyze the sequence of numbers in the spiral
Looking at the pattern, we can observe that the sequence starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction. The numbers increase as we move away from the center.

## Step 4: Determine the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located
The spiral can be divided into layers, with each layer containing a certain number of elements. The first layer (the center) contains 1 element, the second layer contains 8 elements (from 2 to 9), the third layer contains 16 elements, and so on. Each layer contains 8 more elements than the previous one.

## Step 5: Calculate the layer where 2026 is located
To find the layer where 2026 is located, we can start by adding the number of elements in each layer until we reach or exceed 2026. The layers are as follows:
- Layer 1: 1 element (1)
- Layer 2: 8 elements (2-9), total = 1 + 8 = 9
- Layer 3: 16 elements (10-25), total = 9 + 16 = 25
- Layer 4: 24 elements (26-49), total = 25 + 24 = 49
- Layer 5: 32 elements (50-81), total = 49 + 32 = 81
- Layer 6: 40 elements (82-121), total = 81 + 40 = 121
- Layer 7: 48 elements (122-169), total = 121 + 48 = 169
- Layer 8: 56 elements (170-225), total = 169 + 56 = 225
- Layer 9: 64 elements (226-289), total = 225 + 64 = 289
- Layer 10: 72 elements (290-361), total = 289 + 72 = 361
- Layer 11: 80 elements (362-441), total = 361 + 80 = 441
- Layer 12: 88 elements (442-529), total = 441 + 88 = 529
- Layer 13: 96 elements (530-625), total = 529 + 96 = 625
- Layer 14: 104 elements (626-729), total = 625 + 104 = 729
- Layer 15: 112 elements (730-841), total = 729 + 112 = 841
- Layer 16: 120 elements (842-961), total = 841 + 120 = 961
- Layer 17: 128 elements (962-1089), total = 961 + 128 = 1089
- Layer 18: 136 elements (1090-1225), total = 1089 + 136 = 1225
- Layer 19: 144 elements (1226-1369), total = 1225 + 144 = 1369
- Layer 20: 152 elements (1370-1521), total = 1369 + 152 = 1521
- Layer 21: 160 elements (1522-1681), total = 1521 + 160 = 1681
- Layer 22: 168 elements (1682-1849), total = 1681 + 168 = 1849
- Layer 23: 176 elements (1850-2025), total = 1849 + 176 = 2025
- Layer 24: 184 elements (2026-2209), total = 2025 + 184

2026 is located in the 24th layer.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is located at the start of the 24th layer, its neighbors are the last 3 numbers of the 23rd layer (2023, 2024, 2025), the first 4 numbers of the 24th layer (2026, 2027, 2028, 2029), and the number above and to the left of 2026, not in the same layer, (2019 and 2022). However, considering the spiral pattern, we realize that the direct neighbors of any number not on the edge are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it in a straight line, as well as the four diagonals. Given 2026's position, its neighbors are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (to the right)
- 2023 (above-left)
- 2024 (above)
- 2028 (below)
- 2029 (below-right)
- 2019 (above-right)
- 2022 (to the left and above 2025)

Thus, the sum of these neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2019 + 2022

## Step 7: Perform the calculation of the sum of the 8 neighbors
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2019 + 2022

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2019 + 2022
= 2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2019 + 2022
= 16301

The final answer is: $\boxed{16302}$
