## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern starting from the center. The pattern starts with 1 and increases as it spirals outward.

## Step 2: Determine the layer of the number 2026
To find the layer where 2026 is located, we first need to understand the sequence of the numbers in the spiral. The sequence of numbers on the corners of each layer (starting from the center) is: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, 289, 361, 441, 529, 625, 729, 841, 961, 1089, 1217, 1369, 1525, 1681, 1849, 2025. The number 2026 will be on the next layer after 2025.

## Step 3: Calculate the side length of the layer where 2026 is located
Since 2025 is a perfect square (45^2), the layer where 2026 is located starts at 2025 + 1 = 2026. This means 2026 is on the edge of the 45th layer (counting from the center as layer 0) but for the purposes of finding neighbors, we consider it part of a larger square with sides of length 2*45 + 1 = 91.

## Step 4: Find the position of 2026
2026 is located at the start of the 45th layer, on the right edge of the square, one position after the bottom right corner of the previous layer.

## Step 5: Identify the neighbors
The neighbors of a cell in a grid are the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right, as well as the four diagonals. However, for a cell on the edge (like 2026), some of these positions will be outside the grid. The neighbors of 2026 will include the numbers directly adjacent in all eight directions, considering wrapping around the grid is not applicable in this context since we're looking at a specific layer's edge.

## Step 6: Calculate the neighbors
Given 2026's position, we consider the immediate neighbors in all eight directions:
- Top: 2025
- Top-right: 2027
- Right: Not applicable as 2026 is on the right edge, so we consider the number inside the spiral, 2028 is not a direct neighbor, we need to look at the pattern.
- Bottom-right: 2029
- Bottom: 2030
- Bottom-left: 2031
- Left: 2024
- Top-left: 2023
We need the actual numbers in these positions, but we've identified the theoretical positions.

## Step 7: Correctly identify the neighbors based on the spiral's structure
Considering the spiral's pattern and the fact that 2026 is at the edge of a new layer:
- The actual numbers are consecutive in the spiral's progression.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Given the positions, the sum of all 8 neighbors is: 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2024 + 2023.

## Step 9: Perform the sum
2025 + 2027 = 4052, 4052 + 2028 = 6080, 6080 + 2029 = 8110, 8110 + 2030 = 10140, 10140 + 2031 = 12171, 12171 + 2024 = 14195, 14195 + 2023 = 16218.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16218}$
