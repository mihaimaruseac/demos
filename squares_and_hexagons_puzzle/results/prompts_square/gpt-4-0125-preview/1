To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral pattern, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral. Spirals of natural numbers can be tricky to visualize without drawing, but we can use some observations about the structure of such spirals to help us out.

The square layers of the spiral increase in size in a predictable way. The first layer, containing just the number 1, is of size \(1\times1\). The next layer, containing the numbers 2 through 9, is \(3\times3\), and so on, increasing in size by 2 for each layer to keep the square shape (5x5, 7x7, etc.).

Each complete layer (beyond the first 1x1) adds an odd square to the sequence, starting from 3x3=9, 5x5=25, 7x7=49, etc., and the largest number in each layer's square is an odd square (\(3^2\), \(5^2\), \(7^2\), ...).

Knowing this, let's determine which layer 2026 falls into:

1. \(3^2 = 9\) for the first layer.
2. Next, \(5^2 = 25\), \(7^2 = 49\), etc.

We continue until we find the first square number larger than 2026.

To find the ring that contains 2026 without manually checking each, note the general form for the number of elements in an \(n\)-th square (ignoring the first singular center). The size of the square is defined by the formula for the perimeter of squares in the spiral, which goes 8, 16, 24, ... i.e., \(8n\), but to identify the square we're concerned with the squares of odd numbers as the last number of each layer.

For simplicity in calculation, we can skip directly trying to calculate the precise layer and consider a simpler approach to directly estimate and then narrow down to the specifics around the number 2026.


A square formed by any odd number \(n\) will have \(n^2\) as the largest number. Let's approximate where 2026 might fall:

- \(44^2 = 1936\)
- \(45^2 = 2025\)
- \(46^2 = 2116\)

Thus, 2026 is on the layer that starts right after \(45^2 = 2025\) and is headed towards \(46^2 = 2116\), making it clear that 2026 is the first number after \(2025\) in a new layer, which means it starts the outer layer just after the perfect square of \(45^2\).

For the sum of the neighbors of a number immediately following a perfect square in this spiral setup, it is visually geometric and systematic. Given 2026 is immediately after 2025 (a perfect square ending a layer), its neighbors will be:

- Directly before it (2025, the perfect square)
- The entire previous ring's "corners" and the numbers adjacent to these corners (since it starts a new layer)

Specific numbers are hard to state without more context, but since 2026 is at the start of a new layer (the outer layer adjacent to 2025), the neighbors include 2025 and numbers in the positions that would typically surround a number at such a junction. However, we can precisely say 2025 is a direct neighbor.

For a generic calculation without knowing the exact positions and owing to the description's nature (without mapping each step), knowing the exact sum of all 8 neighbors precisely requires more detailed calculation that takes into account the spiral growth pattern. However, in this specific case, since we're immediately after a square number, we can highlight that aspect.

Specifically, since 2026 is just after 2025, its neighbors by the pattern it follows, for a number immediately following a square in the spiral, includes:

- The square number itself (2025),
- The numbers that would follow in the sequence around it.

Given we can't delineate each number without a more detailed mapping through the spiral growth, the critical insight here is recognizing 2026's pivotal position, making it just:

\[2025 + (7 \times \text{sequential increment from 2025}) = 2025 + (1+2+3+4+5+6+7) = 2025 + 28 = 2053\]

But remember, this simplistic approach assumes consecutive addition around the square without considering the actual spatial arrangement in a spiral, which would not follow a simple numbered sequence due to the spiral nature.

To correct for a misunderstanding in the approach: Given 2026's placement just after a perfect square, determining its neighbors specifically would differ from the simplified sequence. The accurate calculation would rely on understanding its position relative to the spiral's actual layout, which typically surrounds it with elements in a practically circular (in terms of grid layout) formation. For an exact sum from here, we'd need to follow the spiral's logic and layout intricately, which isn't fully detailed in the preceding explanation. 

Based on the precise pattern of incremental growth in a spiral, without stepping through the spiral manually or utilizing a specific formula tailored for adjacent numbers in such a pattern, extracting the exact neighbors and their sum requires an understanding of that spatial progression. Nonetheless, given the strategic position of 2026, most neighbors (excluding 2025) would advance sequentially in the spiral surrounding it, influenced by its square layout transition. For an accurate sum, consider that direct computation or algorithmic assistance might be needed to account for all neighbors correctly.
