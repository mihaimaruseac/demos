To solve this, it'll be very helpful to notice the pattern of the squares of odd numbers along the bottom right diagonal (1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ...), which are \(1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2\), etc. This pattern aids in locating the position of a given number in the grid.

### 1. Find the Odd Square Below 2026

The first step is to find an odd square number that is less than 2026 but as close to it as possible. It's helpful to note that:
- \(1^2 = 1\)
- \(3^2 = 9\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)
- \(7^2 = 49\)
- \(45^2 = 2025\)
- \(47^2 = 2209\)

Here, \(45^2 = 2025\) is right below 2026, indicating 2026 is located just after the square of 45 on the spiral. Thus 2026 is at the start of a new layer around the center, moving towards the right of 2025 in the sequence.

### 2. Determine the Neighbors of 2026

Knowing 2026's position allows us to deduce the numbers around it by using the structure of the grid. For the purposes of simplification, I'll list the neighbors in clockwise order starting from the one directly above (which would be in a similar or nearby position as square numbers follow a predictable pattern).

However, since 2026 is on a corner just beyond \(45^2 = 2025\), its immediate neighbors are quite straightforward to deduce based on the spiral's growth pattern:
- The square below it, \(45^2\), which is 2025.
- The numbers around 2026 will mostly involve numbers directly before and after 2025, and then moving outward in the spiral.

Being at the start of a new layer, its neighbors include:
- Directly before 2025 and after 2026, based on the spiral's growth pattern, we get:
  - To the left of 2025 (which is 2024),
  - Below 2025, and to the "bottom left" of 2025—however, this sequence involves calculating further neighbors specifically, and directly, there isn't an immediate pattern to infer the next sequence without tracing the spiral around.
- For 2026 itself, it'll have 2025 to its immediate left, and numbers increasing in sequence around it because it sits just after an odd square.

To better approach this, let's classify the neighbors directly:
- Left (2025, directly after \(45^2\)),
- The immediate lower layers without specific calculation can be difficult to precisely enumerate without manual or algorithmic tracing of the spiral due to how the spiral pattern expands, especially towards the corners and sides.

Given the spiral pattern and understanding that numbers increase as they spiral outwards, and focusing on the specific placement of 2026 right after an odd square's square (2025):

- **Above**: It would follow the pattern moving into a new layer but is not as simple to deduce without knowing the full traversal pattern of the sequence.
- **Below and around (left, right, diagonals)**: These are even harder to calculate without the manual mapping of numbers since the specific sequence alters the further from the square you move.

However, recognizing the error in calculation complexity here: the exact neighbors (meaning the eight surrounding numbers) involve a deeper insight into the spiral pattern; straightforwardly, the number immediately before it (2025) will be a neighbor on one side, and other neighbors follow in spiral sequence around it from 2024 decreasing and 2027 increasing, but the exact arrangement heavily depends on the specific orientation given the spiral path.

To exactly solve for all eight neighbors and correctly summarize their sum around 2026 without direct sequence mapping for each step risks inaccuracies. A more detailed pattern recognition or algorithm would precisely detail each neighbor based on the spiral's growth logic. Apologies for the oversight in directly addressing the calculation of precise neighbors without this algorithmic or mapped pattern insight.
