To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the described spiral grid, we first need to identify the positions of these neighbors relative to 2026 and then calculate their values.

The spiral grid marks numbers in a particular pattern where each square layer contains numbers in an increasing sequence spiraling towards the center. Generally, the top-right corner numbers of each expanding square layer (ending at 1, 9, 25, 49, ...) follow the pattern of odd squared numbers \((1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, ...)\). This sequence allows us to approximate the location of 2026 and determine its neighboring numbers.

First, let's identify which square layer 2026 falls into. We know that the layer's corners are odd squares. Since \(\sqrt{2026}\) is between \(44\) and \(45\), we need to find the first odd square greater than 2026, which is \(2025 = 45^2\).

Given this, we can discern that 2026 lies just one step beyond the square formed up to 2025, suggesting it's on the layer that extends from \(45^2\) to \(47^2\) but very close to the lower left corner starting the next layer. For \(45^2\), it marks a bottom right corner. Since 2026 is just one number beyond \(45^2\), it is on the left side of \(2025 (45^2)\).

The positions relative to 2026 can be determined as follows in a clockwise manner starting from the top (but considering the spiral's orientation):

- Above 2026: \(2025\)
- Above-left of 2026: \(2024\)
- Left of 2026: \(2023\)
- Bottom-left of 2026: \(2022\)
- Below 2026: It would be 1 fewer than the number to the right of 2026, but calculating this directly is complicated. However, from the pattern, numbers decrease as we move around the square counter-clockwise, so this would be the next in sequence, \(2027\).
- Bottom-right of 2026 is \(2028\).
- Right of 2026, given the nature of the layers, would then be \(2029\).
- Above-right of 2026 would have to be “above” the next outer layer so it would jump ahead more significantly if we were to follow the direct sequence without exact positional reference, indicating a misunderstanding in the direct layout since 2026 being immediately next to 2025 would suggest a specific positioning that doesn't align with right or bottom-right positions being sequentially next in conventional terms.

Thus, my initial explanation might have led to a bit of positional confusion as it assumed a perfectly sequential increase around 2026, which might not align with the actual spiral logic when considering the square grid's geometrical increase pattern.

For an accurate calculation without this geometric confusion:
- The positions around a given number n in a spiral can't be directly calculated without understanding its exact position (edge, corner) in the grid.

But to directly respond without a precise positional diagram, a better approach for such a complex sequence might involve understanding the precise formula or algorithm used to generate the positions in the spiral, which isn't provided here in a straightforward mathematical way due to a misunderstanding of the spiral's directionality affecting the sequence. My explanation assumed a simplified continuation of sequential numbers directly around 2026 without acknowledging the spiral's complex geometrical progression that impacts the arrangement of numbers around any given point, such as 2026. 

This complex scenario illustrates the intricate nature of positioning within a non-linear numerical layout, showcasing that without a clearer algorithmic or sequential formulation, one can unfortunately easily misconstrue the relational positioning of numbers in such a spiral grid. 

For the exact sum of neighbors or more specific characteristics about numbers like 2026 in a spiral, a clear algorithm or formula specific to generating and positioning numbers within the grid is requisite. Given the initial framework and identification of a mistake in my explanation approach, I recommend seeking a clearer, algorithmically defined solution for pinpointing neighbors in such a complex sequence.
