To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral layout, we first need to understand the pattern in which numbers are laid out and then determine the position of 2026. In a spiral that starts with 1 in the center and spirals outward, numbers are arranged in concentric squares. 

To simplify, here's how we can think about the problem:

1. **Determine the "layer" or "level" of 2026 in the spiral**: The square layers expand outward, with each outer square containing numbers higher than the previous square. The first layer (the center) contains just the number 1. The second layer, which is a 3x3 square, ends with the number 9. The third layer, a 5x5 square, ends with 25, and so on. Each layer ends with the square of an odd number (3^2, 5^2, 7^2, etc.).

2. **Calculate the side length of the layer containing 2026**: This can be determined by finding the next odd square number after 2026. However, for the purpose of locating 2026, we're more interested in identifying its layer based on its proximity to these odd square numbers.

3. **Understand the pattern of numbers around 2026**: Once we know the layer 2026 is in, we can understand its position on the spiral. It's either on the bottom row, the right column, the top row, or the left column of its layer based on its value relative to the square numbers that define the corners of its layer.

#### Stepwise Solution:

Let's conceptualize how to efficiently get to the layer:

- The layers' ending numbers are 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, ..., which are squares of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ...
- We need to find \(\sqrt{2026}\) to understand where it lies. 

Quickly calculating or estimating, since \(44^2 = 1936\) and \(45^2 = 2025\), 2026 is just after 2025, which is \(45^2\), so it begins the layer just outside the square ending in 2025. 

Thus, 2026 is on the edge of this layer, starting immediately after a complete square, which means:

- It forms the beginning of a new layer.
- The numbers around 2026 are part of two layers, the layer inside ending with 2025, and the next layer starting with 2026. 

Given this is a new layer beginning, 2026 is directly after 2025 (\(45^2\)), one of the corners of the spiral. The numbers surround 2026 in the spiral would be:

- **Directly previous layer values**: Those before 2026, which are the numbers in the layer that ends with 2025. But since 2026 is at the start of a new outer layer (forming a corner position), it doesn’t have all neighbors like a center-positioned number would. In this starting corner position, in conceptual terms, it would be surrounded by the last number of the inner layer and the first numbers of the new layer, but with fewer neighbors due to its unique position. But, without visualizing or manually mapping larger spirals, providing exact neighbors is speculative.

However, given the uniqueness of the initial steps, it seems I may have approached this with an overly complex perspective for directly finding the neighbors without constructing or referencing a diagram for precise neighbor identification. 

In reality, directly calculating the neighbors of 2026 without exact sequential placement involves knowing its precise position, which is challenging to describe without understanding the layers' configuration. If your inquiry seeks a mathematical pattern or relationship for directly accessing neighbors in the spiral, such specific patterns could involve in-depth analysis of the spiral's structure, harmonizing both the layer position and the order of numbers within.

Given the initial setup, mistake in the approach of guessing without a clear mechanistic way to identify neighbors or any misinterpretation in delineating exact neighbors is acknowledged. For calculating neighbors and their sum with mathematical precision, reconsidering the exact positioning in a spiral layout is essentia emlrt
