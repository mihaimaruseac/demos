To solve this, we recognize that numbers on this spiral increase as we move outward from the center, where 1 is placed. This pattern forms concentric squares or "layers" around this center, each with an odd side length (3x3, 5x5, etc.). A key to solving this problem is determining what "layer" 2026 is on and its relative position in that layer.

First, let's determine the layer where 2026 lies. Each layer's maximum value is the square of an odd number: the center is 1 (a 1x1 square), the next layer ends at 9 (a 3x3 square), then 25 for the 5x5 square, and so on. This pattern continues with squares of side lengths 7, 9, 11, ...

We want to find the smallest odd square greater than 2026 to determine its layer. We'll calculate the side length of this layer:

- The first square greater than 2026 that's a perfect square of an odd number will define the outer boundary of the layer containing 2026.
  
### Step 1: Find the Outer Boundary
A quick calculation or educated guess can help. Since \(44^2 = 1936\) and \(45^2 = 2025\), it’s clear that \(45^2\) is too small, meaning \(2026\) is in the layer starting just after \(2025\), with \(46^2 = 2116\) being the next (and irrelevant for our boundary but helps us understand the max of this layer). The outer boundary for 2026's layer is defined by \(45^2 = 2025\), meaning the layer is in the range of numbers between \(2026\) and \(2125\) (since \(46^2 = 2116\), but \(2125\) is not relevant for our boundary, it was a misunderstanding). 

### Step 2: Determine 2026's Position and Calculate Neighbors
Knowing 2026 is just after 2025 and in the layer that starts with 2025 lets us understand it's near the start of this new layer, on the bottom right corner, moving toward the right (the structure of the spiral means numbers increase as you move counter-clockwise from the bottom right when on the outer edges of the spiral).

Since 2026 is the first number of its layer and lies directly after the perfect square \(2025\) (which is \(45^2\)), it occupies a corner position just outside the square formed by numbers up to 2025.

**Calculating Neighbors:**

Given this, the eight neighbors of 2026 in the spiral are partly the outer layer of numbers around 2025 (one layer in), and in this specific case, the neighbors are directly calculable based on their relative position:

- The neighbors directly adjacent to and including corners around 2026 would typically require us to calculate or visualize based on their position. However, knowing 2026 is one step into a new layer, several of its neighbors are easier to identify.

Since 2026 is at the beginning of a new outer ring, on a typical grid, its immediate neighbors would be parts of a sequence filling in around 2025. However, given the confusion this scenario may present without visual aids, it's crucial to correct the approach: 

1. The number immediately before 2026 is 2025, so one neighbor is 2025.
2. Without a depiction, specific neighbor values surrounding 2026 within the spiral become challenging to intuit due to the unique arrangement and the misinterpretation in the steps above.
   
Given the complexity introduced and without an exact method applied to calculate each neighboring position given this setup, it's apparent there's been a misunderstanding in translating the spiral's structure to this explanation. Direct calculation of neighbors for specific positions on this spiral involves identifying the ring's positioning and the patterned increment from the known square number (2025). Still, an accurate depiction requires meticulous calculation based on the spiral's growth pattern, which wasn't correctly detailed here.

### Correct Conceptual Approach (Without Exact Neighbors Calculation):
- Identify 2026's ring and exact position (done).
- Recognize it's at the beginning of the ring, making it adjacent to 2025 and proceeding numbers.
- Correctly map the rest of its neighbors based on the spiral’s expansion pattern, which wasn't precisely handled in this explanation. 

Apologies for any confusion. This demonstrates the complexity of visually decoding the spiral pattern without a direct mathematical formula to pinpoint neighbors and a mistake in my initial premises. For specific neighbor values around numbers in such a spiral, a step-by-step construct of the spiral or a more sophisticated mathematical model would ensure accuracy.
