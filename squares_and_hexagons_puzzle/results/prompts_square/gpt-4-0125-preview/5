Finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 within a spiral pattern involves identifying a pattern or formula for how the numbers increase as they spiral outward.

First, it's essential to note how the numbers grow in such a spiral. Let's briefly break down the pattern using layers and squares:

1. The center of the spiral starts at 1, which is in its own "layer."
2. Each layer surrounds the previous layers and includes increasingly larger squares of numbers. The first square around the center (1) is 3x3, the next is 5x5, then 7x7, and so on, increasing by 2 for each layer. This pattern creates a series of odd squares: \(1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2\), etc.

The key to solving the problem without writing out or visualizing the entire spiral is to recognize that squares of odd numbers are turning points in the spiral. Specifically, these odd squares mark the southeast corners of each layer:

- \(1 = 1^2\)
- \(9 = 3^2\)
- \(25 = 5^2\)
- \(49 = 7^2\)
- Etc.

Now, to find the position of 2026, we first identify the nearest odd square less than or equal to 2026. 

The square roots of numbers in this range will give us an indication of where 2026 fits:

- \(\sqrt{2026}\) is approximately 45, meaning it's beyond \(45^2 = 2025\) but hasn't reached \(47^2 = 2209\).

So, 2026 is just after \(2025\), which is \(45^2\), on the spiral. It means 2026 is one step into the layer that goes up to \(47^2\).

The neighbors of 2026 in the spiral pattern would be in positions relative to it. However, given its unique position just after \(2025\), its neighbors' values are determined by their proximity to 2025 and 2026:

**Directly due to the spiral's nature and the placement of 2026:**
- The value immediately before it (2025) would be to the left. *(directly part of the square of 45\(^2\))*
- The values incrementing after 2026 continue the outward spiral.

Given that 2026 is at the start of a new layer (a corner if you will), its neighbors would include:
- **To the left (the previous number in sequence):** 2025
- **Surrounding it:** Since 2026 is at the very edge and only has 2025 directly identifiable without extensive calculation, the rest of the neighbors are part of an outer square that has not fully formed in the sequence yet. 

**However, solving directly for the sum of the neighbors:**

Normally, for a complete understanding of the specific sum, you would need more information or a specific formula related to the positions of numbers in the spiral.

Based on the approach I took, giving an exact numeric sum of the neighbors without walking through the entire spiral arrangement or having a predetermined formula that relates a number's position to its neighbors' values in this pattern is challenging. 

In a typical math pattern or puzzle, you'd need to either derive or know a direct formula for finding neighbors in such a spatial configuration. In practical terms, this specific sum isn't directly calculable with just the logic provided; it requires acknowledging how the spiral grows and applying or deriving a formula that connects the position of 2026 within that spiral to the values around it, which entails more detailed spatial and numerical analysis than what's covered here.
