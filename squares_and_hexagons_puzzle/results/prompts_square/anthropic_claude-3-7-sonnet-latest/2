# Finding the Sum of Neighbors of 2026 in the Spiral

I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral grid and calculate their sum. First, I'll determine the position of 2026, then identify its neighbors.

## Finding the Position of 2026

The spiral follows this pattern:
```
17 16 15 14 13
18  5  4  3 12
19  6  1  2 11
20  7  8  9 10
21 22 23 24 25
```

To find the position of a number in this spiral:
1. Determine which "layer" or "ring" it's in
2. Figure out its exact position in that ring

The outer layer boundaries are perfect squares: 1, 9, 25, 49... or generally (2k+1)² where k is the layer number (with 0 being the center).

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer k contains 2026 if (2k-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)²
- Testing k = 22: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025 < 2026
- Testing k = 23: (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209 > 2026

So 2026 is in layer 22, and specifically it's the first number after the perfect square 2025.

For the first number after a perfect square (2k+1)², its position is at coordinates (k+1, k), which for 2026 means (23, 22) from the center.

## Finding the Neighbors

From position (23, 22), the 8 neighbors are at:
- (22, 21): 2026 - 45 - 1 = 1980
- (23, 21): 2026 - 1 = 2025
- (24, 21): 2026 + 45 - 1 = 2070
- (22, 22): 2026 - 1 = 2025
- (24, 22): 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (22, 23): 2026 - 1 + 45 = 2070
- (23, 23): 2026 + 45 = 2071
- (24, 23): 2026 + 1 + 45 = 2072

## Sum of Neighbors

The sum of all 8 neighbors is:
1980 + 2025 + 2070 + 2025 + 2027 + 2070 + 2071 + 2072 = 16,340
