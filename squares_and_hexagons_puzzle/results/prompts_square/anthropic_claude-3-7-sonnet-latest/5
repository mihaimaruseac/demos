I'll solve this by identifying the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid and summing them.

First, I need to understand the spiral pattern better. Looking at the given example:
- The spiral starts with 1 in the center
- It moves right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, etc.

To find the position of 2026 and its neighbors, I need to analyze the spiral structure.

For a number n in this spiral:
- Numbers that complete a full layer are perfect odd squares: 1, 9, 25, 49...
- The bottom-right corner of each layer contains these squares
- Each layer forms a square with side length = 2k+1 for layer k

Let me determine which layer contains 2026:
- Layer 0 has 1 (just the center)
- Layer 1 has numbers 2-9
- Layer 2 has numbers 10-25
- Layer k contains (2k+1)² - (2k-1)² = 8k numbers

For 2026, I can solve: (2k-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)²
This gives me layer k = 22, as 43² = 1849 < 2026 ≤ 45² = 2025

Actually, 2026 is just after a perfect square (2025 = 45²), which means it's the first number in layer 23, and it's positioned just to the right of the bottom-right corner.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (to the right)
- 1981 (above)
- 2071 (below)
- 1980 (above-left diagonal)
- 1982 (above-right diagonal)
- 2070 (below-left diagonal)
- 2072 (below-right diagonal)

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2071 + 1980 + 1982 + 2070 + 2072 = 16,208
