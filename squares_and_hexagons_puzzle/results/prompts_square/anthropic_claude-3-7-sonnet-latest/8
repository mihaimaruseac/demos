I need to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid, then calculate their sum.

First, let me determine where 2026 is located in the spiral. I'll analyze the pattern:

The spiral starts with 1 in the center, then:
- 2-9 form the first "ring" (8 numbers)
- 10-25 form the second "ring" (16 numbers)
- 26-49 form the third "ring" (24 numbers)

In general, the nth ring contains 8n numbers, starting from (n-1)²+1 and ending at n².

To locate 2026, I need to determine which ring it belongs to. If the nth ring ends at n², then:
- I need to find n where n² ≥ 2026 > (n-1)²
- 45² = 2025 and 46² = 2116
- So 2026 belongs to the 46th ring, positioned just after the corner value 2025

Since 2026 is the number right after a perfect square (2025 = 45²), it's located at the beginning of the 46th ring, immediately after turning the corner. In the spiral pattern, this means 2026 is directly to the right of 2025.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 would be:
- To the left: 2025
- To the right: 2027
- Above: the number from the 45th ring
- Below: the number from the 47th ring
- And the four diagonal neighbors

Working out these values:
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Above: 2026 - (2×46-1) = 2026 - 91 = 1935
- Below: 2026 + (2×46+1) = 2026 + 93 = 2119
- Upper-left diagonal: 1935 - 1 = 1934
- Upper-right diagonal: 1935 + 1 = 1936
- Lower-left diagonal: 2119 - 1 = 2118
- Lower-right diagonal: 2119 + 1 = 2120

The sum of all 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 1935 + 2119 + 1934 + 1936 + 2118 + 2120 = 16,214
