To solve this problem, I need to find the positions of the 8 neighbors surrounding the number 2026 in the spiral grid, and then determine what numbers occupy those positions.

I'll analyze how the spiral works:
1. The spiral starts with 1 at the center
2. It moves right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4 and 5, down to 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.

First, I need to locate 2026 in the spiral. To do this, I'll find which "layer" or "ring" it's in.

The spiral layers contain these counts of numbers:
- Layer 0 (center): 1 number
- Layer 1: 8 numbers (2-9)
- Layer 2: 16 numbers (10-25)
- Layer n: 8n numbers

The last number in layer n is (2n+1)² = 4n²+4n+1

To find which layer contains 2026:
- For n=22: last number is 4(22)²+4(22)+1 = 1937
- For n=23: last number is 4(23)²+4(23)+1 = 2117

So 2026 is in layer 23, between 1937 and 2117.

In layer 23, the spiral:
- Starts at 1938 on the right side
- Then goes up the right side
- Then left across the top
- Then down the left side
- Then right across the bottom

For layer 23, each side has 2×23=46 numbers. Let me determine where 2026 falls:
- Right side: 1938 to 1983 (46 numbers)
- Top side: 1984 to 2029 (46 numbers)

So 2026 is on the top side, 2026-1984+1 = 43 positions from the start of the top side, meaning it's near the end of the top row of this layer.

Now I can identify all 8 neighbors of 2026:
- Right: 2027 (next in the spiral)
- Left: 2025 (previous in the spiral)
- Below: 1933 (one layer in, same relative position)
- Above: 2119 (one layer out, same relative position)
- Upper right: 2028 (diagonal)
- Upper left: 2118 (diagonal)
- Lower right: 1934 (diagonal)
- Lower left: 1932 (diagonal)

The sum of all neighbors is:
2027 + 2025 + 1933 + 2119 + 2028 + 2118 + 1934 + 1932 = 16,116
