I need to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral of natural numbers laid out on a square grid.

To solve this problem, I'll:
1. Determine the position of 2026 in the spiral
2. Find all 8 neighboring numbers
3. Calculate their sum

First, I'll analyze the pattern of the spiral:
- The spiral starts with 1 at the center
- It moves right, then up, then left, then down, and continues in this pattern
- The numbers increase by 1 at each step

Let me determine which "ring" or "layer" number 2026 is in:
- Layer 1: 1 (center)
- Layer 2: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 3: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer 4: 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Layer n: Contains 8(n-1) numbers

To find the layer containing 2026, I need to solve:
1 + 8(1+2+3+...+k) ≥ 2026
This means I need to find k where 1 + 4k(k+1) ≥ 2026

Using the quadratic formula, I get k ≈ 22.5
So 2026 is in the 23rd layer of the spiral.

The 22nd layer ends at 1 + 8(1+2+...+21) = 1 + 8(21×22/2) = 1 + 8×231 = 1 + 1848 = 1849

So the 23rd layer contains numbers from 1850 to 1849 + 8×23 = 1849 + 184 = 2033

Now I need to determine the exact position of 2026 within this layer. The 23rd layer has four sides with 23×2 numbers per side.

Analyzing the pattern, I determine that 2026 is located on the top side of the 23rd ring, specifically 23-1 = 22 positions to the left of the top-right corner.

With this position identified, I can determine all 8 neighbors:
- Top-left: 2025
- Top: 1869
- Top-right: 1870
- Right: 2027
- Bottom-right: 2183
- Bottom: 2182
- Bottom-left: 2181
- Left: 2026-1 = 2025

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is:
2025 + 1869 + 1870 + 2027 + 2183 + 2182 + 2181 + 2025 = 16,362
