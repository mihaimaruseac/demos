I need to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral. Let me map out exactly where 2026 is and identify its neighbors.

First, I'll analyze the pattern of the spiral:
- The spiral starts with 1 at the center
- It moves right (2), then up (3), then left (4, 5), then down (6, 7, 8), then right (9, 10, ...), continuing outward

To locate 2026, I need to determine which "layer" or "ring" of the spiral contains it. Each complete ring adds 8k numbers, where k is the ring number (with the center being ring 0).

Let me calculate this systematically:
- Ring 0: Contains just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: Contains 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: Contains 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: Contains 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring 4: Contains 50-81 (32 numbers)

Each ring k contains 8k numbers, and the last number in ring k is (2k+1)².

For the number 2026, I need to solve for k where:
(2k-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)²

This gives k = 22, placing 2026 in the 22nd ring.

The corners of the 22nd ring are:
- Bottom-right corner: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Bottom-left corner: 2025 - 22×2 = 1981
- Top-left corner: 1981 - 22×2 = 1937
- Top-right corner: 1937 - 22×2 = 1893

Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the number immediately after the bottom-right corner, meaning it's on the right edge of the spiral, one step up from the corner.

Given this position, the 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- To the left: 2027
- To the right: 2025
- Above: 2047
- Below: 2005
- Upper-left: 2048
- Upper-right: 2046
- Lower-left: 2006
- Lower-right: 2004

The sum of these 8 numbers is:
2027 + 2025 + 2047 + 2005 + 2048 + 2046 + 2006 + 2004 = 16,208
