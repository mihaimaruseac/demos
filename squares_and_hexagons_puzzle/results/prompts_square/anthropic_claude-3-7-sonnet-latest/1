I need to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid and calculate their sum.

First, I'll understand the pattern of the spiral. Looking at the example:
- Starting at 1 in the center
- Moving right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- And continuing outward in a counterclockwise spiral

To locate 2026 and its neighbors, I'll analyze the structure of this spiral:

1. The spiral forms concentric "rings" around 1
2. Each ring has a characteristic range of numbers
3. Within each ring, numbers follow predictable patterns on each side

Let me determine which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 8n numbers, with last number (2n+1)²

For ring n, the last number is (2n+1)², and I need to find n where (2n+1)² ≥ 2026.
Solving: n = 22 (since 45² = 2025 and 47² = 2209)

So 2026 is in ring 22, just after the corner number 2025 = 45².

The corners of ring 22 are:
- Bottom right: 45² = 2025
- Bottom left: 2025 - 44 = 1981
- Top left: 1981 - 44 = 1937
- Top right: 1937 - 44 = 1893

Since 2026 is one step after 2025, it's on the bottom side moving left. 

Now I can identify all 8 neighbors:
- Right: 2025 (corner)
- Top-right: 1980
- Top: 1979
- Top-left: 1978
- Left: 2027
- Bottom-left: 2070
- Bottom: 2069
- Bottom-right: 2068

The sum of these neighbors is:
2025 + 1980 + 1979 + 1978 + 2027 + 2070 + 2069 + 2068 = 16,196
