I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the number spiral and then calculate their sum.

First, let me analyze the pattern of the spiral:
- 1 is at the center
- The spiral moves: right (2), up (3), left (4, 5), down (6, 7, 8), right (9, 10, 11, 12), and continues outward

To find the position of 2026 and its neighbors, I'll determine which "layer" or "ring" of the spiral contains 2026.

Each complete layer forms a square ring with sides of length 2n+1 where n is the layer number (with the center being layer 0).

Layer 1: Contains numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
Layer 2: Contains numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
Layer k: Contains (2k+1)² - (2k-1)² = 8k numbers

To find 2026's layer, I need to solve:
1 + 8(1+2+...+k) ≥ 2026

This simplifies to: 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) ≥ 2026
Or: 1 + 4k(k+1) ≥ 2026
Or: 4k² + 4k + 1 ≥ 2026

Solving: k ≈ 22.5, so 2026 is in layer 23.

The last number in layer 22 is 1 + 8(1+2+...+22) = 1 + 8(22×23/2) = 1 + 8×253 = 1 + 2024 = 2025.

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in layer 23, which means it's at the position immediately to the right of 2025.

In the spiral pattern, the 8 neighbors of 2026 would be:
- Left: 2025
- Upper left diagonal: 2024
- Up: 2023
- Upper right diagonal: 2022
- Right: 2027
- Lower right diagonal: 2050
- Down: 2049
- Lower left diagonal: 2048

The sum of these neighbors is:
2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2027 + 2050 + 2049 + 2048 = 16,268
