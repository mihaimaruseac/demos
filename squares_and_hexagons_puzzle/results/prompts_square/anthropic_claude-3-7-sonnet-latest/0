I need to determine the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid and find their sum.

First, I'll analyze how numbers are placed in this spiral pattern:
- The spiral starts with 1 at the center
- It moves right (2), then up (3), left (4, 5), down (6, 7, 8), right (9, 10, 11, 12), and so on
- Each side of the spiral gets longer as we move outward

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to determine its position in the spiral.

Let me analyze what layer 2026 is in. Each complete layer forms a square ring:
- Layer 1: Numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: Numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer 3: Numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
- And so on, with layer n containing 8n numbers

The pattern for the last number in layer n is (2n+1)², so:
- Layer 1 ends with 3² = 9
- Layer 2 ends with 5² = 25
- Layer 3 ends with 7² = 49

Generally, layer n ends with (2n+1)² and starts with (2n-1)² + 1.

For 2026, I need to find n such that (2n-1)² + 1 ≤ 2026 ≤ (2n+1)².
Solving: √2026 ≈ 45, so n should be around 22-23.

Let's check layer 22:
- Ends with 45² = 2025
- Starts with 43² + 1 = 1850

So 2026 is in layer 23, which starts at 2026.

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it's positioned just after 2025, which is the bottom-right corner of layer 22. So 2026 is on the right edge, one step right from the bottom right corner.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
1. 2025 (to the left)
2. 2024 (diagonally up-left)
3. 2027 (below)
4. 2067 (diagonally down-left)
5. 2068 (down)
6. 2069 (diagonally down-right)
7. 2070 (to the right)
8. 2071 (diagonally up-right)

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2067 + 2068 + 2069 + 2070 + 2071 = 16,421
