I need to determine the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral grid, then find their sum.

To solve this problem, I'll:
1. Determine the location of 2026
2. Find the 8 adjacent numbers
3. Calculate their sum

First, I need to understand the pattern of the spiral. Looking at the given examples:
- 1 is at the center
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 spiral around 1 in a clockwise direction

Let me analyze the pattern to locate 2026:

The spiral forms complete squares. The outer layer of each square has these properties:
- Bottom right corner: perfect squares (1, 9, 25, 49, etc.)
- Each side of layer n has length 2n-1
- Each complete layer adds 8n numbers

For number 2026, I need to find which layer it's in and its position.

To find the layer, I need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 2026.
44² = 1936 and 45² = 2025
So 2026 is just after the bottom right corner (2025) of layer 45.

This means 2026 is at the start of the bottom side of layer 46, moving left from the bottom right corner.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- To the right: 2025 (bottom right corner of layer 45)
- To the left: 2027
- Above: 1981, 1982, 1983
- Below: 2069, 2070, 2071

Let me verify the above neighbors by checking the pattern:
- 2025 is the corner (45²)
- 2026 is one step left from corner
- Bottom edge of layer 46 starts at 2026 and continues left
- Right edge of layer 45 has 2025, 2024, ..., 1981 (moving up)
- Top edge of layer 46 would be 2070, 2071, ... (moving right)

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1982 + 1983 + 2069 + 2070 + 2071 = 16,208
