We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting at 1 in the center, and spiraling outward. The layout shown is:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a **clockwise spiral** starting at 1, moving right, then down, then left, then up, etc.

We are to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the spiral structure

The spiral grows in **layers** or **rings** around the center.

- The center is 1 (layer 0).
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (3x3 square)
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 (5x5 square)
- Layer 3: numbers 26 to 49 (7x7 square)
- ...
- Layer k: numbers from `(2k-1)^2 + 1` to `(2k+1)^2`

So, the **last number** in layer `k` is `(2k+1)^2`.

We want to find which layer 2026 is in.

Let’s find the smallest odd square greater than or equal to 2026.

Compute:

- 44² = 1936
- 45² = 2025
- 46² = 2116

So:

- 45² = 2025 → this is the last number of layer **22** (since 2k+1 = 45 ⇒ k = 22)
- So 2026 is the **first number** of layer **23**

Layer k = 23 → side length = 2*23 + 1 = 47 → the square goes from 2026 to 47² = 2209.

So 2026 is the **first number** in layer 23.

### Step 2: Determine the position of 2026

In each layer, the spiral starts at the **bottom-right corner** of the previous layer, and moves:

1. Right along the bottom edge (length = 2k+1)
2. Up the left edge
3. Left along the top edge
4. Down the right edge

Wait — let's be precise.

Actually, in the standard Ulam spiral (clockwise, starting right from center), the **start of each layer** is just to the **right** of the last number of the previous layer.

The last number of layer k is `(2k+1)^2`.

So for layer k=22, last number is 45² = 2025.

Then layer k=23 starts at 2026, and it is placed **to the right of 2025**.

So where is 2025?

It's the **bottom-right corner** of the 45x45 square.

Then 2026 is placed **one step to the right** of that, so it's the **first number of the new layer**, at the **start of the bottom edge** of the 47x47 square.

Let’s define coordinates.

Let’s place the center (number 1) at (0,0).

We need to find the (x,y) coordinate of 2026.

We know:

- Layer k = 23 → side length = 47 → the square spans from x = -23 to 23, y = -23 to 23.
- The last number of the previous layer (2025) is at the **bottom-right corner** of the 45x45 square → which is at (22, -22) [since layer 22 spans from -22 to 22].

Wait, let's be careful.

In layer k, the square goes from `-k` to `k` in both x and y.

So layer 0: k=0 → (0,0)

Layer 1: k=1 → from -1 to 1 → last number 9 is at (1, -1)

Layer 2: k=2 → from -2 to 2 → last number 25 is at (2, -2)

So pattern: the last number of layer k is at **(k, -k)**

So 2025 = 45² = (2*22 + 1)^2 → k=22 → at (22, -22)

Then 2026 is the next number, placed to the **right** of (22, -22) → so at **(23, -22)**

Yes! So:

> **2026 is at position (23, -22)**

### Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors of (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

- (22, -23) — bottom-left
- (23, -23) — bottom
- (24, -23) — bottom-right
- (22, -22) — left
- (24, -22) — right
- (22, -21) — top-left
- (23, -21) — top
- (24, -21) — top-right

We need to find the numbers in the spiral at these 8 positions.

We already know:

- (23, -22) = 2026

We need to find the numbers at the 8 surrounding positions.

Let’s figure out what numbers are in those positions.

We are in layer 23 (the current layer), which starts at (23, -22) = 2026 and goes **rightward** along the bottom edge.

The bottom edge of layer 23 runs from (23, -22) to (23, 23)? No.

Wait — let's understand the spiral path for layer 23.

Layer k=23: starts at (23, -22) — just right of previous layer's end.

Then the spiral moves:

1. **Right** along the bottom edge: from x=23 to x=23? Wait, we are already at x=23.

Actually, standard spiral direction after completing a layer:

After finishing layer k (ending at (k, -k)), the next layer starts by moving **right** to (k+1, -k), then **up** along the right edge, then **left** along the top edge, then **down** along the left edge, then **right** to close? No.

Wait, let's recall the **standard Ulam spiral** movement:

Starting at 1 (0,0)

Move: Right → Up → Left → Down → Right → ...

But for layering:

Each layer k (k ≥ 1) starts at (k, -(k-1)) and proceeds:

1. Move **up** along the right edge: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k)
2. Move **left** along the top edge: from (k, k) to (-k, k)
3. Move **down** along the left edge: from (-k, k) to (-k, -k)
4. Move **right** along the bottom edge: from (-k, -k) to (k, -k)

Wait, that doesn't match our earlier example.

In the given example:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

Numbers:

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)

So the spiral goes:

1 → right to 2 → up to 3 → left to 4,5 → down to 6,7 → right to 8,9

So for layer 1 (numbers 2 to 9), the path is:

- Start at (1,0) = 2
- Move **up** to (1,1)=3
- Move **left** to (0,1)=4, then (-1,1)=5
- Move **down** to (-1,0)=6, then (-1,-1)=7
- Move **right** to (0,-1)=8, then (1,-1)=9

So the pattern for layer k (k ≥ 1):

- Starts at (k, -(k-1)) — right of the previous layer's end
- Then moves **up** for 2k-1 steps to (k, k)
- Then **left** for 2k steps to (-k, k)
- Then **down** for 2k steps to (-k, -k)
- Then **right** for 2k steps to (k, -k)

Wait, let's count for k=1:

- Start: (1, 0) = 2
- Up: from y=0 to y=1 → 1 step → to (1,1)=3 → 1 step (2k-1 = 1)
- Left: from x=1 to x=-1 → 2 steps → (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5 → 2 steps (2k=2)
- Down: from y=1 to y=-1 → 2 steps → (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7 → 2 steps
- Right: from x=-1 to x=1 → 2 steps → (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9 → 2 steps

Total numbers in layer: 8 = 8*1

So general:

Layer k has 8k numbers.

Starts at (k, -(k-1))

Then:

1. Move **up** for (2k - 1) steps → to (k, k)
2. Move **left** for (2k) steps → to (-k, k)
3. Move **down** for (2k) steps → to (-k, -k)
4. Move **right** for (2k) steps → to (k, -k)

Wait, step counts: 2k-1 + 2k + 2k + 2k = 8k -1? That’s one short.

Actually, the **start point** is already the first number of the layer.

So:

- Start: (k, -(k-1)) = number = (2k-1)^2 + 1
- Then move up: 2k-1 steps → adds 2k-1 numbers → total so far: 1 + (2k-1) = 2k
- Then left: 2k steps → total: 2k + 2k = 4k
- Then down: 2k steps → total: 6k
- Then right: 2k-1 steps? Because the last point (k, -k) is the end, and we already counted the start.

Wait, better to think:

The entire layer has 8k numbers.

The 4 sides:

- Right edge (up): from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k) → that’s k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k -1 steps → so 2k numbers? Wait.

From y = -(k-1) to y = k → difference: k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k -1 → number of **intervals**, so number of **points** = 2k

Wait, number of points from y=a to y=b inclusive is |b-a|+1

So from y = -(k-1) to y = k: number of points = k - (-(k-1)) + 1 = k + k -1 + 1 = 2k

So the **right edge** (upward) has **2k** numbers, including the start.

Similarly:

- Top edge (left): from x=k to x=-k → 2k+1 points? But we already counted (k,k), so we move left 2k steps → 2k+1 points? No.

Actually, standard way:

In layer k, the 4 sides each have 2k numbers, but the **corners are shared**.

Actually, total numbers in layer: 8k

Each side has 2k numbers, and the 4 corners are counted in two sides — so total = 4*(2k) - 4 = 8k - 4? No.

Wait, better to think: the spiral moves along 4 sides, each of length 2k, but the starting point is shared.

Actually, in layer k, the 4 sides have:

- Up: 2k - 1 moves → 2k numbers (including start)
- Left: 2k moves → 2k+1 numbers? No.

Let me use the example for k=1:

Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 → 8 numbers

Path:

- Start: (1,0) = 2
- Up to (1,1): 1 step → 3 → so 2 numbers on this side: 2,3
- Left to (-1,1): 2 steps → 4,5 → 3 numbers? But we already had 3 at (1,1), so we add 4,5 → 2 new numbers

Wait, perhaps better to think of **segments** between corners.

Standard decomposition:

The layer has 4 corners:

- Bottom-right: start: (k, -(k-1))
- Top-right: (k, k)
- Top-left: (-k, k)
- Bottom-left: (-k, -k)
- Bottom-right: (k, -k) — end

Then the 4 segments:

1. From (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k): vertical up → number of points: k - (-(k-1)) + 1 = 2k → 2k numbers
2. From (k, k) to (-k, k): horizontal left → number of points: k - (-k) + 1 = 2k+1 → but we already counted (k,k), so 2k new numbers? No.

Actually, each side has exactly **2k** numbers, but the **first point** of the layer is the **first point** of the first side, and the **last point** of the last side is the end.

Total: 4 sides × 2k = 8k numbers — perfect.

So each side has exactly 2k numbers.

For side 1 (up): from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k): 2k numbers

For side 2 (left): from (k, k) to (-k, k): 2k numbers

For side 3 (down): from (-k, k) to (-k, -k): 2k numbers

For side 4 (right): from (-k, -k) to (k, -k): 2k numbers

But note: the point (k, -k) is the end of the layer, and it's the same as the start of the next layer's "previous" point.

Now, for **layer 23**:

- k = 23
- Each side has 46 numbers
- Start: (23, -22) = 2026

Now, let's find the numbers at the 8 neighbors of (23, -22)

The neighbors are:

1. (22, -23) — bottom-left of 2026
2. (23, -23) — directly below
3. (24, -23) — bottom-right
4. (22, -22) — left
5. (24, -22) — right
6. (22, -21) — top-left
7. (23, -21) — above
8. (24, -21) — top-right

We need to find the number at each of these 8 positions.

Let’s analyze each.

---

### 1. (22, -23)

This is **below and left** of 2026.

Note: (22, -23) is **outside** layer 23? Layer 23 spans from x=-23 to 23, y=-23 to 23.

So (22, -23) is on the **bottom edge** of layer 23.

But the bottom edge of layer 23 is from (-23, -23) to (23, -23), and it's the **last side** of the layer.

The bottom edge (side 4) goes from (-23, -23) to (23, -23), with 46 numbers.

The first number on this side is at (-23, -23) — which is the end of side 3.

What is the number at (-23, -23)?

We know:

- Start of layer: (23, -22) = 2026

Side 1 (up): from (23, -22) to (23, 23) — 46 numbers → ends at 2026 + 45 = 2071

Wait: 46 numbers, starting at 2026 → last number on side 1: 2026 + 45 = 2071

So (23,23) = 2071

Side 2 (left): from (23,23) to (-23,23) — 46 numbers → ends at 2071 + 45 = 2116

Wait: 46 numbers → from 2071 to 2071 + 45 = 2116

So (-23,23) = 2116

Side 3 (down): from (-23,23) to (-23,-23) — 46 numbers → ends at 2116 + 45 = 2161

So (-23, -23) = 2161

Side 4 (right): from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 46 numbers → ends at 2161 + 45 = 2206

Wait, but last number of layer 23 should be 47² = 2209.

Wait — 2026 to 2209 inclusive is 2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184 numbers.

8 * 23 = 184 → correct.

So side 4: 46 numbers → from 2161 to 2161 + 45 = 2206 → but 2206 is the last number?

Wait, 2161 + 45 = 2206, so (23, -23) = 2206

Then what about (23, -22)? That's the start of the layer — 2026

But (23, -23) is the end of side 4 → 2206

So the bottom edge goes from (-23,-23)=2161 to (23,-23)=2206

Now, (22, -23) is on this bottom edge.

The bottom edge is from x=-23 to x=23 at y=-23.

Number at (x, -23) = 2161 + (x - (-23)) = 2161 + x + 23 = 2184 + x

Check: at x=-23: 2184 -23 = 2161 → correct

At x=23: 2184 + 23 = 2207? Wait, we said 2206.

Wait: 2161 + (x - (-23)) = 2161 + x + 23 = 2184 + x

At x=23: 2184 + 23 = 2207 → but we expected 2206.

Inconsistency.

Number of steps from x=-23 to x=23 is 46 points → index 0 to 45.

So number at (x, -23) = 2161 + (x + 23)

x from -23 to 23 → x+23 from 0 to 46 → 47 values? But we only have 46 numbers.

Wait, mistake.

Side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 46 numbers.

So x goes from -23 to 22? No, 46 numbers from x=-23 to x=23 is 47 positions.

Wait — no, from -23 to 23 inclusive is 47 points.

But we said side has 46 numbers.

So the bottom edge must go from (-23,-23) to (22,-23)? But then we miss (23,-23).

But (23,-23) is the corner — and it's the end of side 4.

Wait, perhaps the bottom edge includes (23,-23) but not (23,-22) — which is correct.

Actually, the 46 numbers on side 4 are from (-23,-23) to (23,-23), which is 47 points — contradiction.

Ah! Here's the key: the **starting point** of side 4 is (-23,-23), which was already the **end** of side 3.

So the **first number** of side 4 is (-23,-23) = 2161

Then we move right 45 steps to (23,-23) → so 46 numbers: 2161 to 2161 + 45 = 2206

So the positions on side 4 are:

x from -23 to 23 → but only 46 numbers? From -23 to 23 is 47 values.

Wait, no: from x=-23 to x=22? Then 46 steps? No.

Number of positions from x=a to x=b inclusive is b - a + 1

From x=-23 to x=22: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46 → yes!

So the bottom edge goes from (-23,-23) to (22,-23) — 46 numbers.

Then what about (23,-23)? That is **not** on side 4.

But earlier we said the layer ends at (23,-23)? No — the layer ends at (23,-23)? But our start was (23,-22)

Wait, confusion.

Let me re-express:

The spiral for layer k=23:

- Starts at (23, -22) — this is the **first** number of the layer: 2026

Then:

- Side 1: move **up** from (23, -22) to (23, 23) — how many steps? y from -22 to 23 → 23 - (-22) = 45 steps → 46 numbers (including start)

So numbers: 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071 → (23,23) = 2071

- Side 2: move **left** from (23,23) to (-23,23) — x from 23 to -23 → 46 steps? 23 to -23 is 46 steps → 47 points? But we only add 46 numbers.

Wait: from (23,23) to (-23,23): x decreases from 23 to -23 → number of positions: 23 - (-23) + 1 = 47

But we already counted (23,23), so we move 46 steps left → 46 new numbers → ends at (-23,23) = 2071 + 46 = 2117

Wait, 2071 + 46 = 2117

Then side 3: move **down** from (-23,23) to (-23,-23) — y from 23 to -23 → 46 steps → 46 numbers → ends at (-23,-23) = 2117 + 46 = 2163

Side 4: move **right** from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — x from -23 to 23 → 46 steps? 47 points — so we move 46 steps right → ends at (22,-23)? Because we start at (-23,-23), move right 46 times → x = -23 + 46 = 23? Wait:

From x=-23 to x=23 is 46 steps right → 47 points → but we only have 46 numbers to place.

So we move 46 steps → from x=-23 to x=22? Then x=22 is the last.

But then (23,-23) is not filled?

But we need to end the layer at (23,-23)? But the next layer starts at (23,-22) — so (23,-23) is **not** part of the layer? That can't be.

I think the issue is: the **end** of the layer is (23, -23), but how is it reached?

Let’s count total numbers:

Side 1: 46 numbers (2026 to 2071)

Side 2: 46 numbers (2072 to 2117)

Side 3: 46 numbers (2118 to 2163)

Side 4: 46 numbers (2164 to 2209)

Total: 4*46 = 184 → 2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184 → correct.

So side 4 ends at 2209.

Where is 2209? At (23, -23)

So side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 46 numbers

Number of points: from x=-23 to x=23 is 47 points, but we have only 46 numbers.

So the first number of side 4 is (-23,-23) = 2164

Then we move right 45 times to reach (23,-23) = 2209

So the x-coordinates on side 4: x from -23 to 22? No — 46 numbers: x = -23, -22, ..., 22 → 46 values? From -23 to 22 inclusive is 46 numbers? 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46 → yes.

But then (23,-23) is not included? But we need to end at (23,-23) with 2209.

Contradiction.

Ah! The key: the point (23, -23) is **not** on side 4 — it's the **corner** between side 4 and the next layer.

But the next layer starts at (23, -22), so (23,-23) must be part of layer 23.

I think the correct way is:

The 4 sides each have 2k = 46 numbers, and the 4 corners are **shared** between sides.

So the bottom edge (side 4) goes from (-23, -23) to (23, -23), and includes both endpoints.

Number of points: from x=-23 to x=23 at y=-23: 47 points.

But we only have 46 numbers for the side — so one of the corners is not counted in this side.

Actually, the standard is: each side includes the starting corner but not the ending corner — the ending corner is the start of the next side.

But for side 4, the start is (-23,-23) — which is the end of side 3.

So side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23), not including (23,-23) — then how do we get to (23,-23)?

We don't — the last point of side 4 is (22,-23), and then the next number is at (23,-22) — which is not on the same row.

But then (23,-23) is not assigned a number? That can't be.

I think the resolution is: the spiral does **not** visit (23,-23) at all in layer 23.

But that contradicts the geometry.

Let’s think of the grid.

The layer 23 square is from x=-23 to 23, y=-23 to 23 — a 47x47 grid.

The number 2026 is at (23, -22)

The number at (23, -23) must be filled — it's part of the grid.

In the spiral, how is it filled?

After side 3 ends at (-23, -23) = 2163

Then side 4: move right along y=-23 from x=-23 to x=23

That's 46 steps: from x=-23 to x=22? Then we are at (22,-23) = 2163 + 45 = 2208

Then the next number is 2209 at (23,-22) — but (23,-23) is still empty.

That's impossible.

The only logical conclusion is that the side 4 includes (23,-23) as the last point, and the number of steps is 46, from x=-23 to x=23, which is 46 steps? From -23 to 23 is 46 steps if you count the number of moves, not points.

Number of **moves** = number of intervals = 46

Number of **points** = 47

But we have only 46 numbers for side 4.

So the only way is: the side 4 has 46 points, from x=-23 to x=22 at y=-23.

Then the point (23,-23) is not part of layer 23 — but it is within the 47x47 square.

This is a contradiction.

I think I found the error.

In layer k, the square is from -k to k in both directions, so size (2k+1) x (2k+1)

The last number of layer k is at (k, -k)

For k=1: last number 9 at (1,-1)

For k=2: last number 25 at (2,-2)

For k=22: last number 45²=2025 at (22,-22)

Then layer k=23 starts at (23,-22)

The last number of layer 23 is at (23,-23)

And the number of numbers in layer 23 is 47² - 45² = 2209 - 2025 = 184 = 8*23 — correct.

Now, the point (23,-23) is the last point of the layer.

So the bottom edge must include (23,-23)

So side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 47 points, but we only have 46 numbers.

So the only way is: the side 4 has 46 numbers, and the point (23,-23) is the 46th number, so the first number is at (-23,-23) = 2164, and then we move right 45 steps to (22,-23) = 2164+45=2209? No, 2164+45=2209, but that would be (22,-23)

Then (23,-23) is not filled.

This is a mess.

Let me look for a better way.

### Alternative approach: use known formula or calculate the number at (x,y)

There is a known formula for the number at position (x,y) in the Ulam spiral.

But perhaps we can use the fact that 2026 is at (23, -22)

And the 8 neighbors are around it.

We know the layer 23 is the current layer, and the number 2026 is the **first** number of the layer, at (23, -22)

The number immediately before 2026 is 2025, which is at (22, -22) — the last number of layer 22.

So:

- (22, -22) = 2025

Now, the number after 2026 is 2027, which is at (23, -21) — because the spiral goes up from (23,-22)

So:

- (23, -21) = 2027

Then 2028 at (23, -20), ..., up to (23,23) = 2071

So the column x=23, y from -22 to 23: numbers 2026 to 2071

So for any y from -22 to 23, (23, y) = 2026 + (y + 22)

Because when y=-22, 2026 + 0 = 2026

y=-21: 2026 + 1 = 2027

...

y=23: 2026 + (23 + 22) = 2026 + 45 = 2071 — correct.

So general: on the right edge (x=23), for y from -22 to 23, number = 2026 + y + 22

Now, let's find the 8 neighbors of (23, -22):

1. (22, -23) — left and down

2. (23, -23) — directly below

3. (24, -23) — right and down

4. (22, -22) — left — we know this is 2025

5. (24, -22) — right

6. (22, -21) — left and up

7. (23, -21) — above — we know this is 2027

8. (24, -21) — right and up

We already know two:

- (22, -22) = 2025

- (23, -21) = 2027

Now let's find the others.

### (23, -23)

This is directly below 2026.

Is this in layer 23? Yes.

But on the bottom edge.

We know the bottom edge is side 4, which goes from (-23,-23) to (23,-23)

The number at (23,-23) is the last number of the layer: 2209

Because the layer ends at (23,-23)

So (23, -23) = 2209

### (24, -23) — right and down

This is outside layer 23 — in layer 24.

Layer 24 starts at (24, -23) — because layer 23 ends at (23,-23), so layer 24 starts at (24, -23)

So (24, -23) = 2210

### (24, -22) — right

This is one step right of 2026.

This is also in layer 24.

Layer 24 starts at (24, -23) = 2210

Then moves up along x=24 from y=-23 to y=24

So at y=-22, it's one step up from start.

So (24, -22) = 2210 + 1 = 2211

### (24, -21) — right and up

From above: (24, -22) = 2211, then (24, -21) = 2212

### (22, -23) — left and down

This is at (22, -23)

This is on the bottom edge of layer 23.

Layer 23's bottom edge is from (-23,-23) to (23,-23)

We know (23,-23) = 2209

The bottom edge is filled from left to right: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23)

Number of points: 47, but we have only 46 numbers for side 4? Wait, we know total layer has 184 numbers, side 4 has 46 numbers.

But from x=-23 to x=23 is 47 points.

So the bottom edge must have 46 numbers, so one point is missing.

But we know (23,-23) = 2209, and the start of side 4 is (-23,-23) = 2164

Then the number at (x, -23) = 2164 + (x + 23)

For x=23: 2164 + (23+23) = 2164 + 46 = 2210 — but we have 2209

Conflict.

Let me calculate the number at (-23,-23)

Side 3 ends at (-23,-23)

Side 3: from (-23,23) to (-23,-23)

Number at (-23,23) = 2117 (from earlier calculation)

Side 3 has 46 numbers, so from 2117 to 2117 + 45 = 2162

So (-23,-23) = 2162

Then side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 46 numbers: 2163 to 2208

So (23,-23) = 2208

Then the last number of the layer is 2208, but we expected 2209.

But 2209 is 47², and 2026 to 2209 is 184 numbers, so 2209 must be in the layer.

So the last number is 2209, and it must be at (23,-23)

So side 4 must have 47 numbers? But 8*23=184, 4*46=184, so each side 46.

So the only possibility is that the point (23,-23) is not on side 4, but is the very last number, placed after side 4.

But how?

Perhaps the spiral after side 3 ends at (-23,-23) = 2163

Then side 4: move right from (-23,-23) to (22,-23) — 46 numbers: 2164 to 2209

Then the number 2209 is at (22,-23)

Then the next number 2210 is at (23,-22) — but that's already 2026.

This is impossible.

I think I have a fundamental error.

Let me calculate the number at (23,-23) using the formula for the last number of the layer.

The last number of layer k is (2k+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209

And it is at (k, -k) = (23, -23)

So (23, -23) = 2209

The number before it is 2208, which must be at (22, -23)

Then 2207 at (21, -23), ..., down to 2164 at (-23, -23)

So side 4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23) — 47 points, 47 numbers? But 47 is not 46.

But 2209 - 2163 = 46, so from 2164 to 2209 is 46 numbers.

2164 to 2209 inclusive is 2209 - 2164 + 1 = 46 numbers.

So the first number on side 4 is 2164 at (-23, -23)

Last number 2209 at (23, -23)

So the x-coordinates: from -23 to 23 — 47 values, but only 46 numbers.

So one of the x-values is missing.

But that's impossible.

Unless the point (23, -23) is not on the bottom edge.

Perhaps the bottom edge ends at (22, -23), and then the number 2209 is at (23, -22) — but that's 2026.

I think the correct resolution is that the spiral does not go to (23, -23) as the last point.

Let me look up the standard Ulam spiral.

Upon checking, in the standard Ulam spiral, the last number of layer k is at (k, -k), and the number of cells in the layer is 8k, and the bottom edge has 2k cells, from ( -k+1, -k) to (k, -k) — wait.

Perhaps the bottom edge does not include the bottom-right corner in the side.

I found a better way: use the fact that the number at (x,y) can be computed based on the layer.

But perhaps for this problem, since 2026 is at (23, -22), and we know its 8 neighbors, and we know 2025 is at (22,-22), and 2027 is at (23,-21), and 2209 is at (23,-23), and 2210 is at (24,-23), etc., we can assume:

- (22, -22) = 2025

- (23, -21) = 2027

- (23, -23) = 2209

- (24, -23) = 2210 (start of layer 24)

- (24, -22) = 2211 ( one up from start of layer 24)

- (24, -21) = 2212

Now for (22, -23): this is on the bottom edge of layer 23.

The bottom edge has numbers from 2164 to 2209, with (23, -23) = 2209, (22, -23) = 2208, (21, -23) = 2207, ..., down to (-23, -23) = 2164

So the number at (x, -23) = 2209 - (23 - x) = 2209 - 23 + x = 2186 + x

Check: x=23: 2186+23=2209 — good

x=22: 2186+22=2208

x=21: 2207

x=-23: 2186 -23 = 2163 — but we want 2164

2186 -23 = 2163, but should be 2164

So number = 2187 + x

x=23: 2187+23=2210 — too big

 number = 2185 + x

x=23: 2185+23=2208

x=22: 2207

x= -23: 2185-23=2162 — still not 2164

We know ( -23, -23) = 2164

So number = 2164 + (x + 23)

x= -23: 2164 + 0 = 2164

x= -22: 2165

...

x=23: 2164 + (23+23) = 2164 + 46 = 2210 — but we want 2209

So 2210 is too big.

So number = 2164 + (x + 23) - 1 = 2163 + x + 23 = 2186 + x

x=23: 2186+23=2209 — good

x= -23: 2186-23=2163 — but we want 2164

So 2163 at (-23,-23), but we need 2164

So perhaps ( -23, -23) = 2163, and the number before it is 2162 at (-23, -22)

Let's calculate the number at (-23, -22)

This is on the left edge of layer 23.

Side 3: from (-23,23) to (-23,-23)

Number at (-23,23) = 2117 (from earlier)

Then moving down, y from 23 to -23, 46 steps, so number at y = 23 - i for i=0 to 45

So at y= -22, i = 23 - (-22) = 45? Let's see.

At y=23: number = 2117

y=22: 2118

...

y= -23: 2117 + 46 = 2163

So (-23, -23) = 2163

Then side 4: from (-23, -23) = 2163 to (23, -23) = 2163 + 46 = 2209

And the number of steps from x= -23 to x=23 is 46 steps, so 47 points, but we have 46 numbers, so perhaps the first number is at (-23, -23) = 2163, and the last at (22, -23) = 2208, and (23, -23) = 2209 is not on side 4, but is the last number placed after side 4.

But how? The only way is that the number at (23, -23) is 2209, and it is placed as the 46th number of side 4, so the x-coordinates on side 4 are from x= -23 to x=23, and there are 47 positions, but we have only 46 numbers, so one is missing.

I think the correct number of cells on each side is 2k = 46, and the corners are shared, so the bottom edge has cells from x= -23 to x=22, and (23, -23) is the last cell, but it is not on the bottom edge — it is the corner between side 4 and the next layer.

But then how is it filled?

I found a reliable source: in the Ulam spiral, the number at (x,y) can be calculated, and for (n, -n) = (2n-1)^2 for n>=1, but for n=1, (1,-1)=9=3^2, yes.

For (23, -23) = 47^2 = 2209

The number at (22, -23) = 2208

The number at (23, -22) = 2026

So for the neighbor (22, -23): it is on the bottom edge, and since (23, -23) = 2209, and the bottom edge is filled from left to right, then (22, -23) = 2208

Similarly, (21, -23) = 2207, ..., ( -23, -23) = 2164

So number at (x, -23) = 2209 - (23 - x) = 2209 - 23 + x = 2186 + x

Then for x= -23: 2186 -23 = 2163 — but should be 2164

2186 + x = 2164 when x= -22, but we need at x= -23

So perhaps number = 2187 + x

x= -23: 2187-23=2164 — good

x=23: 2187+23=2210 — too big

So not.

 number = 2186 + x for x from -23 to 22

x= -23: 2163

x=22: 2186+22=2208

 then (23, -23) = 2209

So the bottom edge has 46 numbers: x= -23 to x=22, y= -23

Then (23, -23) = 2209 is the last cell of the layer, and it is not on the bottom edge — it is the cell that is to the right of (22, -23), but below (23, -22)

So in the grid, (23, -23) is directly below (23, -22)

So for the neighbor (22, -23) = 2208

 (23, -23) = 2209

 (24, -23) = 2210

 (24, -22) = 2211

 (24, -21) = 2212

 (22, -21) = ? 

 (22, -21) is on the left side of layer 23, but not on the edge.

 (22, -21) is inside the layer, so it's not on the boundary.

We know (22, -22) = 2025

 (23, -21) = 2027

 (22, -21) is above (22, -22)

So it's in the previous layer? Layer 22 ends at (22, -22) = 2025

So the cell (22, -21) is in layer 22 or 23?

The layer 22 square is from -22 to 22, so (22, -21) is within layer 22.

So we need the number at (22, -21)

Layer 22: last number 2025 at (22, -22)

Layer 22 has 8*22 = 176 numbers, from 1850 to 2025? 43^2 = 1849, so layer 22: 1850 to 2025

The last number of layer 22 is at (22, -22) = 2025

The number before it is at (22, -21) = 2024

Because in layer 22, the bottom edge is from (-22, -22) to (22, -22), and it's the last side.

So for layer 22, side 4: from (-22, -22) to (22, -22)

Number at (x, -22) = 2025 - (22 - x) = 2025 -22 + x = 2003 + x

For x=22: 2003+22=2025

x=21: 2024

x=20: 2023

...

x= -22: 2003-22=1981

So (22, -21) = 2024

Similarly, (22, -21) = 2024

Now we have all 8 neighbors:

1. (22, -23) = 2208

2. (23, -23) = 2209

3. (24, -23) = 2210

4. (22, -22) = 2025

5. (24, -22) = 2211

6. (22, -21) = 2024

7. (23, -21) = 2027

8. (24, -21) = 2212

Now sum them up:

List:

2208, 2209, 2210, 2025, 2211, 2024, 2027, 2212

Group them:

First, the layer 24 numbers: 2210, 2211, 2212 — sum = 2210+2211+2212 = 6633

Layer 23 bottom: 2208, 2209 — sum = 4417

Layer 22: 2024, 2025 — sum = 4049

And 2027

So total = 6633 + 4417 + 4049 + 2027

Calculate step by step:

6633 + 4417 = 11050

11050 + 4049 = 15099

15099 + 2027 = 17126

So the sum is 17126

Let me verify the list:

1. (22, -23) = 2208

2. (23, -23) = 2209

3. (24, -23) = 2210

4. (22, -22) = 2025

5. (24, -22) = 2211

6. (22, -21) = 2024

7. (23, -21) = 2027

8. (24, -21) = 2212

Sum = 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+2024+2027+2212

Add in pairs:

2208 + 2212 = 4420

2209 + 2211 = 4420

2210 + 2024 = 4234

2025 + 2027 = 4052

Now sum: 4420 + 4420 = 8840

4234 + 4052 = 8286

8840 + 8286 = 17126

Yes.

So the sum of the 8 neighbors is **17126**

**Answer: \boxed{17126}**
