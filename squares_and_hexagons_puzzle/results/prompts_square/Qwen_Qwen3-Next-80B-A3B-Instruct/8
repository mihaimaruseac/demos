We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting at 1 in the center, and spiraling outward. The example shows:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a **clockwise spiral** starting at the center with 1, moving right → up → left → down → right, etc.

We are to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the spiral structure

The spiral is built in **layers** or **rings** around the center.

- The center (layer 0) is just 1.
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (a 3x3 square)
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 (a 5x5 square)
- Layer k: numbers from `(2k-1)^2 + 1` to `(2k+1)^2`

In general:

- The **last number** in layer `k` is `(2k + 1)^2`
- The **first number** in layer `k` is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`
- The side length of the square at layer `k` is `2k + 1`

We need to find which layer 2026 is in.

---

### Step 2: Find which layer 2026 is in

We want to find the smallest integer `k` such that `(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`

Let’s compute some squares:

- `43^2 = 1849`
- `45^2 = 2025`
- `47^2 = 2209`

So:

- `45^2 = 2025` → so 2025 is the last number of layer `k` where `2k + 1 = 45` → `k = 22`
- Then layer `k = 23` starts at `2026` and ends at `47^2 = 2209`

Thus, **2026 is the first number in layer 23**.

So 2026 is at the **start of layer 23**, which means it is located at the **rightmost position of the bottom row** of the 47x47 square? Wait — let's think carefully.

Actually, in the spiral, each layer starts just to the **right** of the top-right corner of the previous layer.

Let me recall the spiral pattern.

Standard Ulam spiral:

- Start at 1 (center)
- Move right to 2
- Move up to 3
- Move left to 4, 5
- Move down to 6, 7
- Move right to 8, 9
- Then next layer: right to 10, up to 11,12,13, left to 14,15,16,17, down to 18,19,20,21, right to 22,23,24,25

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of **directions** and **positions**.

But here’s a better method:

In the standard Ulam spiral, the **last number** of layer `k` is `(2k+1)^2`, and it is located at the **bottom-right corner** of the square of side `2k+1`.

The spiral moves **clockwise**, starting from the center:

- Start at (0,0) = 1
- Move right → (1,0) = 2
- Move up → (1,1) = 3
- Move left → (0,1), (-1,1) = 4,5
- Move down → (-1,0), (-1,-1) = 6,7
- Move right → (0,-1), (1,-1), (2,-1) = 8,9,10
- Move up → (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) = 11,12,13
- Move left → (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2) = 14,15,16,17
- Move down → (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2) = 18,19,20,21
- Move right → (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), (3,-2) = 22,23,24,25,26

Wait — this is getting messy. Let's use a known fact:

> In the Ulam spiral, the numbers on the **bottom-right diagonal** are the **odd squares**: 1, 9, 25, 49, ..., i.e., `(2k+1)^2`

So:

- 1 = 1² → (0,0)
- 9 = 3² → bottom-right of 3x3 square
- 25 = 5² → bottom-right of 5x5 square
- 49 = 7² → bottom-right of 7x7
- ...
- 2025 = 45² → bottom-right corner of 45x45 square

So 2025 is at the **bottom-right corner** of the 45x45 square.

Then the next number, **2026**, is the **first number of the next layer**, which is the 47x47 square.

Where does the spiral go after 2025?

After finishing the 45x45 square at the bottom-right corner (2025), the next move is **right** one step to start the next layer.

So:

- 2025 is at position (22, -22) — if center is (0,0), and the 45x45 square extends from x = -22 to 22, y = -22 to 22.

Wait: side length = 45 → from -22 to +22 inclusive → 45 positions.

So bottom-right corner is (22, -22)

Then the next move is **right** → to (23, -22) → that’s where 2026 is placed.

So:

> **2026 is at position (23, -22)**

Now we need to find the **8 neighbors** of (23, -22), i.e., the 8 surrounding cells:

All positions (x±1, y±1) and (x±1, y), (x, y±1)

So neighbors are:

- (22, -23) — down-left
- (23, -23) — down
- (24, -23) — down-right
- (22, -22) — left
- (24, -22) — right
- (22, -21) — up-left
- (23, -21) — up
- (24, -21) — up-right

We need to find the numbers in these 8 positions.

---

### Step 3: Find the numbers in those 8 neighbor positions

We know that 2026 is at (23, -22)

We need to find the numbers at the 8 surrounding positions.

Note: The entire grid is filled with the spiral, so we can compute the number at any coordinate.

But computing 8 numbers directly might be tedious. However, we can use the fact that the spiral is built in layers, and we know the structure of the **current layer** (layer 23, side 47) and the **previous layer** (layer 22, side 45).

Let’s analyze the structure of the spiral layer by layer.

Each layer `k` (starting at k=0) has side length `s = 2k+1`

Layer `k` starts at `start_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1` and ends at `end_k = (2k+1)^2`

For k=23:

- start = (45)^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026
- end = (47)^2 = 2209

The layer has 4 sides, each of length `s - 1 = 46` (since corners are shared)

So total numbers in layer: `4 * 46 = 184`, and 2209 - 2025 = 184 → checks out.

The 4 sides of layer 23 (47x47) are traversed in order:

1. **Right edge**: from (22, -22) to (23, -22) → **start of layer** at (23, -22) = 2026
   - Then move **up** along the right edge: x=23, y from -22 to 23
   - So: up: y increases from -22 to 22 (since 23 is the max x, and y goes from -22 to 22? Wait, the square is from -23 to 23 in both x and y? Wait no.

Wait: side length 47 → coordinates from -23 to +23 inclusive → 47 values.

So the 47x47 square has x from -23 to 23, y from -23 to 23.

The previous layer (45x45) went from -22 to 22.

So the new layer extends one unit out in all directions.

The spiral path for layer 23:

- Start at (22, -22) → then move **right** to (23, -22) → that’s 2026
- Then move **up** along x=23, from y=-22 to y=23 → that’s 46 steps: y from -22 to 23 → 46 numbers (2026 to 2026+45=2071)
- Then move **left** along y=23, from x=23 to x=-23 → 47 steps? Wait: from x=23 to x=-23 is 47 positions? But we already placed (23,23) at the end of the up move.

Wait — let's be precise.

Standard Ulam spiral layer traversal:

After finishing the inner square (45x45) at (22, -22) = 2025, the next move is:

- Move **right** to (23, -22) → 2026
- Then move **up** along the right edge: from (23, -22) to (23, 23) → that’s 23 - (-22) = 45 steps? Wait: from y=-22 to y=23 is 46 values: -22, -21, ..., 23 → that’s 46 numbers.

Wait: number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.

From y = -22 to y = 23: 23 - (-22) + 1 = 46 numbers.

But we already placed the first one (2026) at (23, -22), so we add 45 more to reach (23,23).

So:

- (23, -22) = 2026
- (23, -21) = 2027
- ...
- (23, 23) = 2026 + 45 = 2071

Then next: move **left** along top edge: from (22,23) to (-23,23)

We are at (23,23) = 2071

Move left: x decreases from 22 to -23 → how many steps?

x from 22 down to -23: 22 - (-23) = 45 steps? Number of positions: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46? But we already have (23,23), so we move to (22,23), (21,23), ..., (-23,23)

Number of cells: from x=22 to x=-23 → 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46 cells, but we already placed (23,23), so we are placing 46 new numbers? But we only have 46 numbers per side? Wait, each side has 46 numbers (since 47x47, each side has 47 cells, but corners are shared).

Actually, each side of the square has **46** new numbers, because the corner is shared with the previous side.

So:

- Right edge: 46 numbers: from (23,-22) to (23,23) → 2026 to 2071
- Top edge: from (22,23) to (-23,23) → 46 numbers: 2072 to 2117
- Left edge: from (-23,22) to (-23,-23) → 46 numbers: 2118 to 2163
- Bottom edge: from (-22,-23) to (22,-23) → 46 numbers: 2164 to 2209

Wait — let’s check total: 4 * 46 = 184, and 2209 - 2025 = 184 → correct.

So:

- Right edge: y from -22 to 23, x=23 → 2026 to 2071
- Top edge: x from 22 down to -23, y=23 → 2072 to 2117
- Left edge: y from 22 down to -23, x=-23 → 2118 to 2163
- Bottom edge: x from -22 to 22, y=-23 → 2164 to 2209

Now we need the 8 neighbors of (23, -22) = 2026

List the 8 neighbors again:

1. (22, -23) — left-down
2. (23, -23) — down
3. (24, -23) — right-down
4. (22, -22) — left
5. (24, -22) — right
6. (22, -21) — left-up
7. (23, -21) — up
8. (24, -21) — right-up

Now let's find the number at each.

---

### Find each neighbor’s number

We know:

- 2026 is at (23, -22)

#### 1. (22, -23) — left-down

This is on the **bottom edge** of the current layer (layer 23), since y=-23.

Bottom edge: y=-23, x from -22 to 22 → numbers 2164 to 2209

So x from -22 to 22 → total 45 positions? Wait: from -22 to 22 inclusive is 45 numbers? 22 - (-22) + 1 = 45 → yes.

But bottom edge has 46 numbers? Contradiction.

Wait — earlier we said bottom edge: from (-22, -23) to (22, -23) → that’s 45 positions? But we said 46 numbers.

Wait, we must have made a mistake.

Let me recast.

The layer has 4 sides, each of length = 46 (since 47x47, each side has 47 cells, but each corner is shared, so each side contributes 46 new numbers).

So:

- Right edge: from (23, -22) to (23, 23): y from -22 to 23 → 46 values → 2026 to 2071
- Top edge: from (22, 23) to (-23, 23): x from 22 down to -23 → number of steps: 22 - (-23) = 45 → but number of positions: 46? From x=22 to x=-23 inclusive: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46 → yes.

Similarly, bottom edge: from (-22, -23) to (22, -23): x from -22 to 22 → 22 - (-22) + 1 = 45 positions → only 45? That’s a problem.

Wait — we have a discrepancy.

Actually, the bottom edge should go from **(-23, -23)** to **(23, -23)**? But we started the layer at (23, -22), then went up to (23,23), then left to (-23,23), then down to (-23,-23), then right to (23,-23).

Ah! I see the mistake.

After the left edge ends at (-23, -23), then we move **right** along the bottom edge from (-23, -23) to (23, -23)

So bottom edge: x from -23 to 23, y=-23 → 47 positions.

But the corner (-23, -23) is already placed at the end of the left edge.

So the bottom edge should have **46 new numbers**: from (-22, -23) to (23, -23)

Wait — let's think.

The left edge ends at (-23, -23) = 2163

Then we move right along y=-23: next cell is (-22, -23) = 2164, then (-21, -23), ..., up to (23, -23) = ?

From x=-22 to x=23: that’s 23 - (-22) + 1 = 46 numbers → so 2164 to 2209 → yes, 2209 - 2163 = 46 → 2209 = 2163 + 46 → correct.

So bottom edge: x from -22 to 23, y=-23 → 46 numbers: 2164 to 2209

So the bottom edge does **not** include (-23, -23) — that was already placed at the end of the left edge.

Similarly, the right edge starts at (23, -22), not (23, -23)

So now, back to our neighbor positions.

We need to find:

1. **(22, -23)** — this is on the **bottom edge**, y=-23, x=22

Bottom edge: x from -22 to 23, y=-23 → numbers 2164 to 2209

x = -22 → 2164

x = -21 → 2165

...

x = 22 → ?

Number of steps from x=-22 to x=22: 22 - (-22) = 44 → so index = 44 → number = 2164 + 44 = **2208**

So (22, -23) = 2208

2. **(23, -23)** — this is the **bottom-right corner** of the layer.

We just said bottom edge ends at (23, -23) = 2209

Yes! So (23, -23) = 2209

3. **(24, -23)** — this is **outside** the current layer (layer 23 ends at x=23, y=23). So this is in the **next layer**? No — next layer is layer 24, which starts at 2210.

But (24, -23) is outside the 47x47 square. So it’s not yet filled? But the spiral hasn’t reached there yet.

Wait — we need to think: **all numbers are filled in the spiral**, so (24, -23) must be part of a later layer.

But we are only concerned with the **current grid** — the spiral is infinite, so all positions have numbers.

We need to find what number is at (24, -23)

This is in **layer 24**.

Layer 24: side length = 49, from x=-24 to 24, y=-24 to 24

Start of layer 24: 47² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210

The spiral after 2209 (at (23, -23)) moves **down** one step to (23, -24) = 2210? Wait, no.

After completing layer 23 at (23, -23) = 2209, the next move is **down** to start layer 24.

So:

- 2209 at (23, -23)
- Move down to (23, -24) = 2210
- Then move left along bottom edge of layer 24: from (22, -24) to (-24, -24)
- Then up along left edge, etc.

So (24, -23) is **not** on the path of layer 24.

Let’s think: what is the position (24, -23)?

It is to the **right** of (23, -23), and one above (24, -24)

So it’s on the **right edge** of layer 24.

Layer 24: right edge: x=24, y from -24 to 24

Start of layer 24: (23, -23) = 2209 → move down to (23, -24) = 2210

Then move left to (-24, -24) = 2210 + 47 - 1? Wait.

Right edge of layer 24: from (24, -24) to (24, 24)

But how is it reached?

After bottom edge of layer 24 ends at (-24, -24), then we move up along left edge: from (-24, -23) to (-24, 24)

Then move right along top edge: from (-23, 24) to (24, 24)

Then move down along right edge: from (24, 23) to (24, -24)

Wait — this is messy.

Alternative: we can find the number at (24, -23) by realizing it's on the **right edge** of layer 24.

Layer 24 starts at 2210.

The right edge of layer 24 is traversed **last**, from (24, 23) down to (24, -24)

Number of cells on right edge: from y=23 down to y=-24 → 23 - (-24) + 1 = 48? But layer 24 has side 49, so each side has 48 new numbers.

Total numbers in layer 24: 4 * 48 = 192, and 49² - 47² = (49-47)(49+47) = 2*96 = 192 → yes.

The right edge is the **last** side of the layer.

Order of sides for layer 24:

1. Start at (23, -23) = 2209
2. Move down to (23, -24) = 2210 — this is the first cell of layer 24
3. Move left along bottom: from (22, -24) to (-24, -24) → 48 numbers: 2210 to 2257
4. Move up along left edge: from (-24, -23) to (-24, 24) → 48 numbers: 2258 to 2305
5. Move right along top edge: from (-23, 24) to (24, 24) → 48 numbers: 2306 to 2353
6. Move down along right edge: from (24, 23) to (24, -24) → 48 numbers: 2354 to 2401

So the right edge goes from (24,23) down to (24,-24)

So (24, -23) is the **second-to-last** cell on the right edge.

The right edge starts at (24,23) = 2354

Then (24,22) = 2355

...

Down to (24, -24) = 2401

So y from 23 down to -24: 48 steps.

So for a given y, the number at (24, y) is:

Start at y=23: 2354

Then each step down decreases y by 1, increases number by 1.

So number = 2354 + (23 - y)

Check: at y=23: 2354 + 0 = 2354

At y=-24: 2354 + (23 - (-24)) = 2354 + 47 = 2401 → correct.

So for (24, -23):

number = 2354 + (23 - (-23)) = 2354 + 46 = **2400**

So (24, -23) = 2400

4. **(22, -22)** — this is inside the previous layer (layer 22)

Layer 22: side 45, from x=-22 to 22, y=-22 to 22

We need to find the number at (22, -22)

This is the **bottom-right corner** of layer 22 → which is the last number of layer 22.

Layer 22 ends at (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45² = 2025

So (22, -22) = 2025

5. **(24, -22)** — this is one unit to the right of 2026.

We are at (23, -22) = 2026

(24, -22) is to the right — same y, x+1

This is in layer 23? Layer 23 has x from -23 to 23, so x=24 is outside.

So (24, -22) is in layer 24.

Is it on the top edge? Or right edge?

Layer 24: top edge is y=24, right edge is x=24.

(24, -22) is on the **right edge** of layer 24? Yes, x=24, y=-22

From above, right edge of layer 24: (24, y) for y from 23 down to -24

So (24, -22) is on that edge.

Number = 2354 + (23 - (-22)) = 2354 + 45 = **2399**

6. **(22, -21)** — this is inside layer 22 or 23?

(22, -21): x=22, y=-21

Layer 22: max x=22, max y=22 → so (22, -21) is inside layer 22.

We need to find what number is at (22, -21)

This is on the **right edge** of layer 22.

Layer 22: side 45, ends at 2025 at (22, -22)

Layer 22: right edge: from (22, -21) to (22, 22)

Wait — layer 22 starts at (21, -21) = (2*21 +1)^2 + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850

Then:

- Right edge: from (22, -21) to (22, 22) → y from -21 to 22 → 44 numbers? Let's not guess.

We know the last number of layer 22 is 2025 at (22, -22)

The spiral before that: after placing (22, -22), it would have come from above.

Actually, the right edge of layer 22 goes from (22, -21) up to (22, 22)

So the numbers on the right edge of layer 22: from (22, -21) = first of right edge to (22, 22) = last of right edge

Number of cells: from y=-21 to y=22 → 22 - (-21) + 1 = 44

So 44 numbers.

The right edge is the **first** side of layer 22.

Layer 22 starts at (21, -21) = 1850

Then:

- Move right to (22, -21) = 1851
- Then up to (22, 22) = 1851 + 43 = 1894? Wait: from y=-21 to y=22 is 44 positions, so 1851 to 1894

Then move left along top edge: (21,22) to (-22,22) → 44 numbers: 1895 to 1938

Then down left edge: (-22,21) to (-22,-22) → 44 numbers: 1939 to 1982

Then right along bottom: (-21,-22) to (21,-22) → 44 numbers: 1983 to 2025

Wait — but (22, -22) is the last number, and it's not on the bottom edge? Contradiction.

Actually, the bottom edge ends at (22, -22)

So the bottom edge should go from (-22, -22) to (22, -22)

So the right edge must end at (22, 22), and the bottom edge starts at (22, -22)? No — the spiral is continuous.

Standard order: after bottom edge, you go to right edge? No.

Let me recall the direction:

After layer 21 ends at (21, -21) = 1849

Then layer 22:

- Move right to (22, -21) = 1850
- Move up to (22, 22) = 1850 + 43 = 1893? (y from -21 to 22: 44 values, so 1850 to 1893)
- Move left to (-22, 22) = 1893 + 44 = 1937
- Move down to (-22, -22) = 1937 + 44 = 1981
- Move right to (22, -22) = 1981 + 44 = 2025

Yes! So (22, -22) = 2025

And the right edge: from (22, -21) to (22, 22): numbers 1850 to 1893

So (22, -21) = 1850

But we want (22, -21) — that's the **first** number of the right edge → 1850

So (22, -21) = 1850

7. **(23, -21)** — this is directly above 2026

We know (23, -22) = 2026

Then moving up: (23, -21) = 2027 (first step up the right edge of layer 23)

Yes! Because layer 23 right edge: (23, -22)=2026, (23,-21)=2027, ..., up to (23,23)=2071

So (23, -21) = 2027

8. **(24, -21)** — this is to the right of 2027

x=24, y=-21

Again, outside layer 23, so in layer 24.

On the right edge of layer 24: x=24, y from 23 down to -24

So (24, -21) = 2354 + (23 - (-21)) = 2354 + 44 = **2398**

### Now, list all 8 neighbors and their numbers:

1. (22, -23) = 2208  
2. (23, -23) = 2209  
3. (24, -23) = 2400  
4. (22, -22) = 2025  
5. (24, -22) = 2399  
6. (22, -21) = 1850  
7. (23, -21) = 2027  
8. (24, -21) = 2398  

Now sum them:

Let’s add step by step:

Group them:

- 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
- 2400 + 2399 = 4799  
- 2025 + 1850 = 3875  
- 2027 + 2398 = 4425  

Now sum those:

4417 + 4799 = 9216  
3875 + 4425 = 8300  
Total = 9216 + 8300 = **17516**

Wait, let me check:

Better to add all:

List:

2208  
2209  
2400  
2025  
2399  
1850  
2027  
2398  

Add in order:

Start with 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
4417 + 2400 = 6817  
6817 + 2025 = 8842  
8842 + 2399 = 11241  
11241 + 1850 = 13091  
13091 + 2027 = 15118  
15118 + 2398 = **17516**

So the sum is **17516**
