We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting at 1 in the center, and spiraling outward. The pattern shown is:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a **clockwise spiral** starting at 1, moving right → up → left → down → right, etc.

We are to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the spiral structure

The spiral grows in layers (concentric squares). The center is layer 0: just 1.

Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 → 8 numbers → 3×3 square  
Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 → 16 numbers → 5×5 square  
Layer 3: numbers 26 to 49 → 24 numbers → 7×7 square  
...

In general, layer **k** (k ≥ 1) has side length **2k+1**, and contains **8k** numbers.

The last number in layer k is the square of the side length:  
**Last number in layer k = (2k+1)²**

So, to find which layer 2026 is in, we solve:

Find smallest k such that (2k+1)² ≥ 2026

Compute:

- k=1: 3²=9  
- k=2: 5²=25  
- k=3: 7²=49  
- k=4: 9²=81  
- k=5: 11²=121  
- k=6: 13²=169  
- k=7: 15²=225  
- k=8: 17²=289  
- k=9: 19²=361  
- k=10: 21²=441  
- k=11: 23²=529  
- k=12: 25²=625  
- k=13: 27²=729  
- k=14: 29²=841  
- k=15: 31²=961  
- k=16: 33²=1089  
- k=17: 35²=1225  
- k=18: 37²=1369  
- k=19: 39²=1521  
- k=20: 41²=1681  
- k=21: 43²=1849  
- k=22: 45²=2025  
- k=23: 47²=2209 ← **> 2026**

So:

- Layer 22 ends at 45² = 2025  
- So **2026 is the first number in layer 23**

Layer 23 has side length = 2×23 + 1 = **47**

So the spiral goes from 2026 to 47² = 2209 in layer 23.

---

### Step 2: Determine position of 2026

Since layer 23 starts at 2026, and the spiral moves **right** from the end of the previous layer.

In a clockwise spiral, after completing layer k (ending at (2k+1)²), the next layer (k+1) starts by moving **right one step** from the top-right corner of the previous square.

The last number of layer 22 is 2025, which is at the **top-right corner** of the 45×45 square.

Then, the next number, 2026, is placed **one step to the right** of that corner.

So, the grid positions: Let’s assign coordinates with (0,0) at the center (number 1).

Then the top-right corner of layer 22 (45×45) is at position:

- The square goes from -22 to +22 in both x and y (since side length 45 → radius 22)
- So top-right corner is at (22, 22) → value 2025

Then 2026 is placed at (23, 22) — one step right.

So:

> **2026 is at (23, 22)**

---

### Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors of (23, 22)

The 8 neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

```
(22,21) (23,21) (24,21)
(22,22) (23,22) (24,22)
(22,23) (23,23) (24,23)
```

We need the numbers at these 8 positions.

We know that 2026 is at (23,22), and it’s the **first number of layer 23**.

Layer 23 starts at (23,22), and then proceeds **upward** along the right edge of the 47×47 square.

Let’s recall the spiral path for layer 23:

- Start at (23,22) → 2026  
- Then move **up** along x=23, y from 22 to 23 → y increases? Wait, let's be careful.

Actually, in the standard clockwise spiral, after finishing the previous layer at top-right corner (22,22), the next move is **right** to (23,22) → that’s the start of the new layer.

Then, the spiral goes **up** along the right edge: increasing y.

Wait — in the standard Ulam spiral, the direction sequence is:

**Right → Up → Left → Down → Right → ...**

So after placing 2025 at (22,22) (top-right of layer 22), the next move is **right** to (23,22) → 2026

Then, the next direction is **up** (increasing y), along the right edge.

So from (23,22), we move up to (23,23), (23,24), ..., up to (23,23) to (23,23) — wait, the top side of the 47×47 square goes from y=-23 to y=23.

So the right edge is x=23, y from -23 to 23.

But we start at (23,22), then move **up** to (23,23) → that’s the top-right corner.

So:

- 2026: (23,22)  
- 2027: (23,23) ← top-right corner of layer 23  
- Then we turn left (west), moving left along the top edge: x from 23 down to -23, y=23  
- Then down along left edge: x=-23, y from 23 down to -23  
- Then right along bottom edge: y=-23, x from -23 to 23  
- Then up along right edge? Wait — we already did the right edge.

Wait, actually, the layer has 4 sides:

- Right edge: from (23,22) to (23,23) → 2 numbers? No, wait.

Wait, let's think carefully.

In layer k, the side length is 2k+1, and each side has **2k** numbers, because the corners are shared.

Wait, total numbers in layer k: 8k

Each side has 2k numbers, but the 4 corners are shared between two sides, so each side has 2k numbers including both endpoints? Actually, standard is:

Each side has **2k** numbers, but the **first** number of the side is the **corner**, and the last number is the next corner.

So for layer 23 (k=23), each side has 2×23 = **46 numbers**

Wait, but that can't be, because 4×46 = 184, but 8×23 = 184 — yes.

So each side has 46 numbers.

But the **first** number of the layer is at (23,22), and then we move **up** along the right edge.

Wait — if the side has 46 numbers, and we start at (23,22), then moving up to (23,23) is only 1 step. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's clarify.

Actually, the side length is 47, so from bottom to top along the right edge, there are 47 positions: y from -23 to +23.

But the **side** of the square has 47 positions, but the **layer** only adds the outermost ring.

The previous layer (22) ended at (22,22), which is the top-right corner of the 45×45 square.

Then, the new layer (23) adds the next ring.

The **right edge** of the 47×47 square goes from (23, -23) to (23, 23) — that's 47 positions.

But the previous layer ended at (22,22), so the first step is to move right to (23,22) — which is the **second-highest** point on the right edge.

Wait, that suggests we are not starting at the bottom.

Actually, in the standard Ulam spiral, the spiral goes:

Start at (0,0)=1

Move right to (1,0)=2  
Move up to (1,1)=3  
Move left to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5  
Move down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7  
Move right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, (2,-1)=10, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the standard Ulam spiral direction.

But from the example given:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

So:

- 1 at center (0,0)  
- 2 to the right: (1,0)  
- 3 above 2: (1,1)  
- 4 left of 3: (0,1)  
- 5 left of 4: (-1,1)  
- 6 below 5: (-1,0)  
- 7 below 6: (-1,-1)  
- 8 right of 7: (0,-1)  
- 9 right of 8: (1,-1)

So direction sequence: Right → Up → Left → Down → Right → ...

And the spiral expands in rings.

The pattern is: after completing a square, the next layer starts by moving **right** from the top-right corner of the previous square.

So for layer 1: ends at 9 = 3² at (1,-1)

Then layer 2 starts at (2,-1) = 10

Then moves up: (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13

Then left: (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17

Then down: (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21

Then right: (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25

So the last number of layer 2 is 25 = 5² at (2,-2)

So general pattern:

- Layer k ends at (k, -k) with value (2k+1)²  
- Layer k+1 starts at (k+1, -k)

Wait, in layer 1 (k=1): ends at (1,-1)=9  
Layer 2 (k=2): starts at (2,-1)=10 → yes

So for layer k, it ends at (k, -k)

Then layer k+1 starts at (k+1, -k)

So for layer 22: ends at (22, -22) with value 45² = 2025

Then layer 23 starts at (23, -22) with value 2026

Ah! So I made a mistake earlier.

The top-right corner of layer 22 is (22,22), but the **last number** of layer 22 is **not** at (22,22) — it's at the **bottom-right** corner: (22, -22)

Because in the spiral, the last number of each layer is at the bottom-right corner.

So:

- Layer 1 ends at (1,-1)=9  
- Layer 2 ends at (2,-2)=25  
- Layer 3 ends at (3,-3)=49  
- ...  
- Layer 22 ends at (22,-22)=2025  
- Layer 23 starts at (23,-22)=2026

Then the direction is: **up** along the right edge.

So from (23,-22), we move up to (23,-21), (23,-20), ..., up to (23,23)

How many steps? From y=-22 to y=23 → that's 46 steps? Let's see:

y: -22, -21, ..., 23 → total numbers: 23 - (-22) + 1 = 46

Yes! So the right edge has 46 numbers: from 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071

So:

- 2026: (23, -22)  
- 2027: (23, -21)  
- ...  
- 2071: (23, 23) ← top-right corner

Then we turn left and move along the top edge: x from 23 down to -23, y=23

That’s 46 numbers: from 2072 to 2072+45=2117

So:

- 2072: (22,23)  
- 2073: (21,23)  
- ...  
- 2117: (-23,23)

Then down along left edge: x=-23, y from 23 down to -23 → 46 numbers

- 2118: (-23,22)  
- ...  
- 2163: (-23,-23)

Then right along bottom edge: y=-23, x from -23 to 23 → 46 numbers

- 2164: (-22,-23)  
- ...  
- 2209: (23,-23)

So now, we need the 8 neighbors of 2026, which is at **(23, -22)**

Let’s list the 8 neighbors:

```
(22, -23)  (23, -23)  (24, -23)
(22, -22)  (23, -22)  (24, -22)
(22, -21)  (23, -21)  (24, -21)
```

We need the numbers at these 8 positions.

We know 2026 is at (23, -22)

Let’s find the values at each neighbor.

---

### Find values of neighbors:

We know the spiral values in layer 23:

- Right edge: x=23, y from -22 to 23 → numbers 2026 to 2071

So:

- (23, -22) = 2026  
- (23, -21) = 2027  
- (23, 23) = 2071

Top edge: y=23, x from 22 down to -23 → numbers 2072 to 2117

So:

- (22,23) = 2072  
- (21,23) = 2073  
- ...  
- (-23,23) = 2117

Left edge: x=-23, y from 22 down to -23 → numbers 2118 to 2163

So:

- (-23,22) = 2118  
- (-23,21) = 2119  
- ...  
- (-23,-23) = 2163

Bottom edge: y=-23, x from -22 to 23 → numbers 2164 to 2209

So:

- (-22,-23) = 2164  
- (-21,-23) = 2165  
- ...  
- (23,-23) = 2209

Now, let’s find each neighbor of (23,-22):

1. **(22, -23)**: on bottom edge, y=-23, x=22

   Bottom edge: y=-23, x from -22 to 23 → 46 numbers: 2164 to 2209

   x from -22 to 23 → total 46 positions

   So index: x = -22 → 2164  
   x = -21 → 2165  
   ...  
   x = 23 → 2209

   So for x = 22: position = 22 - (-22) = 44 → 2164 + 44 = **2208**

   So (22,-23) = 2208

2. **(23, -23)**: bottom-right corner → last number of layer 23 → **2209**

3. **(24, -23)**: outside the current layer? Wait, layer 23 ends at x=23, y=23, etc.

   So (24,-23) is in layer 24 — we need to find what number is there.

   But we don't know layer 24 yet. But we can reason.

   Layer 24 starts after 2209.

   Layer 24 starts at (24, -23) — because layer k ends at (k, -k), so layer 23 ends at (23,-23)=2209

   Then layer 24 starts at (24, -23) = 2210

   So (24,-23) = 2210

4. **(22, -22)**: this is inside layer 22 — since layer 22 is 45×45, from -22 to 22 in both x and y.

   So (22,-22) is the **last number of layer 22** → 2025

5. **(24, -22)**: outside layer 23 — in layer 24

   Layer 24 starts at (24,-23)=2210, then moves up along x=24

   So next number after 2210 is (24,-22) = 2211

6. **(22, -21)**: inside layer 22? Let's see.

   (22,-21) is within x=±22, y=±22 → yes, inside layer 22.

   We need to find what number is at (22,-21) in layer 22.

   Layer 22 ends at (22,-22)=2025

   Layer 22 is a 45×45 square. The last number is at bottom-right corner (22,-22)

   The layer 22 spiral ends by going right along the bottom edge from (-22,-22) to (22,-22)

   So bottom edge of layer 22: y=-22, x from -22 to 22 → numbers from ??? to 2025

   How many numbers on bottom edge of layer 22? 44 numbers (since each side has 2*22=44 numbers)

   So bottom edge: starts at (-22,-22) = 1937? Wait, let's compute.

   Last number of layer 21: 43² = 1849

   So layer 22 starts at (22,-21) = 1850? Wait, no.

   General: layer k starts at (k, -(k-1))

   Layer 22 starts at (22, -21) = 1850

   Then moves up along x=22: from y=-21 to y=22 → 44 numbers: 1850 to 1893

   Then left along top: y=22, x=21 down to -22 → 44 numbers: 1894 to 1937

   Then down along left: x=-22, y=21 down to -22 → 44 numbers: 1938 to 1981

   Then right along bottom: y=-22, x=-21 to 22 → 44 numbers: 1982 to 2025

   So bottom edge of layer 22: y=-22, x from -21 to 22 → 44 numbers

   So (x, -22) for x from -21 to 22

   So (22,-22) = 2025  
   (21,-22) = 2024  
   (20,-22) = 2023  
   ...  
   (22 - n, -22) = 2025 - n

   So (22, -21) is **not** on bottom edge — it's on the right edge of layer 22.

   Right edge of layer 22: x=22, y from -21 to 22 → numbers 1850 to 1893

   So (22, -21) = 1850  
   (22, -20) = 1851  
   ...  
   (22, 22) = 1893

   So (22, -21) = 1850

   But we need (22, -21) — which is **above** (22,-22)

   So yes, (22, -21) is on the right edge of layer 22 → value = 1850 + ( -21 - (-21) )? Wait

   At y=-21 → first on right edge → 1850

   So (22, -21) = 1850

   But we need (22, -21) — which is one above (22,-22)

   So yes, (22, -21) = 1850

   Wait, but 2025 is at (22,-22), and 1850 is at (22,-21) — that’s a big jump. But that’s correct — the right edge is from y=-21 to y=22 → 44 numbers.

   So:

   - (22, -21) = 1850  
   - (22, -20) = 1851  
   - ...  
   - (22, 22) = 1893

   So (22, -21) = 1850

7. **(23, -21)**: this is on the right edge of layer 23 → 2027

   Because (23, -22)=2026, (23,-21)=2027

8. **(24, -21)**: outside layer 23 — layer 24

   Layer 24 starts at (24,-23)=2210

   Then moves up: (24,-22)=2211, (24,-21)=2212

   So (24,-21)=2212

---

### Now list all 8 neighbors and their values:

1. (22, -23) = 2208  
2. (23, -23) = 2209  
3. (24, -23) = 2210  
4. (22, -22) = 2025  
5. (24, -22) = 2211  
6. (22, -21) = 1850  
7. (23, -21) = 2027  
8. (24, -21) = 2212  

Now sum them:

Let’s add:

- 2208  
- 2209  
- 2210  
- 2025  
- 2211  
- 1850  
- 2027  
- 2212  

Group them:

First, the big ones: 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212 → that's 5 numbers

Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

This is an arithmetic series: 5 terms, average = 2210 → sum = 5 * 2210 = 11050

Then add: 2025 + 2027 = 4052

Then add 1850

Total = 11050 + 4052 + 1850

Compute:

11050 + 4052 = 15102  
15102 + 1850 = **16952**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **16952**

1. (22,-23) = 2208 — bottom edge, x=22 → 2209 -1 = 2208 ✔️  
2. (23,-23) = 2209 — end of layer 23 ✔️  
3. (24,-23) = 2210 — start of layer 24 ✔️  
4. (22,-22) = 2025 — end of layer 22 ✔️  
5. (24,-22) = 2211 — next after 2210 in layer 24 ✔️  
6. (22,-21) = 1850 — start of right edge of layer 22 ✔️

2025+2027=4052

Total: 11050 + 4052 = 15102; 15102 + 1850 = **16952**
