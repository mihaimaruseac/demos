We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting at 1 in the center, and spiraling outward. The example shows:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a **clockwise spiral**, starting at 1, moving right, then down, then left, then up, etc.

We are to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the spiral structure

The spiral is built in **layers** or **rings** around the center.

- Layer 0: just the center, number 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (3x3 square)
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 (5x5 square)
- Layer 3: numbers 26 to 49 (7x7 square)
- ...
- Layer k: numbers from `(2k-1)^2 + 1` to `(2k+1)^2`

So, the **last number** in layer `k` is `(2k+1)^2`.

We can find which layer 2026 is in by finding the smallest odd square ≥ 2026.

Let’s compute:

- 44² = 1936
- 45² = 2025
- 46² = 2116

So:

- 45² = 2025 → so 2025 is the last number of layer k where (2k+1) = 45 → 2k+1 = 45 → k = 22

So **layer 22** ends at 2025.

Thus, **2026 is the first number of layer 23**.

The next layer (layer 23) goes from **2026 to (2*23 + 1)² = 47² = 2209**

So 2026 is the **first number in layer 23**, which is a **47x47 square**.

Now, the spiral moves **right** from the end of the previous layer.

In the spiral pattern, each layer starts **one unit to the right** of the top-right corner of the previous layer.

Let’s recall the structure of how each layer is built.

Each layer `k` (starting from k=1) is a square of side length `2k+1`.

The **last number** of layer `k-1` is `(2k-1)^2`.

Then layer `k` starts at `(2k-1)^2 + 1`, and the spiral goes:

1. **Right** along the top edge (from the end of previous layer's top-right corner)
2. **Down** the right edge
3. **Left** along the bottom edge
4. **Up** the left edge

The **first number** of layer `k` is placed at position `(k, -(k-1))` if we consider the center (1) at (0,0).

But we don't need coordinates yet. Let’s think about **where 2026 is located**.

Since 2025 = 45² is the last number of layer 22, and layer 22 ends at the **top-right corner** of the 45x45 square.

So the next number, **2026**, is placed **one step to the right** of that top-right corner.

Therefore, **2026 is located at the top edge, just to the right of the previous layer's top-right corner**.

In terms of grid coordinates:

- Center (1) is at (0,0)
- The top-right corner of layer k is at (k, k)
- So layer 22 ends at (22, 22) with number 2025
- Then 2026 is at (23, 22) — one step right

Wait — let me verify the direction.

Actually, in the standard Ulam spiral, after finishing a layer (say, ending at top-right corner), you move **right** to start the next layer.

So if the last number of layer k is at (k, k), then the next number is at (k+1, k).

So for layer 22, ends at (22, 22) = 2025

Then 2026 is at **(23, 22)**

Then the spiral goes:

- Right along top edge: from (23,22) to (23,23) — but wait, no.

Actually, the top edge of layer 23 is from x = -23 to x = 23, y = 23? Let's think carefully.

Better approach: **Determine coordinates of 2026**

We know:

- Layer 22 ends at 2025, which is at the **top-right corner** of the 45x45 square → coordinates (22, 22)

Then we move **right** one step to start the next layer → so 2026 is at **(23, 22)**

Then the spiral goes:

- Move **up**? No — standard spiral after right is up? Wait, let's recall the direction sequence.

Standard Ulam spiral direction order:

Start at center (0,0) = 1

Then:

1. Right → (1,0) = 2
2. Up → (1,1) = 3
3. Left → (0,1) = 4, (-1,1) = 5
4. Left again? Wait, better to recall the pattern.

Actually, the spiral goes:

- Right, Up, Left, Down, and repeat, with step sizes increasing every two turns.

But a more reliable way is to note that **each layer starts at the point to the right of the previous layer’s top-right corner**.

So 2026 is at (23, 22)

Now, the layer 23 (47x47) has 4 sides, each of length 46 (since side length is 47, but corners are shared).

Actually, each side of the square has **2k** numbers, for layer k.

Wait, for layer k, the side length is 2k+1, so each side has 2k+1 numbers, but the 4 corners are shared.

So the number of numbers on each side **excluding corners** is (2k+1 - 2) = 2k - 1, and total numbers in layer: 4*(2k - 1) + 4 = 8k.

Wait, total numbers in layer k: (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = [4k² + 4k + 1] - [4k² - 4k + 1] = 8k

So yes, layer k has 8k numbers.

For layer 23: 8*23 = 184 numbers, from 2026 to 2209 (2209 - 2025 = 184 → correct)

Now, the 4 sides of layer 23:

Start at (23, 22) = 2026

Then we move **up** along the right side? No — wait.

Standard direction after finishing a layer (ending at top-right) is to go **right** to start the next layer, then **up**? No.

Wait, let's simulate small case.

Layer 1 (k=1): numbers 2 to 9

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0) → right
- 3 at (1,1) → up
- 4 at (0,1) → left
- 5 at (-1,1) → left
- 6 at (-1,0) → down
- 7 at (-1,-1) → down
- 8 at (0,-1) → right
- 9 at (1,-1) → right → then next layer starts at (2,-1)? But 10 is at (2,-1)? But in the example:

Given example:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

So 3 is at (1,1), 2 at (1,0), 1 at (0,0), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1)

So the spiral goes:

- 1: (0,0)
- 2: (1,0) → right
- 3: (1,1) → up
- 4: (0,1) → left
- 5: (-1,1) → left
- 6: (-1,0) → down
- 7: (-1,-1) → down
- 8: (0,-1) → right
- 9: (1,-1) → right

So the direction sequence is: right, up, left, left, down, down, right, right — but actually, it's:

- Right 1 → up 1 → left 2 → down 2 → right 2 → up 2 → left 3 → down 3 → ...

Wait, the step sizes increase every two directions.

Standard pattern:

- Move right 1 → up 1 → left 2 → down 2 → right 3 → up 3 → left 4 → down 4 → ...

So for layer k, we have two moves of length k.

Wait, layer 1: numbers 2-9 → 8 numbers → corresponds to moves: right1, up1, left2, down2 → total 6? Not matching.

Better to think in terms of **ring**.

The first ring (around 1) has numbers 2-9: 8 numbers → 8 = 4*2 → each side has 2 numbers? But 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.

From 1 to 2: right

Then:

- Up: 2→3 (1 step)
- Left: 3→4→5 (2 steps)
- Down: 5→6→7 (2 steps)
- Right: 7→8→9 (2 steps)

Wait, 7→8→9 is 2 steps? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1) → yes, 2 steps.

But from 1 to 2 is 1 step right.

So for ring 1 (numbers 2-9), the sides are:

- Right: 1 step (2)
- Up: 1 step (3)
- Left: 2 steps (4,5)
- Down: 2 steps (6,7)
- Right: 2 steps (8,9) — but we already did right once?

Actually, the pattern is:

- Start at center.
- For each ring n (n=1,2,3,...):
  - Move right n steps? No.

Standard algorithm for Ulam spiral:

Initialize: x=0, y=0, n=1, step=1

Then repeat:

- Move right step times
- Move up step times
- Move left step+1 times
- Move down step+1 times
- step += 2

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me use a known fact:

The number at position (x,y) in the Ulam spiral can be determined, but we need the reverse.

We know:

- 2025 = 45² → last number of layer 22 → at position (22, 22)

Then the next number, 2026, is placed one step to the **right** → (23, 22)

Then the spiral goes **up** along the right edge of the new square.

Wait, from (23,22), we move **up** to (23,23), (23,24), ..., up to (23,23) is only one step? No.

Wait, the new layer is a 47x47 square, so the top-right corner is at (23,23)

So from (23,22) — we are at the bottom of the right edge of the new square.

So the right edge of the new square goes from (23, -23) to (23, 23)

So we are at (23,22), which is just below the top-right corner.

So the next move is **up** to (23,23) — that's the top-right corner.

So:

- 2026: (23,22)
- 2027: (23,23) ← top-right corner

Then we turn left and move along the **top edge** to the left.

Top edge: from (23,23) to (-23,23) — that's 46 steps left.

So numbers 2028 to 2026 + 46 = 2072? Let's compute:

- 2026: (23,22)
- 2027: (23,23) ← 1 step up
- Then move left: 46 steps → 2028 to 2027 + 46 = 2073

So 2073 is at (-23,23) — top-left corner

Then move down: 46 steps → 2074 to 2073 + 46 = 2119

At (-23, -23) — bottom-left corner

Then move right: 46 steps → 2120 to 2119 + 46 = 2165

At (23, -23) — bottom-right corner

Then move up: 45 steps? Wait, we already did right from (23,22) to (23,23) — so the last side is from bottom-right to start? But we started at (23,22), so to close the loop, we need to go up from (23,-23) to (23,22) — that's 45 steps.

Wait, total numbers in layer: 184

Breakdown:

- Right edge (from (23,22) to (23,23)): 1 number → 2027 (2026 is start, so only one step up)
- Top edge: from (23,23) to (-23,23): 46 numbers → 2028 to 2073
- Left edge: from (-23,23) to (-23,-23): 46 numbers → 2074 to 2119
- Bottom edge: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23): 46 numbers → 2120 to 2165
- Then up from (23,-23) to (23,22): 45 numbers → 2166 to 2210? But 2209 is last.

Wait, 2026 to 2209 is 184 numbers.

Let’s count:

- 2026: start → position (23,22)
- Then 1 step up: 2027 → (23,23)
- Then 46 left: 2028–2073 → 46 numbers
- Then 46 down: 2074–2119 → 46
- Then 46 right: 2120–2165 → 46
- Then 45 up: 2166–2210? But 2209 is last.

Wait: 1 + 46 + 46 + 46 + 45 = 184? 1+46*3+45 = 1+138+45=184 → yes.

So:

- 2026: (23,22)
- 2027: (23,23)
- 2028–2073: top edge, y=23, x from 23 down to -23 → 46 numbers
- 2074–2119: left edge, x=-23, y from 23 down to -23 → 46 numbers
- 2120–2165: bottom edge, y=-23, x from -23 to 23 → 46 numbers
- 2166–2209: right edge, x=23, y from -23 up to 22 → 44 numbers? Wait 2209 - 2165 = 44 → 45 numbers? 2166 to 2209 is 44 numbers? 2209 - 2166 + 1 = 44 → but we need 45.

Wait: 2166 to 2209 inclusive: 2209 - 2166 + 1 = 44 → but we expected 45.

Mistake.

We have:

- 2026: 1 number
- 2027: 1 number (up)
- Then 3 sides of 46 each: 138
- Then up from (23,-23) to (23,22): how many steps?

From y=-23 to y=22 → that's 22 - (-23) = 45 steps → so 45 numbers.

So positions: y = -23, -22, ..., 22 → that's 46 values? No:

Number of integers from -23 to 22 inclusive: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46

But we are moving from (23,-23) to (23,22) — that's 45 moves, 46 positions.

But we already placed (23,-23) as the last of the bottom edge → 2165 is at (23,-23)

Then the next number, 2166, is at (23,-22), then 2167 at (23,-21), ..., up to (23,22)

So the last number on the right edge is at (23,22) — which is **2026**!

Wait — that's a problem.

We started at (23,22) with 2026, and now we're ending at (23,22) again? That can't be.

Ah! Here's the error.

The **right edge** of the new layer is from (23, -23) to (23, 23), but we already placed the top of it at 2027.

So the right edge has two parts:

- From (23,22) to (23,23): one step → 2026 to 2027
- From (23,-23) to (23,22): 45 steps → 2166 to 2210? But 2209 is last.

Wait, total positions on right edge: y from -23 to 23 → 47 positions.

But we already placed (23,23) at 2027, and (23,22) at 2026.

So the right edge has:

- (23,23): 2027
- (23,22): 2026 ← start
- Then we go down: (23,21), (23,20), ..., (23,-23)

So from (23,22) down to (23,-23): that's 22 - (-23) = 45 steps → 46 positions? But we already used (23,22) and (23,23)

Actually, the right edge has 47 points: y = -23 to 23.

We have:

- (23,23): 2027
- (23,22): 2026
- Then we move down: (23,21), ..., (23,-23): that's 22 - (-23) - 1? Let's count the numbers.

From y=22 down to y=-23: that's 22,21,...,-23 → number of integers: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46

But we already assigned 2026 to (23,22), and 2027 to (23,23). So the rest of the right edge is from y=21 down to y=-23: 21 to -23 → 21 - (-23) + 1 = 45 numbers.

So:

- 2026: (23,22)
- 2027: (23,23)
- 2028–2073: top edge (x from 22 down to -23, y=23) → 46 numbers
- 2074–2119: left edge (x=-23, y from 22 down to -23) → 46 numbers
- 2120–2165: bottom edge (x from -22 to 23, y=-23) → 46 numbers
- 2166–2209: right edge from (23,21) down to (23,-23) → 44 numbers? 2209 - 2166 + 1 = 44

Wait, 2166 to 2209 is 44 numbers, but we need 45 to complete the 47 on the right edge.

We have:

- (23,23): 2027
- (23,22): 2026
- (23,21) to (23,-23): 21 to -23 → 21 - (-23) + 1 = 45 positions → so 45 numbers: 2028? No, 2028 is on top.

Wait, we already used 2026 and 2027.

The right edge has 47 positions:

y: -23, -22, ..., 22, 23 → 47 values.

We have:

- 2026: (23,22)
- 2027: (23,23)
- Then we do top edge: 46 numbers → 2028 to 2073 → all at y=23, x from 22 down to -23
- Then left edge: 46 numbers → 2074 to 2119 → x=-23, y from 22 down to -23
- Then bottom edge: 46 numbers → 2120 to 2165 → y=-23, x from -22 to 23
- Now we need to fill the right edge from y=-22 up to y=21 → because y=22 and y=23 are already filled.

So the remaining on right edge: y from -22 to 21 inclusive.

That's 21 - (-22) + 1 = 44 numbers.

So 2166 to 2209: 44 numbers → 2209 - 2166 + 1 = 44 → correct.

So the right edge is fully covered:

- (23,23): 2027
- (23,22): 2026
- (23,21) to (23,-22): 2166 to 2209

So now, we know:

**2026 is at (23,22)**

We need the **8 neighbors** of (23,22)

The 8 neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

- (22,21), (23,21), (24,21)
- (22,22),         (24,22)
- (22,23), (23,23), (24,23)

So we need to find the numbers at these 8 positions.

We already know:

- (23,23) = 2027

What about the others?

We need to find the numbers at:

1. (22,21)
2. (23,21)
3. (24,21)
4. (22,22)
5. (24,22)
6. (22,23)
7. (23,23) = 2027
8. (24,23)

Let’s find each.

We know the structure of the spiral.

We know that layer 23 is from 2026 to 2209.

We know:

- (23,23) = 2027
- (23,22) = 2026

Now, (22,23): this is on the top edge, which is y=23, x from 23 down to -23.

The top edge starts at (23,23)=2027, then goes left to (22,23), (21,23), ..., (-23,23)

So the top edge has numbers:

- (23,23): 2027
- (22,23): 2028
- (21,23): 2029
- ...
- (-23,23): 2027 + 46 = 2073

So (22,23) = 2028

Similarly, (24,23): this is outside the current layer! It's at x=24, y=23 — which is in layer 24? But we are only up to layer 23.

Wait, the number at (24,23) is in the **next layer**, layer 24, which starts at 2210.

But we need the number at (24,23) — which is **not yet filled** in the spiral? No — the spiral is infinite, so we need to find what number is there.

Actually, the number at (24,23) is in the **previous layer**? No.

Let me think: the grid is filled in order. The number at (24,23) is not in layer 23 (which ends at 2209), so it must be in layer 24, which starts at 2210.

But how do we know what number is at (24,23)?

We need to find the number at each of the 8 neighbor positions.

Let’s find the numbers at each neighbor:

---

### 1. (23,23) = 2027 → already known

### 2. (22,23): on top edge of layer 23 → 2028

### 3. (24,23): x=24, y=23

This is outside the current layer. What layer is this in?

The layer for a point (x,y) is k = max(|x|, |y|)

So for (24,23): max(24,23)=24 → layer 24

Layer 24 starts at (2*24 -1)^2 + 1 = 47² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210

Layer 24 is a 49x49 square, from 2210 to 49²=2401

Layer 24 starts at (24,23) — same as layer 23 started at (23,22)

General pattern: layer k starts at (k, k-1)

So layer 24 starts at (24,23) → so **2210 is at (24,23)**

Yes!

So (24,23) = 2210

### 4. (24,22): x=24, y=22 → layer 24

Layer 24: starts at (24,23)=2210

Then moves up? No — direction after start is **up** along the right edge.

Wait, layer 24 starts at (24,23)=2210

Then moves **up** to (24,24) — but y=24 is the top.

Wait, standard: layer k starts at (k, k-1), then moves up to (k,k), then left along top.

So for layer 24:

- 2210: (24,23)
- 2211: (24,24) ← top-right corner
- Then left along top: (23,24), (22,24), ..., (-24,24)

So (24,22) is below the start point.

(24,22) is on the right edge of layer 24, but below the start.

The right edge of layer 24 is from (24,-24) to (24,24)

We have:

- (24,24) = 2211
- (24,23) = 2210
- Then we go down: (24,22), (24,21), ..., (24,-24)

So the numbers on the right edge, from (24,24) down to (24,-24): 49 numbers.

But (24,24)=2211, (24,23)=2210, then (24,22)=2209? But 2209 is already taken by the end of layer 23.

Wait, 2209 is the last number of layer 23, which is at (23,-23)? No.

Wait, layer 23 ends at 2209, which is at (23,21)? Earlier we said:

Layer 23 ends at (23,21)? No.

Earlier: layer 23 ends at 2209, which is the last number on the right edge, at (23,21)? Let's check.

We had:

- Right edge of layer 23: from (23,22)=2026, (23,23)=2027, then top, left, bottom, then up from (23,-23) to (23,21) → 2166 to 2209

So (23,21) = 2209

Now, (24,22) is adjacent to (23,22)=2026 and (24,23)=2210

What number is at (24,22)?

It is not in layer 23 (max(|x|,|y|)=24? No, max(24,22)=24 → layer 24

Layer 24: starts at (24,23)=2210

Then moves up to (24,24)=2211

Then moves left along top: (23,24)=2212, (22,24)=2213, ..., (-24,24)=2210 + 48 = 2258? Let's not compute.

Then down the left edge, etc.

But (24,22) is on the right edge, below the start.

So after placing (24,23)=2210 and (24,24)=2211, the spiral will go left, then down, then right, then up — but the right edge below (24,23) is filled last.

In layer 24, the right edge is filled last: from (24,-24) up to (24,23)

So (24,22) is filled when going up from (24,-24) to (24,23)

The bottom-right corner of layer 24 is (24,-24)

The number at (24,-24) is: total numbers in layer 24: 8*24=192

Layer 24: 2210 to 2401

The bottom-right corner (24,-24) is the last number of the bottom edge.

The bottom edge is the 3rd side.

Breakdown for layer 24:

- Start: (24,23)=2210
- Up to (24,24): 2211 (1 step)
- Left along top: 48 steps → 2212 to 2259 (48 numbers)
- Down left edge: 48 steps → 2260 to 2307
- Right along bottom: 48 steps → 2308 to 2355
- Up right edge: 47 steps → 2356 to 2402? But 2401 is last.

Wait: 2401 - 2210 + 1 = 192 numbers.

Breakdown:

- (24,23): 2210
- (24,24): 2211 → 1 number
- Top edge: from (23,24) to (-24,24): 48 numbers → 2212 to 2259
- Left edge: from (-24,23) to (-24,-24): 48 numbers → 2260 to 2307
- Bottom edge: from (-23,-24) to (24,-24): 48 numbers → 2308 to 2355
- Right edge: from (24,-23) to (24,23): 47 numbers → 2356 to 2402? 2402-2356+1=47 → but 2401 is last.

So 2356 to 2401 = 46 numbers? 2401 - 2356 + 1 = 46

Wait, 2356 to 2401 is 46 numbers.

Total: 1 + 48 + 48 + 48 + 46 = 191 → missing one.

Ah, the start is (24,23)=2210, then (24,24)=2211 — so the right edge is from (24,-24) up to (24,22), since (24,23) and (24,24) are already filled.

So right edge has: y from -24 to 22 → 22 - (-24) + 1 = 47 positions

But (24,23) and (24,24) are already used, so we fill 47 numbers on right edge: from (24,-24) to (24,22)

So:

- (24,-24): 2308 + 48 - 1 = 2355? Wait.

Bottom edge ends at (24,-24) = 2355

Then right edge: from (24,-23) to (24,22): 46 numbers? y from -23 to 22: 22 - (-23) + 1 = 46

So:

- (24,-24): 2355
- (24,-23): 2356
- ...
- (24,22): 2356 + 45 = 2401

So (24,22) = 2401

Yes!

So **(24,22) = 2401**

### 5. (24,21): on the right edge of layer 24

From above: (24,22)=2401, (24,21)=2400, (24,20)=2399, etc.

So (24,21) = 2400

### 6. (22,22): this is inside layer 23? max(|22|,|22|)=22 → layer 22

Layer 22 ends at 2025, which is at (22,22)

So (22,22) = 2025

### 7. (22,21): layer 22? max(22,21)=22 → layer 22

Layer 22: 45x45 square, ends at (22,22)=2025

What is the number at (22,21)?

Layer 22: starts at (22,21)? No.

Layer 22: starts at (22,21)? Let's recall.

Layer k starts at (k, k-1)

So layer 22 starts at (22,21)

And ends at (22,22)=2025

So (22,21) = first number of layer 22 = (2*22 -1)^2 + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850

So (22,21) = 1850

### 8. (24,23) = 2210 — already done

### 9. (23,21): on the right edge of layer 23

Earlier: layer 23 right edge ends at (23,21)=2209

Yes! We had: 2166 to 2209 on right edge from (23,-23) to (23,21)

So (23,21) = 2209

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors and their values:

1. (22,21) = 1850  
2. (23,21) = 2209  
3. (24,21) = 2400  
4. (22,22) = 2025  
5. (24,22) = 2401  
6. (22,23) = 2028  
7. (23,23) = 2027  
8. (24,23) = 2210  

Now, sum them up:

Let’s compute step by step.

List:

- 1850
- 2209
- 2400
- 2025
- 2401
- 2028
- 2027
- 2210

Add them in pairs.

Group:

1850 + 2400 = 4250  
2209 + 2401 = 4610  
2025 + 2028 = 4053  
2027 + 2210 = 4237  

Now sum these:

4250 + 4610 = 8860  
4053 + 4237 = 8290  
Total = 8860 + 8290 = 17150

Double-check with direct addition:

Let me write all:

1850  
2209  
2400  
2025  
2401  
2028  
2027  
2210  
——

Add in order:

Start with 1850 + 2209 = 4059  
4059 + 2400 = 6459  
6459 + 2025 = 8484  
8484 + 2401 = 10885  
10885 + 2028 = 12913  
12913 + 2027 = 14940  
14940 + 2210 = 17150

Yes.
