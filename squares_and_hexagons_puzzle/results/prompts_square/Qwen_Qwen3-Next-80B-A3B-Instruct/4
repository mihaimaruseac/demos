We are given a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting at 1 in the center, and spiraling outward. The example shows:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a **clockwise spiral**, starting at 1, moving right, then down, then left, then up, etc.

We need to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the spiral structure

The spiral grows in **layers** or **rings** around the center.

- Layer 0: just the center, number 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (3x3 square)
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 (5x5 square)
- Layer 3: numbers 26 to 49 (7x7 square)
- ...
- Layer k: numbers from `(2k-1)^2 + 1` to `(2k+1)^2`

In general, the **last number** in layer `k` is `(2k + 1)^2`.

So, to find which layer 2026 is in, we find the smallest odd square ≥ 2026.

Compute:

- `44^2 = 1936`
- `45^2 = 2025`
- `46^2 = 2116`

So:

- 2025 = `45^2` → this is the last number of layer `(45 - 1)/2 = 22`
- So layer 22 ends at 2025
- Therefore, **2026 is the first number of layer 23**

So 2026 is the **first number** in **layer 23**.

### Step 2: Understand the structure of a layer

Each layer `k` is a square ring of width 1 around the previous square.

The side length of the square at layer `k` is `2k + 1`.

So for layer 23, the square is `47 x 47`, and the previous square (layer 22) was `45 x 45`.

The numbers in layer 23 go from `2026` to `47^2 = 2209`.

The **first number** of the layer, 2026, is located **immediately to the right** of the last number of the previous layer (2025).

In the spiral, after completing layer 22 (ending at 2025 at the **top-right corner** of the 45x45 square), the next move is **right** to start layer 23.

So:

- The last number of layer 22 (2025) is at the **top-right corner** of the 45x45 square.
- Then we move **right** one step → that’s position of 2026.

So, **2026 is located one unit to the right of the top-right corner of the 45x45 square**.

Let’s assign coordinates.

Set the center (number 1) at `(0,0)`.

Then, the top-right corner of the 45x45 square (layer 22) is at `(22, 22)`.

Why?

- Layer 0: 1x1 → center (0,0)
- Layer 1: 3x3 → corners at (±1, ±1)
- Layer k: square from `-k` to `+k` in both x and y

So the square of layer k has coordinates from `-k` to `+k`.

Thus, the top-right corner of layer 22 is at `(22, 22)`, and it contains the number `45^2 = 2025`.

Then, 2026 is one step to the right → `(23, 22)`

So:

> **2026 is at position (23, 22)**

### Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors of (23, 22)

The 8 neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

```
(22,21) (23,21) (24,21)
(22,22) (23,22) (24,22)
(22,23) (23,23) (24,23)
```

We need the numbers in those 8 positions.

We know that 2026 is at (23,22). So we need the numbers at the other 8 positions.

We need to find the number at each of these 8 coordinates.

To do that, we need to **reverse-engineer the spiral**: given a coordinate (x,y), what number is there?

### Step 4: General method to find number at (x,y)

We can compute the number at any coordinate (x,y) by determining which layer it's in, then finding its position on the ring.

Let `n = max(|x|, |y|)` → this is the layer number.

If `n = 0`, number is 1.

Otherwise, the layer is `n`, and the **last number** in the previous layer is `(2n - 1)^2`.

The current layer (layer n) has numbers from `(2n - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2n + 1)^2`.

The layer has 4 sides, each of length `2n` (since the square has side `2n+1`, and the ring has 4 sides of `2n` numbers each? Actually, total numbers in layer: `(2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = 8n`.

Yes: 8n numbers in layer n.

The 4 sides:

1. **Right edge**: from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)` → moving **up**
2. **Top edge**: from `(n-1, n)` to `(-n, n)` → moving **left**
3. **Left edge**: from `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)` → moving **down**
4. **Bottom edge**: from `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)` → moving **right**

Wait — actually, the spiral goes:

Start at `(n, -n+1)`? Let’s think carefully.

Actually, the spiral moves **right** from the end of the previous layer.

At the end of layer `n-1`, we are at `(n-1, n-1)` — the top-right corner.

Then we move **right** to `(n, n-1)` — that’s the **first** number of layer `n`.

Wait, in our case:

- Layer 22 ends at (22,22) with 2025
- Then we move **right** to (23,22) → 2026

So the **first** number of layer `n` is at `(n, n-1)`

Then the spiral proceeds:

- Move **up** along the right side: from `(n, n-1)` to `(n, n)` → this is side 1
- Then move **left** along the top: from `(n-1, n)` to `(-n, n)` → side 2
- Then move **down** along the left: from `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)` → side 3
- Then move **right** along the bottom: from `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)` → side 4

Wait, let’s check the direction.

Actually, standard spiral direction is:

After finishing layer `n-1` at `(n-1, n-1)` (top-right), we move:

1. **Right** to `(n, n-1)` → start of layer n
2. Then **Up** to `(n, n)` → top-right corner of new layer
3. Then **Left** to `(-n, n)` → top-left corner
4. Then **Down** to `(-n, -n)` → bottom-left corner
5. Then **Right** to `(n, -n)` → bottom-right corner
6. Then **Up** to `(n, -n+1)`? But we already started at `(n, n-1)`.

Actually, the 4 sides of the layer are:

- **Right side**: from `(n, n-1)` to `(n, n)` → upward → length = `n - (n-1) + 1`? Wait, from y = n-1 to y = n → 1 step? That can’t be.

Wait, better to think in terms of **steps**.

The layer `n` has side length `2n+1`, so the ring has 8n numbers.

The 4 sides each have `2n` numbers? 4 * 2n = 8n — yes.

So each side has `2n` numbers.

So:

- Side 1: Right edge — moving **up** from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)` → y from `-n+1` to `n` → that’s `2n` values? From `-n+1` to `n` is `n - (-n+1) + 1 = 2n` → yes.

Wait, that contradicts our earlier step.

In our case, we started at `(23,22)` for 2026.

But according to this, the right side should go from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)`.

So for n=23: from `(23, -22)` to `(23,23)` → 46 numbers? But 2n = 46 → yes.

But we started at `(23,22)`, not `(23,-22)`.

So something is off.

Wait — perhaps the **first** number of layer n is at `(n, n-1)`? But that’s only one point.

Let’s test with small n.

### Test with layer 1 (n=1)

Layer 0 ends at (0,0) = 1

Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9

Spiral path:

Start at (0,0) = 1

Move right → (1,0) = 2

Move up → (1,1) = 3

Move left → (0,1) = 4, (-1,1) = 5

Move down → (-1,0) = 6, (-1,-1) = 7

Move right → (0,-1) = 8, (1,-1) = 9

Wait, so the layer 1 ring has:

- Right side: (1,0)=2 → (1,1)=3 → 2 numbers? But 2n=2 → yes.

So side 1 (right): from (1,0) to (1,1) — up → 2 numbers: 2,3

Side 2 (top): from (0,1)=4 to (-1,1)=5 — left → 2 numbers

Side 3 (left): from (-1,0)=6 to (-1,-1)=7 — down → 2 numbers

Side 4 (bottom): from (0,-1)=8 to (1,-1)=9 — right → 2 numbers

So the **first** number of layer n is at `(n, -n+1)`? For n=1: (1, -1+1) = (1,0) → yes! That's where 2 is.

So general rule:

- Layer n starts at `(n, -n+1)` with number `(2n-1)^2 + 1`

Wait, for n=1: (2*1 -1)^2 +1 = 1 +1 = 2 → correct.

For n=2: layer starts at (2, -2+1) = (2,-1), number = (3)^2 +1 = 10 → correct (from example: 10 to 25)

So:

> The **first number** of layer `n` is at `(n, -n+1)` and equals `(2n-1)^2 + 1`

Then, the spiral proceeds:

- **Side 1 (right edge)**: move **up** from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)` → y from `-n+1` to `n` → 2n numbers → positions: `(n, y)` for y = -n+1 to n

- **Side 2 (top edge)**: move **left** from `(n-1, n)` to `(-n, n)` → x from n-1 down to -n → 2n numbers → positions: `(x, n)` for x = n-1 down to -n

- **Side 3 (left edge)**: move **down** from `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)` → y from n-1 down to -n → 2n numbers → positions: `(-n, y)` for y = n-1 down to -n

- **Side 4 (bottom edge)**: move **right** from `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)` → x from -n+1 to n → 2n numbers → positions: `(x, -n)` for x = -n+1 to n

Now, in our case: **n = 23**

Layer 23 starts at `(23, -22)` with number 2026? Wait:

Wait, `(2n-1)^2 + 1 = (45)^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026` → yes!

So 2026 is at `(23, -22)`

Wait — this contradicts our earlier conclusion!

Earlier we thought 2026 is at `(23,22)`, but according to this, it’s at `(23, -22)`

What’s going on?

Ah! I made a mistake in the direction of the spiral!

In the problem, the example shows:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

So from 1 (center), we go right to 2, then up to 3, then left to 4,5, then down to 6,7, then right to 8,9.

So the spiral goes:

1 (0,0)

→ right to 2 (1,0)

→ up to 3 (1,1)

→ left to 4 (0,1), 5 (-1,1)

→ down to 6 (-1,0), 7 (-1,-1)

→ right to 8 (0,-1), 9 (1,-1)

So the spiral goes: **right, up, left, down, right, ...**

So the first move after center is **right**, then **up**.

Therefore, the **first number of layer n** is at `(n, -n+1)`? For n=1: (1,0) → yes.

But in our coordinate system, **y increases upward**, so (1,0) is right of center, (1,1) is up-right.

So the top-right corner of layer 1 is (1,1) = 3

The last number of layer 1 is 9 at (1,-1)

So for layer 23, the **first number** is at `(23, -22)` — that is, **23 units right, 22 units down** from center.

But earlier I thought the last number of layer 22 was at (22,22), and we moved right to (23,22) — but that would be **up**, not down.

So I had the direction of the spiral wrong.

Actually, the last number of layer 22 is at the **bottom-right corner** of the 45x45 square.

Because in layer 1, last number is at (1,-1) — bottom-right.

In layer 2: last number is 25 at (2,-2)

So layer k ends at `(k, -k)`

So layer 22 ends at `(22, -22)` with number `45^2 = 2025`

Then the next move is **right** → to `(23, -22)` → that's 2026

So **2026 is at (23, -22)**

This makes sense.

So our coordinate system:

- Center: (0,0) = 1
- Right: +x
- Up: +y
- So (23, -22) is 23 right, 22 down

Now we want the 8 neighbors of (23, -22)

That is:

All positions (x,y) where x in {22,23,24}, y in {-23,-22,-21}

So the 8 neighbors:

1. (22, -23)
2. (23, -23)
3. (24, -23)
4. (22, -22)
5. (24, -22) ← this is 2026 itself, skip
6. (22, -21)
7. (23, -21)
8. (24, -21)

We need the numbers at these 8 positions.

Now, we need to compute the number at each of these coordinates.

We know that these are in **layer 23**, except possibly some on the boundary.

But (22,-23): x=22, y=-23 → max(|x|,|y|) = max(22,23) = 23 → layer 23

Similarly, all 8 neighbors have max(|x|,|y|) = 23 → so they are all in **layer 23**

So all 8 numbers are in layer 23, which runs from 2026 to 2209.

We need to compute the number at each of these 8 positions.

Recall the 4 sides of layer 23:

Layer 23: n = 23

Starts at (23, -22) = 2026

Side 1: Right edge — move **up** from (23, -22) to (23, 23)

- y from -22 to 23 → 46 numbers (2n = 46)
- So positions: (23, y) for y = -22, -21, ..., 23 → total 46 numbers
- So number at (23, y) = 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22 = 2048 + y

Wait, let’s check:

At y = -22: 2026 + 0 = 2026 → correct

At y = -21: 2027

...

At y = 23: 2026 + (23 - (-22)) = 2026 + 45 = 2071

So formula for side 1: (23, y) → number = 2026 + (y + 22)

Side 2: Top edge — move **left** from (22, 23) to (-23, 23)

- Starts at (22,23) — next number after (23,23)=2071 → so 2072 at (22,23)

- x from 22 down to -23 → 46 numbers: x = 22,21,...,-23

- So number at (x,23) = 2071 + (22 - x) + 1 = 2072 + (22 - x)

Wait:

At x=22: 2072

x=21: 2073

...

x=-23: 2072 + (22 - (-23)) = 2072 + 45 = 2117

But total side 2 has 46 numbers, from 2072 to 2117 → 2117 - 2072 + 1 = 46 → yes.

So formula: number = 2072 + (22 - x) = 2094 - x

Side 3: Left edge — move **down** from (-23, 22) to (-23, -23)

- Starts at (-23,22) — after ( -23,23) = 2117? Wait no.

Wait, side 2 ends at (-23,23) = 2117

Then side 3: move down from (-23,22) to (-23,-23)

So next number is at (-23,22) = 2118

Then down to y = -23 → y from 22 down to -23 → 46 numbers

Number at (-23, y) = 2118 + (22 - y)

Check:

y=22: 2118 + 0 = 2118

y=21: 2119

...

y=-23: 2118 + (22 - (-23)) = 2118 + 45 = 2163

Side 4: Bottom edge — move **right** from (-22, -23) to (23, -23)

- Starts at (-22, -23) — after (-23,-23)=2163 → so 2164

- x from -22 to 23 → 46 numbers

Number at (x, -23) = 2164 + (x - (-22)) = 2164 + x + 22 = 2186 + x

Check:

x=-22: 2186 -22 = 2164 → yes

x=23: 2186 + 23 = 2209 → which is 47^2 = 2209 → correct

Now we have formulas for all 4 sides.

We need numbers at the 8 neighbors of (23, -22):

List of neighbors:

1. (22, -23) → bottom edge → side 4 → x=22, y=-23 → number = 2186 + 22 = **2208**

2. (23, -23) → bottom edge? No, (23,-23) is on side 4? Side 4 is bottom edge: y=-23, x from -22 to 23 → yes, x=23 is included.

Wait, (23,-23) is the **last** point of side 4 → number = 2186 + 23 = **2209**

3. (24, -23) → wait, x=24? But layer 23 only goes to x=23!

Wait, (24, -23) → max(|24|, |-23|) = 24 → that’s **layer 24**

Oh no! We made a mistake.

The neighbors of (23, -22) include (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21), etc.

But (24, -22): max(|24|, |-22|) = 24 → layer 24

Similarly, (24, -23): layer 24

(24, -21): layer 24

(22, -21): max(|22|, |-21|)=22 → layer 22

(22, -23): max(22,23)=23 → layer 23

(23, -23): layer 23

(22, -21): layer 22

So **some neighbors are in layer 22 or 24**, not all in layer 23!

We must compute numbers in **layer 22** and **layer 24** as well.

This is critical.

So let’s list the 8 neighbors again and determine their layers:

| Position     | max(|x|,|y|) | Layer |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| (22, -23)    | max(22,23)=23 | 23    |
| (23, -23)    | max(23,23)=23 | 23    |
| (24, -23)    | max(24,23)=24 | 24    |
| (22, -22)    | max(22,22)=22 | 22    |
| (24, -22)    | max(24,22)=24 | 24    |
| (22, -21)    | max(22,21)=22 | 22    |
| (23, -21)    | max(23,21)=23 | 23    |
| (24, -21)    | max(24,21)=24 | 24    |

So:

- Layer 22: (22, -22), (22, -21)
- Layer 23: (22, -23), (23, -23), (23, -21)
- Layer 24: (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)

We need to compute numbers in layers 22, 23, 24.

We already have formulas for layer 23.

Let’s compute each neighbor.

---

### 1. (22, -23) — layer 23, side 4 (bottom edge)

Formula for side 4: number = 2186 + x, y = -23

x = 22 → number = 2186 + 22 = **2208**

### 2. (23, -23) — layer 23, side 4

x = 23 → 2186 + 23 = **2209**

### 3. (24, -23) — layer 24

We need to compute number at (24, -23)

Layer 24: n=24

First number: (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = 47^2 +1 = 2209 +1 = 2210

Starts at (24, -23) — wait! According to our rule, first number of layer n is at (n, -n+1)

For n=24: (24, -23)

Exactly! So (24, -23) is the **first number** of layer 24 → **2210**

### 4. (22, -22) — layer 22

Layer 22: n=22

Last number: (2*22 +1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025

This point (22, -22) is the **bottom-right corner** of layer 22 → which is the **last number** of layer 22 → **2025**

### 5. (24, -22) — layer 24

Layer 24 starts at (24, -23) = 2210

Side 1: right edge — move up from (24, -23) to (24,24)

So (24, y) for y from -23 to 24 → 48 numbers

Number at (24, y) = 2210 + (y - (-23)) = 2210 + y + 23 = 2233 + y

So at (24, -22): y = -22 → 2233 -22 = **2211**

### 6. (22, -21) — layer 22

Layer 22: n=22

We need number at (22, -21)

Layer 22: last number is 2025 at (22, -22)

The layer 22 has 4 sides.

We need to find where (22, -21) is.

Layer 22: side 1: right edge — from (22, -21) to (22,22)? Wait.

Wait, layer 22 starts at (22, -21)? No.

Layer n starts at (n, -n+1)

So layer 22 starts at (22, -21) → number = (43)^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850

Wait, 43^2 = 1849 → yes.

So side 1: right edge — (22, y) for y from -21 to 22 → 44 numbers

So (22, -21) is the **first** number of layer 22 → **1850**

Wait, but we have (22, -22) = 2025, which is the last number.

So (22, -21) is the first number of the layer? That can’t be, because (22, -22) is the bottom-right corner.

Let me think.

Layer 22:

- Starts at (22, -21) = 1850

- Then moves up to (22,22) = 1850 + 43 = 1893? 44 numbers: from y=-21 to y=22 → 44 steps → 1850 to 1850+43=1893

Then side 2: top edge — from (21,22) to (-22,22) → 44 numbers → ends at (-22,22) = 1893 + 43 = 1936

Side 3: left edge — from (-22,21) to (-22,-22) → 44 numbers → ends at (-22,-22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979

Side 4: bottom edge — from (-21,-22) to (22,-22) → 44 numbers → ends at (22,-22) = 1979 + 43 = 2022? But should be 2025.

Wait, inconsistency.

Wait: total numbers in layer 22: 8*22 = 176

Last number = 45^2 = 2025

First number = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850

2025 - 1850 +1 = 176 → correct.

Now, side 4: bottom edge — from (-21, -22) to (22, -22) → 44 numbers

So the last number of side 4 is at (22, -22) = 1850 + 44*3 + 43? Let's compute cumulative.

Side 1: 44 numbers → ends at (22,22) = 1850 + 43 = 1893

Side 2: 44 numbers → ends at (-22,22) = 1893 + 43 = 1936

Side 3: 44 numbers → ends at (-22,-22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979

Side 4: 44 numbers → ends at (22,-22) = 1979 + 43 = 2022

But 2025 is the last number — 2022 ≠ 2025

Mistake.

Wait, side 4 should end at (22,-22) = 2025

So side 4 has 44 numbers, from 1980 to 2023? 2023 - 1980 +1 = 44

Then 2024 and 2025 are missing.

Wait — perhaps I miscounted the sides.

Wait, layer 22: 8*22 = 176 numbers

Side 1: (22, -21) to (22,22): y from -21 to 22 → 44 values → 44 numbers

Side 2: (21,22) to (-22,22): x from 21 down to -22 → 21 - (-22) +1 = 44 → yes

Side 3: (-22,21) to (-22,-22): y from 21 down to -22 → 21 - (-22) +1 = 44 → yes

Side 4: (-21,-22) to (22,-22): x from -21 to 22 → 22 - (-21) +1 = 44 → yes

Total: 4*44=176

Now, the last number of side 4 is at (22, -22) = 1850 + 175 = 2025 → correct

So side 4 starts at (-21,-22) = 1850 + 132 = 1982? Let's see:

Side 1: 1850 to 1893 (44 numbers)

Side 2: 1894 to 1937 (44)

Side 3: 1938 to 1981 (44)

Side 4: 1982 to 2025 (44)

So (22, -22) = 2025

Now, we want (22, -21)

This is on side 1: right edge — y from -21 to 22

So (22, -21) is the **first** point of side 1 → number = 1850

Yes.

So (22, -21) = **1850**

### 7. (23, -21) — layer 23, side 1

Side 1: (23, y) for y from -22 to 23

Number = 2026 + (y + 22)

y = -21 → 2026 + (-21 + 22) = 2026 + 1 = **2027**

### 8. (24, -21) — layer 24

Layer 24: n=24

Starts at (24, -23) = 2210

Side 1: (24, y) for y from -23 to 24 → number = 2210 + (y + 23) = 2233 + y

So (24, -21): y = -21 → 2233 -21 = **2212**

### Now, summarize the 8 neighbors:

1. (22, -23): 2208  
2. (23, -23): 2209  
3. (24, -23): 2210  
4. (22, -22): 2025  
5. (24, -22): 2211  
6. (22, -21): 1850  
7. (23, -21): 2027  
8. (24, -21): 2212  

Now sum them:

List:

- 2208
- 2209
- 2210
- 2025
- 2211
- 1850
- 2027
- 2212

Add step by step.

Group them:

First, the big ones: 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

That’s 5 numbers: 2208 to 2212 → 5 numbers, average 2210 → sum = 5 * 2210 = 11050

But let's compute exactly:

2208 + 2212 = 4420  
2209 + 2211 = 4420  
2210 = 2210  
Total = 4420 + 4420 + 2210 = 11050

Now the others: 2025, 1850, 2027

2025 + 2027 = 4052  
4052 + 1850 = 5902

Total sum = 11050 + 5902 = **16952**

Wait, but 11050 + 5902 = 16952

Let me verify:

11050  
+5902  
= 16952

Now, let me add all 8 numbers directly to confirm:

1. 2208  
2. 2209 → 4417  
3. 2210 → 6627  
4. 2025 → 8652  
5. 2211 → 10863  
6. 1850 → 12713  
7. 2027 → 14740  
8. 2212 → 16952

Yes.
