To solve this problem, we first need to understand how numbers are positioned in a spiral grid. The given spiral starts at the center with '1' and spirals outward counterclockwise.

We need to find the number 2026 and identify its 8 neighboring numbers to determine their sum.

Begin by identifying the layer each number is in. The number of elements per layer \(n\) (where \(n\) starts at 1 for the innermost layer) forms a perfect square:

- For \(n = 1\), the numbers go up to \(1^2 = 1\).
- For \(n = 2\), the numbers go up to \(3^2 = 9\).
- For \(n = 3\), the numbers go up to \(5^2 = 25\).
- Continuing this pattern, generalize as \(n^2\).

By continuing this sequence, we find \(n\) such that \(n^2 \leq 2026 < (n+2)^2\).

Calculate the values:

\[
45^2 = 2025 \quad \text{and} \quad 47^2 = 2209 
\]

This means 2026 is in the \(46^\text{th}\) layer because it is between 2025 and 2209.

To identify the position of 2026 within this layer, recall the sequence of steps within each layer cycle: right, up, left, down.

Calculate the sequence completion up to \(45^2 = 2025\) as the start of the \(46^\text{th}\) layer. The first position (2026) in the \(46^\text{th}\) layer is directly above 2025.

Following the layers: 

- From 2025 move 1 step right to 2026:
  - Left neighbor is 2025, 
  - Below neighbor is 2024, which loops around,
  - Remaining occupied 8 positions are part of sequence and symmetry.

To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors, draw out a grid or visualize number placements in multiple layers:

... 2020  2019    2018 ...
... 2021  2026    2027 ...
... 2022  2023    2024 ...

Fill in and calculate:

- Top neighbors: 2020, 2019
- Bottom neighbors: 2022, 2023
- Left neighbors: 2025
- Right neighbors: 2027
- Top-left: 2021
- Bottom-right: 2024 (ccw sequence completes)

Calculating the sum \(2025 (left) + 2027 (right) + 2023 (bottom) + 2024 (bot-right) + 2021 (top-left) + 2020 (top) + 2019 (top-right) + 2022 (bottom-left)\). 

Adding these values:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2023 + 2024 + 2021 + 2020 + 2019 + 2022 = 16261.
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{16261}\).
