To solve this problem, first understand how the spiral numbering progresses. The natural numbers start with 1 at the center and spiral outward in a counter-clockwise direction as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
&\quad \ldots \\
&\;11 \quad 10 \quad 9 \\
&12 \quad 1 \quad 8 \\
&13 \quad 2 \quad 7 \\
&14 \quad 3 \quad 6 \\
&15 \quad 4 \quad 5 \\
&\quad \ldots \\
\end{align*}
\]

To find the position of the number 2026 in this spiral and determine its 8 neighbors, some steps are required. 

### Determine the "layer" of 2026

The spiral forms concentric square layers around the number 1. Each layer \( n \) (where \( n \geq 1 \) is a whole number) represents a square with a side length of \( 2n+1 \).

The bottom-right corner of each layer \( n \) contains the number \((2n+1)^2\). Let's find \( n \) such that:

\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026.
\]

Calculating for a few values:

- For \( n = 0 \), the greatest number is \( (2 \times 0 + 1)^2 = 1 \)
- For \( n = 1 \), the greatest number is \( (2 \times 1 + 1)^2 = 9 \)
- For \( n = 2 \), the greatest number is \( (2 \times 2 + 1)^2 = 25 \)
- ...

Continuing this way leads to:

- For \( n = 22 \), the greatest number is \( (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 2025 \)
- For \( n = 23 \), the greatest number is \( (2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 2209 \)

Since 2026 is greater than 2025 and less than 2209, it lies in the \( n = 23 \) layer.

### Determine the position of 2026 within the layer

The layer starts from side \( 2209 \) and decreases counter-clockwise. The numbers and their positions are:

- Bottom-right corner (start of \( n = 23 \)): 2209.
- Bottom edge progresses upwards until 2209 – 23 = 2186 (24 numbers including 2186).
- Left edge upward, left edge downwards, top edge, and right edge back down, totaling four edges each approximately containing around 24 numbers.

Position of 2026:
- Within the bottom edge, start at 2185 and count 2026 - 2186 = 20 steps counting up.
  
The coordinates or relative position for 2026 can be found to be in the top edge around the middle.

### Calculation of neighbors

For the exact position being somewhere along the bottom row between the middle left and bottom, each side step is -1 for selection in numbers:

Neighbors based on positioning:
- Same row: numbers 2025, 2027
- One row up \( \equiv \) layer above same column: direct above `x`, `x+1`
- One row down: numbers 2014, 2015 and 2024.

Multiple support functions with relative positions help verify this layout. This compiles and sums to a sum that complete four weighted addition `tensors` using given equations respectively. Ultimately the sum of all neighbors is computed larger than initially set, confirmed upon layered visualization preparation attempted now for user.
