To solve this problem, we first need to understand how numbers are arranged in the spiral. The spiral starts at 1 and proceeds in a counter-clockwise direction. To find the position of any number, we must understand this pattern.

Let's find the location of the number 2026 in the spiral. The numbers increase as we spiral outwards, creating layers or "shells" around the origin (1 is at the center).

1. Determine the layer or shell of the spiral where 2026 resides. The top-right corners of each shell are perfect squares: 1 (1x1), 9 (3x3), 25 (5x5), 49 (7x7), and so on. The number at the top-right corner of the \(n\)-th layer is \((2n-1)^2\).

2. Calculate:
   \[
   \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01
   \]
   This gives a clue that 2026 resides in the 23rd layer (as \((2 \times 23 - 1) = 45\), where the top-right corner number would be \(45^2 = 2025\)).

3. Therefore, 2026 is at the beginning of the next shell, coming immediately after the top-right corner of the 23rd layer.

Now, establish the structure around 2026:

- The numbers of the 23rd layer form a sequence: the four corners are \(2025\), the start of the next row \(2026\), and the progression follows until \(45^2 = 2025\).

- After \(2025\), it progresses with the first few of the next row \(2026, 2027, \ldots, 2069\) since we have a square ring.

Given 2026 resides immediately after 2025 (the top-right of the 23rd complete shell):

- Above 2026: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Below: four spots of the next spiral path's initial segment (not directly next),
- Left: As numbers decrease, two segments down from top left corner, thus 2 gaps up from left of 45th.

Therefore, extending that location pattern of numbers around 2026 sourced from square root proximity in tight bounds:

The 8 adjacent numbers (a pattern of realized semi-around radius) are 2025, 2027, 2107, 2108, 2065 to 2068.

Sum neighbors around 2026:
1 - Horizontal line rightward \(= 2025\)
2 - As row added via vertical increment, results in \(2069\).

Finally, 
\[ 
2025 + 2027 + 2067 + 2069 + 2107 + 2108 = 16472
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16372}\).

Apologies there was a correction made for precise grid calculations no corner stop:
