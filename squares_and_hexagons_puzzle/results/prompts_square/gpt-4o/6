To solve this problem, we need to identify the location of the number 2026 in a spiral laid out on a square grid. Then we determine the numbers surrounding it and sum them.

The spiral starts at the center with 1, and spirals outward. The sequence of numbers along the path forms a pattern where each complete layer wraps around the preceding one.

In such a spiral, numbers at the corners of the spiral follow the pattern mentioned in the OEIS sequence A107856, where each corner of an outer layer forms a sequence of perfect squares and numbers derived from them. However, to find the specific number 2026 and its neighbors, we might use a different approach.

First, we attempt to determine the position of 2026 by establishing the layer it belongs to. The top right corner of layer \(n\) in the spiral is given by \( (2n+1)^2 \). We check which \(n\) makes \( (2n+1)^2 \) close to or larger than 2026:

\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Testing values for \(n\):

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \quad \text{and} \quad (2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

Since 2026 lies between 2025 and 2209, it's in the 23rd layer of the spiral. Let's determine the exact path:

1. The top-right corner of the 22nd layer is 2025.
2. The next number, 2026, starts the 23rd layer.

Given the structure of the spiral, we know that:
- The sequence continues right for 47 steps from 2026.
- Then goes down for 47 steps.
- Left for another 47 steps.
- Up for 47 to close the layer.

Now converging on the need to find neighbors:
- Directly above 2026 lies the end of the 22nd layer: 2002 (bottom-left of 22nd layer).
- Directly below lies: 2093.
- To the left lies: 2025.
- To the right lies: 2027.

Following the symmetry and pattern of layers,
- Top-left diagonal is: 2001.
- Bottom-left is: 2092.
- Top-right is: 2003.
- Bottom-right is: 2094.

Let's add these up:

\[
2002 + 2025 + 2093 + 2027 + 2001 + 2003 + 2092 + 2094 = 18337
\]

Thus, the sum of the 8 neighbors surrounding the number 2026 is \(\boxed{18337}\).
