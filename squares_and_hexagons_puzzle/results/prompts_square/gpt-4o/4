To solve this problem, we need to first identify the positioning of the number 2026 in the given spiral layout. The numbers in the spiral are arranged in consecutive layers surrounding the center starting at 1. Each layer forms a square with odd side lengths, and the numbers increase as you go clockwise starting from the center of the spiral.

To find the position for 2026, we need to determine which layer it belongs to. Naturally, these layers fill up in the order of 1, 9, 25, 49, ..., where the side length of the squares is an odd integer.

1. Notice that the corner numbers for each square layer are given by the pattern \((2n+1)^2\), where \(n\) starts at 0.

2. Compute some corner numbers:
   - Layer \(n = 0\): Corner number = \((2 \times 0 + 1)^2 = 1\)
   - Layer \(n = 1\): Corner number = \((2 \times 1 + 1)^2 = 9\)
   - Layer \(n = 2\): Corner number = \((2 \times 2 + 1)^2 = 25\)
   - Layer \(n = 3\): Corner number = \((2 \times 3 + 1)^2 = 49\)
   - Continue this process...
   - Layer \(n = 15\): Corner number = \((2 \times 15 + 1)^2 = 961\)
   - Layer \(n = 16\): Corner number = \((2 \times 16 + 1)^2 = 1089\)
   - ...
   - Layer \(n = 22\): Corner number = \((2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 2025\)
   - Layer \(n = 23\): Corner number = \((2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 2209\)

From the above, we see that 2026 is in the next layer after 2025, which is the start of layer 23.

Since 2025 is a corner number of the layer before, 2026 is the first number of the 23rd layer, which is located on the right side of the spiral grid.

We need to calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026. Since the pattern of the spiral moves in a counterclockwise fashion from a rightward start point, the adjacent numbers to 2025 will be calculated as such:

- The positions right next to 2025 (on its level) will be \(2025-1=2024\) to the left, and \(2025+2=2027\) which occurs after turning right past 2026.

Now let's find the sequence around 2026:

The positions around 2026 specifically are: 
- 2024 (one place before 2025 and anti-clockwise direction),
- 2025 (right below it),
- 2027 (flows naturally),
- Later going counter-clockwise in a complete circle in around 2026 within the said grid framework:

Following up:
- 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2028, which can be logically positioned around 2026 when you extend two layers worth (ensuring your spiral movement completes correctly).

Computational Calculation:
\[ 
2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 = 16170 
\]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16170}\).
