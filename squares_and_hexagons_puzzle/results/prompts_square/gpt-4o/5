To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral pattern laid out on a square grid, we first need to understand the spiral layout and position of the number in the grid. We recognize that the spiral starts from 1 at the center and moves right initially, spiraling outward counterclockwise.

Each layer of the spiral essentially forms a square, with the odd numbers all forming the outermost corners due to this spiral pattern. Notably, the pattern follows a sequence where the square of odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.) gives us the number at the corners of each outermost square layer:
- For example, \(3^2 = 9\), \(5^2 = 25\), \(7^2 = 49\), and so on.

To find the exact location of 2026, we need to determine which layer it is on. Calculate the side length of the square containing 2026. We need \(k\) such that \( (k-1)^2 < 2026 \leq k^2\).

\[
44^2 = 1936 \quad \text{and} \quad 45^2 = 2025
\]

This means 2026 does not fit within the square grid range covered by any perfect square less than or equal to 1936, and lies somewhere into the next square after 45^2.

Calculate:
- 45th square's boundary finishes with number \(2025\) 
- Start of \(k = 46\) layer (start of next spiral increment)
  
The number 2026 will be the start of the 46th square layer, indicating it resides one step further on a new spiral approach starting after the 45th layer completion.

The next task is to determine its neighbors in grid view. Number 2025 is one of those located at the bottom-right corner of the \(45 \times 45\) grid, denoting that 2026 should be just the start at bottom-left next layer or just below continuing in spiral sequence.

Placement of 2026 associates with starting bottom-right of outer layer pattern increasing both row and column consideration.

Calculate neighboring positions:
- Above 2026: We know 2027 lies following left spiral and increase.
- Below 2026: Position of 2026 has no direct underneath neighbors yet.
- Left: 2025 (previous spiral high aligned)
- Right: Side increment ascending starting next corners hence 2029 also vertical higher again.
- Diagonally: All direct as it covers next upper-row form sequence.

Neighbors association:
- 9 elements perceived, primarily overlapping from earlier due contributions of side limits and prior cross-checks spiral shifts.

Perform sum including:
\[
2018 + 2019 + 2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 = 16212
\]

The result aligns grid transition check from neat diagrammatic format, visual expenditure via examination gives all 8-summated terms:

\- \(\boxed{16216}\).
