To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral and then identify its neighbors.

The spiral pattern starts at the center of the square grid and spirals outwards, filling in the numbers as it goes. The numbers increase as we move away from the center.

Since the spiral starts at the center, the first few numbers are:

1 (center)
2, 3, 4, 5 (first layer around the center)
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (second layer around the center)
...

We can see that the numbers increase by 1 as we move to the next position in the spiral. However, as we move outwards, we also increase by the number of positions in the current layer. For example, after the first layer (1 to 5), the next layer (6 to 10) increases by 5 positions.

Let's find the position of 2026 on the spiral. We can do this by calculating how many numbers are before 2026 in the spiral.

The total number of positions in the spiral up to a given number can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers:

Sum = n(n + 1) / 2

We need to find the value of n such that the sum is just above 2026. Let's calculate:

Sum = n(n + 1) / 2 > 2026

We can estimate the value of n by trial and error or by solving the quadratic equation. Let's try to find a suitable n:
