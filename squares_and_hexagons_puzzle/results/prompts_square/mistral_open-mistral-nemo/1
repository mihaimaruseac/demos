To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral. Since the numbers are written on a square grid, we can assume that the spiral starts from the center and spirals outwards in a clockwise direction.

Let's start by finding the position of 2026 on the spiral. Since the spiral starts from the center, we can assume that the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern that increases by one as we move one step outwards from the center.

Let's assume that the number 1 is at the center of the spiral. The numbers would then increase as we move outwards in a spiral pattern. The number 2026 would be the 2025th number in the sequence (since we start counting from 1), and it would be positioned on the spiral accordingly.

However, without a specific pattern or grid size given, it's impossible to determine the exact position of 2026 on the spiral or the positions of its neighbors. We would need more information about the spiral's dimensions, the starting point, or the pattern of the numbers to calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

If you can provide more details about the spiral's layout or the pattern of the numbers, I can help you calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
