To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral. Since the numbers are written on a square grid, we can assume that the spiral starts at the center of the grid and spirals outwards in a clockwise direction.

Let's find the position of 2026 on the spiral. We can start by finding the position of the first few numbers:

1. The first number is 1, which is at the center of the spiral.
2. The second number is 2, which is one step to the right of the center.
3. The third number is 3, which is one step down from the center.
4. The fourth number is 4, which is one step to the left of the center.
5. The fifth number is 5, which is one step up from the center.

We can continue this pattern to find the position of 2026. However, since the grid is not provided, we cannot determine the exact position of 2026 without additional information. If you can provide the size of the grid or the total number of numbers on the spiral, we can calculate the position of 2026 and then find the sum of its neighbors.

Without the specific grid information, we cannot accurately determine the sum of the neighbors of 2026. If you can provide the missing details, I would be happy to help you calculate the sum.
