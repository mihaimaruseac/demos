To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine its position on the spiral grid. Since the numbers are written in a spiral pattern starting from the center, we can deduce that the number 2026 is at the center of the spiral, which is the starting point of the spiral.

The center of the spiral is the first number written, which is 1. Therefore, the number 2026 is at the center of the spiral, and it does not have any neighbors because it is the starting point.

However, if you are asking for the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026 in a different context, such as a grid with a different layout or a different set of numbers, please provide more information so that I can assist you further.
