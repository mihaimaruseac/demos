To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine its position on the spiral grid. Since the numbers are written in a spiral pattern starting from the center, we can assume that the spiral is symmetric and that the number 2026 is near the edge of the grid.

Let's assume that the grid is large enough to accommodate the number 2026. The number 2026 is a four-digit number, which suggests that the grid is at least 2026 x 2026 in size. However, we can use a smaller grid for demonstration purposes, as the pattern of neighbors will be the same regardless of the grid size.

Let's consider a smaller grid to illustrate the process:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

On this grid, the number 2026 would be near the bottom right corner. The neighbors of a number in a spiral grid are the numbers that are one step away in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and the two diagonal directions (up-right and down-right).

Let's assume that the number 2026 is at the position (2025, 2025) on a 2026 x 2026 grid. The neighbors of 2026 would be the numbers at the positions (2024, 2025), (2025, 2024), (2025, 2026), (2026, 2025), (2024, 2024), (2024, 2026), (2026, 2024), and (2026, 2026).

However, since we are dealing with a spiral grid, not all of these positions will have numbers. The numbers will only be present in the spiral pattern, and the numbers will increase as the spiral moves outward from the center.

Without the exact pattern of the spiral, we cannot determine the exact numbers that would be the neighbors of 2026. We would need to know the specific rules of the spiral's progression to calculate the sum of the neighbors.

If you can provide the specific rules of the spiral or the pattern of the numbers, I can assist you further in calculating the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026.
