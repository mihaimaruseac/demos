To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral. However, the pattern you've provided only shows the first few numbers on the spiral, and it's not clear how the spiral continues or how many numbers it contains.

Since we don't have the complete pattern of the spiral, we cannot accurately determine the position of 2026 or its neighbors. If you can provide the complete pattern or the rules for generating the spiral, I can help you find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
