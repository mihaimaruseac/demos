To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine its position on the spiral grid. Since the numbers are written in a spiral pattern starting from the center and moving outward, we can assume that the spiral is symmetric and that the number 2026 is near the edge of the grid.

Let's start by finding the number of rows and columns in the grid. Since the grid is square, we can assume that it has the same number of rows and columns. The number 1 is in the center, so the grid must be at least 3x3 to accommodate the spiral pattern. However, since we are looking for the number 2026, which is much larger than 9, the grid must be larger than 3x3.

The spiral pattern typically starts at the center and moves outward in a spiral pattern, filling in the numbers as it goes. Since the number 2026 is relatively large, it is likely near the edge of the grid. However, without more information about the size of the grid or the specific pattern of the spiral, we cannot determine the exact position of the number 2026.

If we assume that the grid is large enough to accommodate the number 2026, we can try to estimate its position. Since the numbers increase as we move outward from the center, the number 2026 is likely in one of the outer rows or columns. However, without more information, we cannot determine the exact position of the number 2026 or its 8 neighbors.

Therefore, with the information provided, it is not possible to determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid. We would need additional information about the size of the grid or the specific pattern of the spiral to make this determination.
