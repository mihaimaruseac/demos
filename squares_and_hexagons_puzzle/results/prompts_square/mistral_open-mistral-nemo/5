To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine its position on the spiral grid. Since the numbers are written in a spiral pattern starting from the center, we can assume that the spiral is symmetric and that the number 2026 is located in the center of the grid.

However, without knowing the size of the grid or the specific pattern of the spiral, we cannot determine the exact position of the number 2026 or its neighbors. The spiral could be of any size and the numbers could be arranged in various patterns.

If we assume that the spiral is a perfect square grid and that the number 2026 is in the center, then its neighbors would be the numbers immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it, as well as the four numbers diagonally adjacent to it.

Without the specific layout of the grid or the spiral pattern, we cannot calculate the sum of the neighbors of the number 2026. If you can provide more information about the grid size or the spiral pattern, I can help you calculate the sum of the neighbors.
