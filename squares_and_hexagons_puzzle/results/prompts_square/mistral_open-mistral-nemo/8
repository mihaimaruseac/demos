To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine its position on the spiral grid. Since the grid is a square and the numbers are written in a spiral pattern, we can assume that the grid is large enough to accommodate the number 2026.

The number 2026 is a four-digit number, which means it is likely to be in one of the outer layers of the spiral. To find its exact position, we would need to know the size of the grid or the pattern of the spiral. However, since we don't have that information, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern of the numbers we do have.

The pattern of the numbers we have (5, 4, 3, 6, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9) suggests that the spiral is moving clockwise and that the numbers are increasing as we move outward from the center. If we assume that the grid is large enough and that the spiral pattern continues in this manner, we can estimate that 2026 is likely to be in one of the corners of the grid, as those are the positions where the spiral would turn.

However, without the exact size of the grid or the pattern of the spiral, we cannot determine the exact position of 2026 or its neighbors. Therefore, we cannot calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 with the information provided.

If you can provide more details about the grid or the spiral pattern, I would be able to help you further.
