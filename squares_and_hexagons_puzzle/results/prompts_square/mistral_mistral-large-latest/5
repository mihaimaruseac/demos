Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this grid.

### Understanding the Spiral Structure

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. The given example shows a small portion of the spiral:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that:
- The number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers increase as we move outward in a counter-clockwise spiral:
  - 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in a 3x3 grid.
  - Then the next layer would be numbers 10 to 25 in a 5x5 grid, and so on.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. This involves figuring out which "ring" or "layer" the number is in and its exact coordinates within that layer.

**Defining Layers:**
- Layer 0: Just the number 1 at the center.
- Layer 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (3x3 grid minus the center).
- Layer 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (5x5 grid minus the inner 3x3).
- Generally, Layer k starts at (2k - 1)^2 + 1 and ends at (2k + 1)^2.

The side length of Layer k is (2k + 1).

**Finding the Layer for 2026:**
We need to find the smallest k such that (2k + 1)^2 ≥ 2026.

Let's calculate:
- For k=22: (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
- For k=23: (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209

2025 is the largest odd square less than 2026, so 2026 is in Layer 23 (since it's the first number after Layer 22's end at 2025).

**Position within the Layer:**
Layer 23 starts at 2026 (since 2025 is the last number of Layer 22) and goes up to 2209.

The side length of Layer 23 is 47 (since 2*23 + 1 = 47).

The first number in the layer is at the bottom-right corner of the square, and the numbers spiral inward counter-clockwise.

The sequence within a layer is:
1. Right side: up (numbers increase as we go up)
2. Top side: left
3. Left side: down
4. Bottom side: right

Since 2026 is the first number in Layer 23, it's at the bottom-right corner of the 47x47 square.

**Coordinates:**
Let's assign coordinates where (0,0) is the center (number 1).

For Layer k, the bottom-right corner is at (k, -k).

So, 2026 is at (23, -23).

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026

Now, we need to find all eight neighbors of (23, -23). The eight neighbors are the squares immediately surrounding it in all directions:

1. (23, -22) - above
2. (22, -22) - above-left
3. (22, -23) - left
4. (22, -24) - below-left
5. (23, -24) - below
6. (24, -24) - below-right
7. (24, -23) - right
8. (24, -22) - above-right

Now, we need to determine the numbers at these positions.

**Determining Numbers from Coordinates:**

This is the tricky part. We need a way to map coordinates to numbers in the spiral.

One approach is to determine the layer of each neighbor and then find the number based on its position within that layer.

Let's find the layer for each neighbor:

The layer of a coordinate (x, y) is max(|x|, |y|).

1. (23, -22): max(23, 22) = 23 (Layer 23)
2. (22, -22): max(22, 22) = 22 (Layer 22)
3. (22, -23): max(22, 23) = 23 (Layer 23)
4. (22, -24): max(22, 24) = 24 (Layer 24)
5. (23, -24): max(23, 24) = 24 (Layer 24)
6. (24, -24): max(24, 24) = 24 (Layer 24)
7. (24, -23): max(24, 23) = 24 (Layer 24)
8. (24, -22): max(24, 22) = 24 (Layer 24)

Now, let's find the numbers for each:

**Layer 23:**
Layer 23 starts at 2026 and has side length 47.

The sequence in Layer 23:
- Bottom side: from (23, -23) to (-23, -23): numbers 2026 to 2026 + 46 = 2072
- Left side: from (-23, -22) to (-23, 23): numbers 2073 to 2073 + 45 = 2118
- Top side: from (-22, 23) to (23, 23): numbers 2119 to 2119 + 45 = 2164
- Right side: from (23, 22) to (23, -22): numbers 2165 to 2165 + 44 = 2209

Now, let's find the numbers for the Layer 23 neighbors:

1. (23, -22):
   - This is on the right side, moving up from (23, -23) to (23, 23).
   - (23, -23) is 2026.
   - (23, -22) is one step up, so 2026 + 47 (bottom side) + 46 (left side) + 46 (top side) + 1 = 2026 + 47 + 46 + 46 + 1 = 2166
   Wait, let's think differently:
   - Bottom side: 2026 to 2072 (47 numbers)
   - Left side: 2073 to 2118 (46 numbers)
   - Top side: 2119 to 2164 (46 numbers)
   - Right side: 2165 to 2209 (45 numbers)
   - (23, -22) is on the right side, first number after top side.
   - Top side ends at (23, 23) = 2164
   - Next is (23, 22) = 2165
   - Then (23, 21) = 2166, ..., (23, -22) = 2165 + (22 - (-22)) - 1 = 2165 + 44 = 2209? Wait, no.
   - Actually, right side is from (23, 22) to (23, -22), which is 45 numbers (22 - (-22) + 1 = 45).
   - So (23, 22) = 2165, (23, 21) = 2166, ..., (23, -22) = 2165 + 44 = 2209
   - But (23, -22) is the last number in the layer, which is 2209, but we know 2026 is at (23, -23), so this can't be right.
   - Maybe the right side is from (23, 23) to (23, -22), but (23, 23) is the end of the top side, which is 2164.
   - Then (23, 22) = 2165, ..., (23, -22) = 2165 + 44 = 2209
   - But 2026 is at (23, -23), which is the first number in the layer, so this seems inconsistent.
   - Maybe the numbering is off. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach for Layer 23:
- The layer starts at (23, -23) = 2026
- Then moves up to (23, 23) = 2026 + 46 = 2072
- Then left to (-23, 23) = 2072 + 46 = 2118
- Then down to (-23, -23) = 2118 + 46 = 2164
- Then right to (23, -23) is already the start, so next is (23, -22) = 2165
- Then up to (23, 23) = 2165 + 45 = 2210, but the layer ends at 2209, so this is off by one.
Hmm, seems like the numbering is not matching. Maybe the layer starts at (k, -k) = n, then:
- up to (k, k): n + 2k
- left to (-k, k): n + 4k
- down to (-k, -k): n + 6k
- right to (k, -k + 1): n + 8k - 1
But for k=23, n=2026:
- up to (23,23): 2026 + 46 = 2072
- left to (-23,23): 2072 + 46 = 2118
- down to (-23,-23): 2118 + 46 = 2164
- right to (23,-22): 2164 + 45 = 2209
This matches the layer ending at 2209, so:
- (23, -22) = 2165
- (23, -21) = 2166, ..., (23, 23) = 2209
But (23, -23) is 2026, so (23, -22) is 2165.

3. (22, -23):
   - This is on the bottom side, moving left from (23, -23) to (-23, -23).
   - (23, -23) = 2026
   - (22, -23) = 2027
   - ...
   - (-23, -23) = 2026 + 46 = 2072

**Layer 22:**
Layer 22 starts at (22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 21^2 + 1 = 441 + 1 = 442
Ends at (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
Side length: 45

Sequence in Layer 22:
- Bottom side: (22, -22) to (-22, -22): 442 to 442 + 43 = 485
- Left side: (-22, -21) to (-22, 22): 486 to 486 + 43 = 529
- Top side: (-21, 22) to (22, 22): 530 to 530 + 43 = 573
- Right side: (22, 21) to (22, -21): 574 to 574 + 42 = 616
Wait, but the layer ends at 2025, so this seems off. Maybe the starting number is (2k - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850
Wait, no, the layer starts at (2k - 1)^2 + 1, so for k=22, (43)^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850
Ends at (45)^2 = 2025
Side length: 45

Sequence:
- Bottom: (22, -22) to (-22, -22): 1850 to 1850 + 43 = 1893
- Left: (-22, -21) to (-22, 22): 1894 to 1894 + 43 = 1937
- Top: (-21, 22) to (22, 22): 1938 to 1938 + 43 = 1981
- Right: (22, 21) to (22, -21): 1982 to 1982 + 42 = 2024
- Then (22, -22) would be next, but the layer ends at 2025, so (22, -22) is 2025.

But our neighbor is (22, -22), which is 2025.

**Layer 24:**
Layer 24 starts at (2*24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210
Ends at (2*24 + 1)^2 = 49^2 = 2401
Side length: 49

Sequence:
- Bottom: (24, -24) to (-24, -24): 2210 to 2210 + 47 = 2257
- Left: (-24, -23) to (-24, 24): 2258 to 2258 + 47 = 2305
- Top: (-23, 24) to (24, 24): 2306 to 2306 + 47 = 2353
- Right: (24, 23) to (24, -23): 2354 to 2354 + 46 = 2400
- Then (24, -24) would be next, but the layer ends at 2401, so (24, -24) is 2401.

Now, let's find the numbers for the Layer 24 neighbors:

4. (22, -24):
   - This is outside Layer 24's bottom side (which is from (24, -24) to (-24, -24)), so it's not in Layer 24.
   - Wait, the layer is max(|x|, |y|), so (22, -24) is max(22, 24) = 24, so it's in Layer 24.
   - It's on the left side of the bottom side.
   - Bottom side: (24, -24) to (-24, -24): 2210 to 2257
   - (22, -24) is 2 steps left from (24, -24), so 2210 + 2 = 2212

5. (23, -24):
   - max(23, 24) = 24, Layer 24
   - On the bottom side, 1 step left from (24, -24), so 2210 + 1 = 2211

6. (24, -24):
   - Bottom-right corner of Layer 24, which is 2210

7. (24, -23):
   - On the right side, first step up from (24, -24), so 2354

8. (24, -22):
   - On the right side, two steps up from (24, -24), so 2354 + 1 = 2355

### Summarizing the Neighbors:

Now, let's list all eight neighbors with their numbers:

1. (23, -22): 2165 (Layer 23, right side)
2. (22, -22): 2025 (Layer 22, last number)
3. (22, -23): 2027 (Layer 23, bottom side)
4. (22, -24): 2212 (Layer 24, bottom side)
5. (23, -24): 2211 (Layer 24, bottom side)
6. (24, -24): 2210 (Layer 24, start)
7. (24, -23): 2354 (Layer 24, right side)
8. (24, -22): 2355 (Layer 24, right side)

Now, sum them up:

2165 + 2025 + 2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2354 + 2355

Let's calculate step by step:

2165 + 2025 = 4190
4190 + 2027 = 6217
6217 + 2212 = 8429
8429 + 2211 = 10640
10640 + 2210 = 12850
12850 + 2354 = 15204
15204 + 2355 = 17559

### Verifying the Calculation

Let me double-check the numbers assigned to each neighbor to ensure no mistakes were made.

1. (23, -22): Layer 23, right side. (23, -23) is 2026, then up to (23, 23) is 2072, then left to (-23, 23) is 2118, then down to (-23, -23) is 2164, then right starts at (23, -22) = 2165. Correct.
2. (22, -22): Layer 22 ends at 2025, which is at (22, -22). Correct.
3. (22, -23): Layer 23, bottom side. (23, -23) is 2026, so (22, -23) is 2027. Correct.
4. (22, -24): Layer 24, bottom side. (24, -24) is 2210, so (23, -24) is 2211, (22, -24) is 2212. Correct.
5. (23, -24): 2211. Correct.
6. (24, -24): 2210. Correct.
7. (24, -23): Layer 24, right side starts at (24, -22) = 2355, so (24, -23) is 2354. Correct.
8. (24, -22): 2355. Correct.

The sum calculation also seems correct.

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is **17,559**.
