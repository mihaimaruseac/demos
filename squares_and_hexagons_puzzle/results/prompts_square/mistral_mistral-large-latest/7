Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this grid.

### Understanding the Spiral Structure

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. The given example shows a small portion of the spiral:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the number 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward in a counter-clockwise direction:

- 1 is at the center.
- 2 is to its right.
- 3 is above 2.
- 4 is to the left of 3.
- 5 is to the left of 4.
- 6 is below 5.
- 7 is below 6.
- 8 is to the right of 7.
- 9 is to the right of 8, and so on.

This pattern continues as the spiral grows outward.

### Identifying the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. One way to do this is to find out in which "ring" or "layer" the number 2026 resides.

The center is 1 (layer 0). The first layer around it contains numbers 2 through 9 (8 numbers), the second layer contains numbers 10 through 25 (16 numbers), and so on.

In general, the nth layer (starting from 0) contains numbers from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)², and the count of numbers in the nth layer is 8n.

Let's find out which layer 2026 is in.

First, find the largest odd square less than or equal to 2026.

Calculate squares of odd numbers:

- 43² = 1849
- 45² = 2025
- 47² = 2209

2025 is the largest odd square less than 2026, so 2026 is in the layer where the maximum number is 2025, which is the (45-1)/2 = 22nd layer (since 2n+1=45 => n=22).

Wait, let's clarify the layer numbering:

If layer 0 is just 1 (center), then:

- Layer 1: from 2 to 9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: from 10 to 25 (16 numbers)
- ...
- Layer n: from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)², with 8n numbers.

So, (2n+1)² ≥ 2026 > (2n-1)²

Find n such that (2n-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2n+1)²

Compute (2n+1)² = 2025 => 2n+1=45 => n=22

So, 2026 is in layer 22, starting at (2*22 -1)² +1 = 43² +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850, ending at 45² = 2025.

But 2026 is the first number after layer 22, so it's the first number in layer 23.

Wait, no: layer n goes up to (2n+1)², so layer 22 goes up to 45²=2025, so 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

But layer 23 would start at (2*23 -1)² +1 = 45² +1 = 2026, and go up to (2*23 +1)² = 47² = 2209.

So, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Determining the Position of 2026

Now, let's determine where 2026 is located in the spiral.

The first number in layer n is at the bottom right corner of the square, just below the last number of the previous layer.

Layer 22 ends at 2025, which is at the bottom right corner of the 45x45 square (since 45 is odd, the square is centered at 1).

The next number, 2026, is directly below 2025, starting the next layer.

So, 2026 is at the bottom right corner of the 45x45 square, one step down from 2025.

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026

Now, let's find the eight neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are the numbers directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Given that 2026 is at the start of a new layer, it's at the bottom right corner of the previous square. Its neighbors would be:

1. Top: The number directly above 2026.
2. Top-left: Diagonally above and to the left.
3. Left: Directly to the left.
4. Bottom-left: Diagonally below and to the left.
5. Bottom: Directly below.
6. Bottom-right: Diagonally below and to the right.
7. Right: Directly to the right.
8. Top-right: Diagonally above and to the right.

However, since 2026 is at the start of a new layer, some of these neighbors may not exist or may be part of the previous layer.

Let's think about the position:

- 2025 is at the bottom right corner of the 45x45 square.
- 2026 is directly below 2025, starting the next layer.

So, the neighbors are:

1. Top: 2025 (directly above)
2. Top-left: The number to the top-left of 2026. Since 2026 is at the bottom right of the new layer, the top-left would be the last number of the previous layer's bottom side, which is 2025 - 44 = 1981 (since the bottom side of layer 22 has 45 numbers: 1981 to 2025).
   Wait, let's think differently: the bottom side of layer n has 2n+1 numbers. For layer 22, bottom side is 45 numbers: from 2025 - 44 = 1981 to 2025.
   So, top-left of 2026 is 2025 - 1 = 2024 (since 2025 is top, 2024 is top-left).
   Wait, no: the top-left neighbor is diagonally up and left, which would be the number to the left of 2025, which is 2024.
3. Left: Directly left of 2026 is the number to the left of where 2026 is placed. Since 2026 is below 2025, left would be the number below 2024, which is the start of the left side of the new layer. The left side of layer 23 starts at 2026 and goes up to 2026 + 45 -1 = 2070.
   So, left of 2026 is the number that would be there if we were to fill the left side, but since 2026 is the first, left is empty or not part of the grid yet. Wait, no: the left neighbor is the number that is to the immediate left in the grid, which would be the number that is placed before 2026 in the spiral. But 2026 is the first in its layer, so left is not yet filled. Maybe it's better to think in terms of coordinates.

### Assigning Coordinates to Numbers

Let's assign coordinates to the numbers to make this easier. Let’s place 1 at (0,0), and then define directions:

- Right: (x+1, y)
- Up: (x, y+1)
- Left: (x-1, y)
- Down: (x, y-1)

The spiral starts at 1 at (0,0), then:

2: (1,0)
3: (1,1)
4: (0,1)
5: (-1,1)
6: (-1,0)
7: (-1,-1)
8: (0,-1)
9: (1,-1)
10: (2,-1)
...

This seems a bit messy. Alternatively, we can note that the number at position (x,y) can be determined based on the layer it's in.

The layer n is the set of points where max(|x|,|y|) = n.

The number at (n, -n) is (2n-1)² + 1 (start of layer n).

Then, moving up the right side: (n, -n + k) for k from 0 to 2n: number is (2n-1)² + 1 + k.

Then, moving left along the top: (-n + k, n) for k from 0 to 2n: number is (2n-1)² + 1 + 2n + k.

And so on.

Given that, let's find the coordinates of 2026.

2026 is the first number in layer 23 (since layer 22 ends at 2025).

Layer 23 starts at (23, -23), which is 2026.

So, 2026 is at (23, -23).

Now, its neighbors are:

1. Top: (23, -22)
2. Top-left: (22, -22)
3. Left: (22, -23)
4. Bottom-left: (22, -24)
5. Bottom: (23, -24)
6. Bottom-right: (24, -24)
7. Right: (24, -23)
8. Top-right: (24, -22)

Now, let's find the numbers at these coordinates.

### Calculating Numbers at Neighboring Coordinates

First, let's find the number at (23, -22):

This is on the right side of layer 23, moving up from (23, -23).

The right side of layer n goes from (n, -n) to (n, n), with numbers from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n-1)² + 2n.

So, (23, -23 + k) is (2n-1)² + 1 + k = 2026 + k.

(23, -22) is k=1: 2026 + 1 = 2027.

Similarly:

(22, -22): This is on the top side of layer 22, moving left from (23, -22).

Layer 22 top side: from (22, 22) to (-22, 22), numbers from (43)² + 1 + 2*22 + (22 - 22) = 1849 + 44 + 0 = 1893 to 1893 + 44 = 1937.

Wait, let's find the number at (22, -22):

This is in layer 22, since max(|22|,|-22|) = 22.

The number at (n, -n) is (2n-1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850.

Then, moving up the right side: (n, -n + k) is 1850 + k.

(22, -22 + k) is 1850 + k.

(22, -22) is k=0: 1850.

But we have (22, -22), which is k=0: 1850.

Wait, no: (22, -22) is not on the right side, but on the top side.

The top side is from (n, n) to (-n, n), numbers from (2n-1)² + 2n + 1 to (2n-1)² + 4n.

For layer 22:

Start at (22, 22): (43)² + 2*22 + 1 = 1849 + 44 + 1 = 1894.

Then, moving left: (-22 + k, 22) is 1894 + k.

(22 - k, 22) is 1894 + k.

(22, -22) is not on the top side, but (22, 22) is the start of the top side.

Wait, seems I'm confusing the sides. Let me re-express:

For layer n:

- Right side: (n, -n + k) for k=0 to 2n: numbers (2n-1)² + 1 + k
- Top side: (n - k, n) for k=1 to 2n: numbers (2n-1)² + 2n + 1 + (k-1)
- Left side: (-n, n - k) for k=1 to 2n: numbers (2n-1)² + 4n + 1 + (k-1)
- Bottom side: (-n + k, -n) for k=1 to 2n: numbers (2n-1)² + 6n + 1 + (k-1)

So, (22, -22):

max(|22|,|-22|) = 22, so layer 22.

This is on the left side: (-n, n - k) = (-22, 22 - k) = (22, -22) => -22 = 22 - k => k=44, but k goes up to 2n=44, so k=44.

Number at (-22, -22): (2n-1)² + 4n + 1 + (k-1) = 1849 + 88 + 1 + 43 = 1981.

Wait, let's compute:

(2n-1)² + 4n + 1 + (k-1) = 1849 + 88 + 1 + 43 = 1981.

So, (22, -22) is the same as (-22, 22 - 44) = (-22, -22), which is the last number on the left side: 1981.

Similarly, (22, -23):

This is in layer 22, bottom side: (-n + k, -n) = (-22 + k, -22) = (22, -23) => k=44.

Number at (-22 + 44, -22) = (22, -22): (2n-1)² + 6n + 1 + (k-1) = 1849 + 132 + 1 + 43 = 2025.

But (22, -23) is not on the bottom side, since bottom side is (-n + k, -n), and (22, -23) would require -n + k = 22, -n = -23 => n=23, but layer is 22, so this is not in layer 22.

Wait, seems I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to find the number at (x,y) based on the layer.

Given (x,y), layer n = max(|x|,|y|).

The number at (n, -n) is (2n-1)² + 1.

Then, moving up the right side: (n, -n + k) is (2n-1)² + 1 + k.

Moving left along the top: (n - k, n) is (2n-1)² + 2n + 1 + (k-1).

Moving down the left side: (-n, n - k) is (2n-1)² + 4n + 1 + (k-1).

Moving right along the bottom: (-n + k, -n) is (2n-1)² + 6n + 1 + (k-1).

Now, let's find the numbers at the neighbor coordinates of (23, -23):

1. Top: (23, -22)
   - layer 23, right side: (23, -23 + 1) = (23, -22)
   - number: (45)² + 1 + 1 = 2025 + 1 + 1 = 2027
2. Top-left: (22, -22)
   - layer 22, left side: (-22, 22 - k) = (22, -22) => -22 = 22 - k => k=44
   - number: (43)² + 4*22 + 1 + (44 - 1) = 1849 + 88 + 1 + 43 = 1981
3. Left: (22, -23)
   - layer 22, bottom side: (-22 + k, -22) = (22, -23) => -22 + k = 22 => k=44
   - number: (43)² + 6*22 + 1 + (44 - 1) = 1849 + 132 + 1 + 43 = 2025
4. Bottom-left: (22, -24)
   - layer 23, bottom side: (-23 + k, -23) = (22, -24) => -23 + k = 22 => k=45, but k goes up to 46 (2n=46), so not valid.
   - Alternatively, (22, -24) is in layer 24 (max(|22|,|-24|)=24), but 2026 is in layer 23, so this neighbor is outside the current spiral. Maybe it's not yet assigned a number, but since the spiral is infinite, it's the next number after the last in layer 23.
   - The last number in layer 23 is (47)² = 2209.
   - The first number in layer 24 is 2210.
   - But (22, -24) is not the first in layer 24, so this approach may not work.
   - Maybe it's better to say that (22, -24) is not yet assigned a number in the spiral up to 2026, so it's not a neighbor in the usual sense. But the problem likely assumes the spiral is fully populated, so perhaps we can compute it.
   - Alternatively, since 2026 is at (23, -23), and the spiral is continuous, the number at (22, -24) is the next number after the last in layer 23, which is 2209 + 1 = 2210.
   - But this seems inconsistent with the spiral's numbering. Maybe it's better to find a general formula for (x,y).
5. Bottom: (23, -24)
   - layer 23, bottom side: (-23 + k, -23) = (23, -24) => -23 + k = 23 => k=46
   - number: (45)² + 6*23 + 1 + (46 - 1) = 2025 + 138 + 1 + 45 = 2209
6. Bottom-right: (24, -24)
   - layer 24, first number: (24, -24) is (2*24 -1)² + 1 = 47² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210
7. Right: (24, -23)
   - layer 23, right side: (23, -23 + k) = (24, -23) => not possible, since x is fixed at 23 on right side.
   - Actually, (24, -23) is in layer 24, first number is 2210, then right side is (24, -24 + k), so (24, -23) is k=1: 2210 + 1 = 2211
8. Top-right: (24, -22)
   - layer 24, right side: (24, -24 + k) = (24, -22) => k=2: 2210 + 2 = 2212

But this seems inconsistent because some neighbors are in higher layers than 2026, which may not be intended. Maybe the spiral is only up to 2026, and higher numbers are not yet placed.

Alternatively, perhaps the neighbors are only those that are already placed in the spiral up to 2026.

Given that, let's assume that the spiral is only up to 2026, and any coordinates beyond that are not yet assigned numbers. Then, the neighbors are only those that are within the spiral up to 2026.

From earlier:

1. Top: (23, -22) = 2027
2. Top-left: (22, -22) = 1981
3. Left: (22, -23) = 2025
4. Bottom-left: (22, -24) - not assigned yet
5. Bottom: (23, -24) - not assigned yet
6. Bottom-right: (24, -24) - not assigned yet
7. Right: (24, -23) - not assigned yet
8. Top-right: (24, -22) - not assigned yet

So, the assigned neighbors are 2027, 1981, and 2025.

But the problem asks for all 8 neighbors, implying they are all assigned. Maybe the spiral is infinite, and we can compute the numbers at all neighboring coordinates.

Given that, let's compute all 8 neighbors:

1. Top: (23, -22) = 2027
2. Top-left: (22, -22) = 1981
3. Left: (22, -23) = 2025
4. Bottom-left: (22, -24) = ?
   - This is in layer 24, bottom side: (-24 + k, -24) = (22, -24) => k=46
   - number: (47)² + 6*24 + 1 + (46 - 1) = 2209 + 144 + 1 + 45 = 2399
5. Bottom: (23, -24) = 2209
6. Bottom-right: (24, -24) = 2210
7. Right: (24, -23) = 2211
8. Top-right: (24, -22) = 2212

Now, sum these up:

2027 (top)
+ 1981 (top-left)
+ 2025 (left)
+ 2399 (bottom-left)
+ 2209 (bottom)
+ 2210 (bottom-right)
+ 2211 (right)
+ 2212 (top-right)
= ?

Let's add them step by step:

2027 + 1981 = 4008
4008 + 2025 = 6033
6033 + 2399 = 8432
8432 + 2209 = 10641
10641 + 2210 = 12851
12851 + 2211 = 15062
15062 + 2212 = 17274

### Verifying the Calculation

Let me verify the numbers at each coordinate to ensure correctness.

1. (23, -22): layer 23, right side, k=1: 2026 + 1 = 2027 ✔
2. (22, -22): layer 22, left side, k=44: (43)² + 4*22 + 1 + 43 = 1849 + 88 + 1 + 43 = 1981 ✔
3. (22, -23): layer 22, bottom side, k=44: (43)² + 6*22 + 1 + 43 = 1849 + 132 + 1 + 43 = 2025 ✔
4. (22, -24): layer 24, bottom side, k=46: (47)² + 6*24 + 1 + 45 = 2209 + 144 + 1 + 45 = 2399 ✔
5. (23, -24): layer 23, bottom side, k=46: (45)² + 6*23 + 1 + 45 = 2025 + 138 + 1 + 45 = 2209 ✔
6. (24, -24): layer 24, first number: (47)² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210 ✔
7. (24, -23): layer 24, right side, k=1: 2210 + 1 = 2211 ✔
8. (24, -22): layer 24, right side, k=2: 2210 + 2 = 2212 ✔

The numbers seem correct. Now, summing them:

2027 + 1981 = 4008
4008 + 2025 = 6033
6033 + 2399 = 8432
8432 + 2209 = 10641
10641 + 2210 = 12851
12851 + 2211 = 15062
15062 + 2212 = 17274

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **17274**.
