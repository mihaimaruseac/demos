Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this grid.

### Understanding the Spiral Structure

First, let's understand how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. The given example shows a small portion of the spiral:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that:
- The number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers increase as we move outward in a counter-clockwise spiral: 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 9 in this small example.

To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine its position in the spiral and then identify the numbers that surround it.

### Determining the Position of 2026 in the Spiral

To find the position of 2026, let's think about how numbers are placed in the spiral. The spiral starts at 1 in the center, and each complete "ring" or "layer" around the center contains numbers up to certain squares.

Here's how the layers work:
- Layer 0: Just the number 1 (center).
- Layer 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (forms a 3x3 square around the center).
- Layer 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (forms a 5x5 square).
- Layer 3: Numbers 26 to 49 (forms a 7x7 square).
- And so on...

In general, the nth layer (starting from n=0) contains numbers from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)². The side length of the square for the nth layer is 2n + 1.

Let's find out which layer 2026 is in.

First, find the smallest odd square greater than 2026:
- 43² = 1849
- 45² = 2025
- 47² = 2209

2025 is 45², which is (2*22 + 1)², so 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer (since layer numbering starts from 0).

Wait, let's clarify the layer numbering:
- Layer 0: 1 (1x1)
- Layer 1: 2 to 9 (3x3)
- Layer 2: 10 to 25 (5x5)
- ...
- Layer n: (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)²

So, (2n+1)² is the last number in layer n.

We have 45² = 2025, which is (2*22 + 1)², so 2025 is the last number in layer 22. Therefore, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Position of the First Number in a Layer

The first number in layer n is (2n-1)² + 1. For layer 23:
(2*23 - 1)² + 1 = 45² + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026.

The first number in a layer is always positioned to the right of the bottom-right corner of the previous square.

For layer 23, the previous square is 45x45 (layer 22), so the first number in layer 23 is at position (23, -22) if we consider the center at (0,0). But let's define coordinates more carefully.

Let's define the center (number 1) at (0,0). Then:
- Right is +x, up is +y.
- The first number in layer n is at (n, -(n-1)).

For layer 23:
First number is at (23, -22).

But let's confirm with smaller layers:
- Layer 1: first number is 2 at (1,0).
- Layer 2: first number is 10 at (2,-1).
- Layer 3: first number is 26 at (3,-2).
So the pattern is (n, -(n-1)).

Thus, 2026 is at (23, -22).

### Finding Neighbors of 2026

Now, we need to find the eight neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22). The neighbors are at:
1. (23+1, -22) = (24, -22)
2. (23+1, -22+1) = (24, -21)
3. (23, -22+1) = (23, -21)
4. (23-1, -22+1) = (22, -21)
5. (23-1, -22) = (22, -22)
6. (23-1, -22-1) = (22, -23)
7. (23, -22-1) = (23, -23)
8. (23+1, -22-1) = (24, -23)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

### Determining Numbers at Given Positions

To find the number at a given position, we need to understand how the spiral assigns numbers to positions.

The spiral moves in the order: right, up, left, down, increasing the step length every two turns.

For a given position (x,y), we can determine the layer it's in by max(|x|, |y|). The layer n is max(|x|, |y|).

The number at (x,y) can be found by:
1. Determine the layer n = max(|x|, |y|).
2. The last number in the previous layer is (2n-1)².
3. The side length of the current layer is 2n + 1.
4. The first number in the current layer is (2n-1)² + 1.
5. Then, we can find the number by moving along the spiral from the first number.

This is a bit involved, so let's find a better way.

Alternatively, we can observe that the first number in layer n is at (n, -(n-1)), and the spiral moves up, left, down, right, with step lengths increasing by 1 every two turns.

But calculating the exact number for arbitrary (x,y) is complex. Instead, let's find the numbers around 2026 by seeing how the spiral progresses from 2026.

### Spiral Progression Around 2026

2026 is the first number in layer 23, at (23, -22).

The sequence in layer 23:
1. Start at (23, -22) = 2026
2. Move up 45 steps (since side length is 45): (23, -22 + 45) = (23, 23) = 2026 + 44 = 2070
   - Wait, no: first move is up, but the first number is already at the start, so the next numbers are:
   - 2026 at (23, -22)
   - Then move up: next 44 numbers are (23, -21) to (23, 22) = 2027 to 2070
3. Then move left 45 steps: (22, 22) to (-22, 22) = 2071 to 2115
4. Then move down 46 steps: (-22, 21) to (-22, -23) = 2116 to 2161
5. Then move right 46 steps: (-21, -23) to (23, -23) = 2162 to 2207

Now, let's find the neighbors:

Neighbors of (23, -22):
1. (24, -22): This is in layer 24 (since max(24,22)=24). The first number in layer 24 is (2*24 -1)² + 1 = 47² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210. But (24, -22) is the first position in layer 24, so it's 2210.
2. (24, -21): Next in layer 24, so 2211.
3. (23, -21): This is in layer 23, and is the first number after 2026, so 2027.
4. (22, -21): In layer 22, but let's see: layer 22 goes up to 45²=2025. So (22, -21) is in layer 22. The first number in layer 22 is (2*22 -1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850. The position (22, -21) is the last in the left move of layer 22. The sequence in layer 22:
   - Start at (22, -21) = 1850
   - Up to (22, 21) = 1850 + 42 = 1892
   - Left to (-21, 21) = 1893 + 42 = 1935
   - Down to (-21, -22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979
   - Right to (22, -22) = 1980 + 43 = 2023
   - Then next is (23, -22) = 2026
   So (22, -21) is 2023 - (22 - (-21)) = 2023 - 43 = 1980? Wait, no, let's count from the end:
   - (22, -22) = 2023
   - (21, -22) = 2024
   - (20, -22) = 2025
   - (19, -22) to (-22, -22) = 2026 is at (23, -22), so (-22, -22) is 2025 - (22 - (-22)) = 2025 - 44 = 1981
   This seems messy. Maybe better to find the number at (22, -21):
   In layer 22, the sequence is:
   - Start at (22, -21) = 1850
   - Up to (22, 21) = 1850 + 42 = 1892
   - Left to (-21, 21) = 1893 + 42 = 1935
   - Down to (-21, -22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979
   - Right to (22, -22) = 1980 + 43 = 2023
   So (22, -21) is 1850 + (21 - (-21)) = 1850 + 42 = 1892? Wait, no, the up move is from (22, -21) to (22, 21), which is 42 steps (since (22, -21) is already the first), so (22, -20) is 1851, ..., (22, 21) is 1850 + 42 = 1892.
   So (22, -21) is 1850.
   But earlier, (22, -22) is 2023, which is after moving right from (-21, -22) to (22, -22), which is 43 steps: 1979 + 43 = 2022, but (22, -22) is 2023, so seems off by one.
   Maybe the first number is at (n, -(n-1)), so layer 22 starts at (22, -21) = 1850, then up to (22, 21) = 1850 + 42 = 1892, left to (-21, 21) = 1893 + 42 = 1935, down to (-21, -22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979, right to (22, -22) = 1980 + 43 = 2023.
   So (22, -21) is 1850.
5. (22, -22): From above, 2023.
6. (22, -23): This is in layer 23, at the end of the down move. Layer 23:
   - Start at (23, -22) = 2026
   - Up to (23, 23) = 2026 + 44 = 2070
   - Left to (-22, 23) = 2071 + 44 = 2115
   - Down to (-22, -23) = 2116 + 45 = 2161
   - Right to (23, -23) = 2162 + 45 = 2207
   So (22, -23) is the second last in the down move: (-22, -23) is 2161, so (-21, -23) is 2160, ..., (22, -23) is 2161 - (22 - (-22)) = 2161 - 44 = 2117.
7. (23, -23): From above, 2207.
8. (24, -23): In layer 24, first number is 2210 at (24, -23), so this is 2210.

Wait, let's list the neighbors with their numbers:
1. (24, -22): 2210
2. (24, -21): 2211
3. (23, -21): 2027
4. (22, -21): 1850
5. (22, -22): 2023
6. (22, -23): 2117
7. (23, -23): 2207
8. (24, -23): 2210

Now, let's check for duplicates: (24, -22) and (24, -23) are both 2210, which seems incorrect. Maybe (24, -23) is the first in layer 24, which is 2210, and (24, -22) is next, so 2211.

Similarly, (22, -21) is 1850, (22, -22) is 2023, (22, -23) is 2117.

Let me recount layer 22:
- Start at (22, -21) = 1850
- Up to (22, 21) = 1850 + 42 = 1892
- Left to (-21, 21) = 1893 + 42 = 1935
- Down to (-21, -22) = 1936 + 43 = 1979
- Right to (22, -22) = 1980 + 43 = 2023
So (22, -21) is 1850, (22, -22) is 2023.

Layer 23:
- Start at (23, -22) = 2026
- Up to (23, 23) = 2026 + 44 = 2070
- Left to (-22, 23) = 2071 + 44 = 2115
- Down to (-22, -23) = 2116 + 45 = 2161
- Right to (23, -23) = 2162 + 45 = 2207
So (23, -21) is 2027, (23, -23) is 2207.

Layer 24:
- Start at (24, -23) = 2210
- Up to (24, 24) = 2210 + 46 = 2256
So (24, -22) is 2210 + 1 = 2211, (24, -21) is 2212.

So corrected neighbors:
1. (24, -22): 2211
2. (24, -21): 2212
3. (23, -21): 2027
4. (22, -21): 1850
5. (22, -22): 2023
6. (22, -23): 2117
7. (23, -23): 2207
8. (24, -23): 2210

Now, sum these:
2211 + 2212 + 2027 + 1850 + 2023 + 2117 + 2207 + 2210

Let's add step by step:
2211 + 2212 = 4423
4423 + 2027 = 6450
6450 + 1850 = 8300
8300 + 2023 = 10323
10323 + 2117 = 12440
12440 + 2207 = 14647
14647 + 2210 = 16857

### Verifying the Sum

Let me verify the addition:
2211
+2212 = 4423
+2027 = 6450
+1850 = 8300
+2023 = 10323
+2117 = 12440
+2207 = 14647
+2210 = 16857

The sum checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **16,857**.
