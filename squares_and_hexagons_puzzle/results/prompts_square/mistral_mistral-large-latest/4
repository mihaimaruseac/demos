Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this grid.

### Understanding the Spiral Structure

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. The given example shows a small portion of the spiral:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that:
- The number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers increase as we move outward in a counter-clockwise direction: 1, then 2 to the right, 3 above, 4 above-left, 5 above-left, etc.

This is similar to the "Ulam spiral," where numbers spiral out from the center.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. This involves figuring out which "ring" or "layer" the number is in and its exact coordinates within that ring.

**Defining Rings:**
- The center is ring 0, containing only the number 1.
- Ring 1 contains numbers 2 through 9 (8 numbers).
- Ring 2 contains numbers 10 through 25 (16 numbers).
- Generally, ring `n` contains numbers from `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`, totaling `8n` numbers.

**Finding the Ring for 2026:**
Let's find the smallest `n` such that `(2n+1)^2 >= 2026`.

Calculate squares:
- `n=22`: `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
- `n=23`: `(2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209`

So, 2026 is in ring 23 because `45^2 = 2025` is just before 2026, and `47^2 = 2209` is after.

**Position within the Ring:**
Ring 23 starts at `45^2 + 1 = 2026`. So, 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

In the spiral, the first number of a ring is always located to the right of the bottom-right corner of the previous square. For ring `n`, the first number is at position `(n, -n + 1)` if we consider the center at `(0,0)`.

But let's define coordinates more carefully. Let's assume:
- The center (1) is at `(0,0)`.
- The first number after 1 is 2 at `(1,0)`.
- Then 3 at `(1,1)`, 4 at `(0,1)`, 5 at `(-1,1)`, etc.

For ring `n`, the first number is at `(n, -n + 1)`.

So for ring 23, first number 2026 is at `(23, -22)`.

### Determining the Neighbors

Now, we need to find all eight neighbors of `(23, -22)`. The neighbors are at positions:
1. `(23+1, -22)` = `(24, -22)`
2. `(23+1, -22+1)` = `(24, -21)`
3. `(23, -22+1)` = `(23, -21)`
4. `(23-1, -22+1)` = `(22, -21)`
5. `(23-1, -22)` = `(22, -22)`
6. `(23-1, -22-1)` = `(22, -23)`
7. `(23, -22-1)` = `(23, -23)`
8. `(23+1, -22-1)` = `(24, -23)`

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

### Finding Numbers at Given Positions

To find the number at a given position `(x, y)`, we can use the following approach:

1. Determine the ring `n` the position is in: `n = max(|x|, |y|)`.
2. The first number in ring `n` is `(2(n-1)+1)^2 + 1 = (2n - 1)^2 + 1`.
3. The numbers in ring `n` are arranged in four sides (right, top, left, bottom), each of length `2n`.

Let's find the numbers at each neighbor position.

**Neighbor 1: (24, -22)**
- `n = max(24, 22) = 24`
- First number in ring 24: `(2*24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210`
- Position is on the right side (since `x = n`, `y` from `-n+1` to `n`).
- The right side goes from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)`.
- `(24, -22)` is the second position on the right side (since `-22 = -24 + 2`).
- So, number = 2210 + 1 = 2211

Wait, let's clarify the numbering within a side:
Each side has `2n` numbers. The right side starts at `(n, -n+1)` with the first number, then increments as we go up.

So for `(24, -22)`:
- `-22 = -24 + 2`, so it's the 2nd number on the right side.
- Number = 2210 + 1 = 2211

**Neighbor 2: (24, -21)**
- On the right side, `-21 = -24 + 3`, so 3rd number.
- Number = 2210 + 2 = 2212

**Neighbor 3: (23, -21)**
- `n = max(23, 21) = 23`
- First number in ring 23: `(2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`
- Position is on the top side (since `y = n`, `x` from `n` down to `-n`).
- Top side goes from `(n, n)` to `(-n, n)`.
- `(23, -21)` is not on the top side because `y = -21 != 23`. Wait, no, `n=23`, `y=-21` is not `n` or `-n`, so this is not on a corner or side where `x` or `y` is `±n`.

Hmm, seems I made a mistake in identifying the side. Let me re-examine.

For `(23, -21)`:
- `n = 23`
- First number in ring 23: 2026 at `(23, -22)`
- The ring starts at `(23, -22)` (right side), goes up to `(23, 23)`, then left to `(-23, 23)`, then down to `(-23, -23)`, then right to `(23, -23)`.
- `(23, -21)` is on the right side, one above `(23, -22)`.
- So it's the second number on the right side.
- Number = 2026 + 1 = 2027

**Neighbor 4: (22, -21)**
- `n = max(22, 21) = 22`
- First number in ring 22: `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`
- Position is on the top side (since `y = -21` is not `±22`, but `x` is decreasing from `n` to `-n`).
Wait, no, `n=22`, `y=-21` is not `±22`, so not on top or bottom.
Actually, `(22, -21)` is on the left side of ring 22, because `x` is decreasing from `n` to `-n` while `y` is `n-1`.
Wait, let's think differently.

For ring `n`, the sides are:
1. Right: `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, n)` - `2n` numbers
2. Top: `(n-1, n)` to `(-n, n)` - `2n` numbers
3. Left: `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)` - `2n` numbers
4. Bottom: `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)` - `2n` numbers

`(22, -21)`:
- `n=22`
- `x=22`, `y=-21`
- `y = -21 = -22 + 1`, so it's on the bottom side.
- Bottom side goes from `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)`.
- `(22, -21)` is `(n, -n + 1)`, which is the second position on the bottom side.
- First number on bottom side is `( -21, -22 )` with number `1850 + 6n - 3 = 1850 + 132 - 3 = 1979` (this seems complicated; maybe better to count from the start of the side).

Alternative approach: the bottom side starts at `(-n+1, -n)` with number `first_number + 6n - 1` (since right, top, left are `2n` each, totaling `6n` before bottom).
Wait, no, first number is at `(n, -n+1)`, then right side `2n`, top `2n`, left `2n`, then bottom `2n`.
So bottom starts at `first_number + 6n`.
But first number is `(2n-1)^2 + 1`, so bottom starts at `(2n-1)^2 + 1 + 6n`.
For `n=22`: `43^2 + 1 + 132 = 1849 + 1 + 132 = 1982`
Then `( -21, -22 )` is first on bottom, `( -20, -22 )` second, ..., `(22, -22)` is last.
`(22, -21)` is `(n, -n + 1)`, which is the second to last on the bottom side.
Number = `1982 + 2n - 2 = 1982 + 44 - 2 = 2024`

Wait, let's count:
Bottom side: `(-21, -22)` to `(22, -22)` - 44 numbers (from -21 to 22 is 44 steps).
`(22, -21)` is `(n, -n + 1)`, which is the second position from the end (since `(22, -22)` is last).
So number = `1982 + 44 - 2 = 2024`

**Neighbor 5: (22, -22)**
- `n=22`
- `(22, -22)` is the last on the bottom side.
- Number = `1982 + 44 - 1 = 2025`

**Neighbor 6: (22, -23)**
- `n = max(22, 23) = 23`
- First number in ring 23: 2026 at `(23, -22)`
- `(22, -23)` is on the left side (since `x` is decreasing from `n` to `-n`, `y` is `-n`).
- Left side goes from `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)`.
- `(22, -23)` is not on the left side because `x=22 != -23`.
Wait, `n=23`, `y=-23 = -n`, so it's on the bottom side of ring 23.
But ring 23 starts at `(23, -22)`, so bottom side is from `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)`.
`(22, -23)` is second to last on the bottom side.
Number = 2026 + 6*23 + (from -22 to 22 is 45 steps, but bottom side is 2n=46 numbers)
Wait, first number is 2026 at `(23, -22)`.
Right side: `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)` - 46 numbers (2026 to 2071)
Top side: `(22, 23)` to `(-23, 23)` - 46 numbers (2072 to 2117)
Left side: `(-23, 22)` to `(-23, -23)` - 46 numbers (2118 to 2163)
Bottom side: `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)` - 46 numbers (2164 to 2209)
`(22, -23)` is second to last on bottom side, so number = 2209 - 1 = 2208

Wait, no, bottom side starts at `(-22, -23)` with 2164, then increments as we move right.
`(22, -23)` is 44th position (from -22 to 22 is 44 steps), so number = 2164 + 44 = 2208

**Neighbor 7: (23, -23)**
- `n=23`
- `(23, -23)` is last on bottom side.
- Number = 2209

**Neighbor 8: (24, -23)**
- `n = max(24, 23) = 24`
- First number in ring 24: 2210 at `(24, -23)`
- `(24, -23)` is the first on the right side.
- Number = 2210

### Listing All Neighbors

Now, let's list all eight neighbors with their numbers:

1. `(24, -22)`: 2211
2. `(24, -21)`: 2212
3. `(23, -21)`: 2027
4. `(22, -21)`: 2024
5. `(22, -22)`: 2025
6. `(22, -23)`: 2208
7. `(23, -23)`: 2209
8. `(24, -23)`: 2210

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum all these numbers:

2211 + 2212 + 2027 + 2024 + 2025 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210

Let's add them step by step:

- 2211 + 2212 = 4423
- 4423 + 2027 = 6450
- 6450 + 2024 = 8474
- 8474 + 2025 = 10499
- 10499 + 2208 = 12707
- 12707 + 2209 = 14916
- 14916 + 2210 = 17126

### Verifying the Sum

Let me verify the addition to ensure no mistakes:

2211 + 2212 = 4423
4423 + 2027 = 6450
6450 + 2024 = 8474
8474 + 2025 = 10499
10499 + 2208 = 12707
12707 + 2209 = 14916
14916 + 2210 = 17126

The sum checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **17126**.
