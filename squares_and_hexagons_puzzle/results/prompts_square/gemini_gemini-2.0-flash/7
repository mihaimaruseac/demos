Let the spiral start with the number 1 at the center. We can represent the spiral as a sequence of squares centered at the origin, with side lengths 1, 3, 5, 7, ... . The $n$th square has side length $2n-1$.
The number of elements in the $n$th square is $(2n-1)^2$.
So the numbers in the sequence are $1, 9, 25, 49, \dots$
The difference between consecutive squares is $8, 16, 24, \dots$, which is $8n$.

To find the layer of the number 2026, we want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \ge 2026$.
$2n-1 \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
$2n-1 \ge 45$ implies $2n \ge 46$, so $n \ge 23$.
Then the $23$rd square has side length $2(23)-1 = 45$, and the total number of elements is $45^2 = 2025$.
The $22$nd square has side length $2(22)-1 = 43$, and the total number of elements is $43^2 = 1849$.
So the number 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
The first number in the 23rd layer is 1850.

Let's find the coordinates of the number 1. We call it (0,0).
The number 2 is at (1,0), 3 is at (1,1), 4 is at (0,1), 5 is at (-1,1), 6 is at (-1,0), 7 is at (-1,-1), 8 is at (0,-1), 9 is at (1,-1).
The numbers 1850 to 2025 are in the 23rd layer. The numbers are added starting from the right edge and going counterclockwise.
The right edge is $n, n-1, n-2, \dots$ for $2n-1$ elements.
So the number in the top right corner is $(2n-1)^2 = 2025$, so $2025 = 45^2$.
The top right corner of the 23rd layer is at (22,22).
The number 2025 is at (22,22).
Then 2024 is at (21,22), 2023 is at (20,22), ..., 1896 is at (-22,22).
The next edge has 45 numbers, from 1895 to 1851.
The position of the number 1850 is (-22,-21), and 1851 is (-22,22).

Since 2026 = 1850 + 176, we count from 1850 to 2026.
1850 is at (-22,-21).
The numbers increase as we go around the spiral counterclockwise.
Numbers increase until we get to the corner (22,22), which is 2025.
2026 is then at (22,-23).
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are at:
(21,-24), (22,-24), (23,-24),
(21,-23), (23,-23),
(21,-22), (22,-22), (23,-22).
We need to find the numbers at these locations.
We can use the fact that the numbers increase counterclockwise.

The position (22,-23) corresponds to 2026.
(22,22) = 2025.
Then 2026 is the next number, 2027, 2028, 2029.
(23,22) = 2026, (23,21) = 2027, ..., (23,-22) = 2069
(23,-23) = 2070, (22,-23) = 2026.
We want to find the values at
(21,-24), (22,-24), (23,-24),
(21,-23), (23,-23),
(21,-22), (22,-22), (23,-22).
2070 is at (23,-23).
2071 is at (22,-24).
2072 is at (21,-24).
2073 is at (20,-24).
So, we have 2025 at (22,22).
2026 is at (23,22).
Let $n=23$. Then the $4n = 4(23) = 92$ integers are on the perimeter.
2026 is at position (23, -22).
Let $P = 4(2n-1) = 4(45) = 180$.
Since $P = 8n = 8(23) - 4 = 184-4 = 180$.
1850+176 = 2026
The neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 2070, 2071, 2072, 2073, 2074, 2075
Then we have 2025+2027+2070+2071+2072+2073+2074+2075 = 16387

Let N be the number in the center.
The sum of the neighbors is $8N$. If $N=1$, then 8.
Let the neighbors of 2026 be $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_8$. We want $\sum_{i=1}^8 x_i$.
$2026(8) = 16208$, close to our 16387.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
