Let the numbers be arranged in a spiral in a square grid as given. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026. We first need to determine which layer of the spiral contains 2026. The numbers in the corners of the spiral form a sequence of squares of odd numbers: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ...
The $n$-th corner has the value $(2n-1)^2$. We want to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2$ is close to 2026. We have $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$. So $2n-1 \approx 45$, which gives $2n \approx 46$, so $n \approx 23$.
Let's check the corners $(2(22)-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$ and $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
So 2025 is at the bottom right corner of the 23rd layer. The layer containing 2025 is layer 23. The numbers in this layer are $1849+1, 1849+2, \dots, 2025$.

We know that 2025 is at the bottom right corner. Thus, 2026 is directly to the left of 2025. We can place 2025 and 2026 in the grid as follows:

...
...
... 2027 2028 2029 ...
... 2034 2025 2026 ...
... 2033 2032 2031 ...
...

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2034, 2033, 2032, 2031, 2029, 2028, 2027.
We want to find the sum of these 8 neighbors:
$S = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 + 2034$
$S = 2025 + (2026+1) + (2026+2) + (2026+3) + (2026+5) + (2026+6) + (2026+7) + (2026+8)$
$S = 8(2026) + 1+2+3+5+6+7+8 = 8(2026) + 32 = 16208 + 32 = 16240$.

Alternatively, the sum of the 8 neighbors of a number in the grid is $8$ times the number itself. Let's consider the neighbors of the number 1. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The sum is 44, which is not $8(1) = 8$. This is because 1 is in the center.
Consider the neighbors of 5. They are ..., 6, 1, 2, ..., 4, ..., 8, ...
Consider the neighbors of 2. They are 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 4, 5. Sum is 43, which is not $8(2) = 16$.

The sum of the 8 neighbors of a number $n$ can be written as $n-1, n+1, n+x, n-x, n+x+1, n+x-1, n-x-1, n-x+1$. Their sum is $8n$.
However, this is only true when $n$ is in the middle of the grid.

Let $N$ be 2026. Then the 8 neighbors of $N$ are $N-1, N+1, N-7, N+7, N-8, N+8, N-9, N+9$.
So the sum of the 8 neighbors of $N$ is $8N = 8(2026) = 16208$.

However, the neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034. The numbers are not consecutive.
$2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 + 2034 = 16240$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16240}$
