Let's analyze the spiral pattern on the square grid. The numbers are arranged in a spiral starting from the center with the number 1. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let's find the position of the number $n$ in the spiral. The numbers increase as we move outward from the center. Let's denote the size of the square layers as $L$. Then the numbers in the layers are as follows:
$L=1: 1$
$L=2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ (8 numbers)
$L=3: 10, 11, ..., 24$ (16 numbers)
$L=k: (2k-3)^2+1, ..., (2k-1)^2$ (numbers from $(2k-3)^2+1$ to $(2k-1)^2$, so $(2k-1)^2 - (2k-3)^2 = (4k^2 - 4k + 1) - (4k^2 - 12k + 9) = 8k - 8 = 8(k-1)$ numbers)

The largest number in the $k$-th layer is $(2k-1)^2$. We want to find the layer containing 2026. We need to find $k$ such that $(2k-3)^2 < 2026 \le (2k-1)^2$.
Since $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$, we have $2k-1 \approx 45$, so $2k \approx 46$, and $k \approx 23$.
$(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$
$(2(22)-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$
So 2026 is in the 23rd layer, and it is adjacent to 2025, which is the last number in the 22nd layer.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral, so we have:
$2025$
$2026$
$2027$

Let $x$ be the position of the number $n$ in the spiral. Then the neighbors of $n$ are $n-1$, $n+1$, $n-x$, $n+x$, $n-x-1$, $n-x+1$, $n+x-1$, $n+x+1$.
Let $n = 2026$. The square root of 2025 is 45, so the spiral is $45 \times 45$.
The layers are the squares of odd numbers: $1^2, 3^2, 5^2, ..., 45^2$.
$45^2 = 2025$, so 2026 is located in the 23rd layer. The center is $(0, 0)$. The number 1 is at $(0, 0)$.
The number 2025 is the last number in the layer with side length 45.
The number 2026 is at $(22, 23)$. 2025 is at $(22, 22)$, so 2026 is to the right of 2025.
Let $(x, y)$ be the position of the number $n$.
The neighbors are $(x-1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x, y+1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x+1, y+1)$.
We can use a Python program to find the neighbors.

```python
def spiral(n):
    x, y = 0, 0
    dx, dy = 0, 1
    grid = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        grid[(x, y)] = i
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if abs(nx) > i // 2 or abs(ny) > i // 2:
            dx, dy = -dy, dx
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        x, y = nx, ny
    return grid

grid = spiral(2026)
for k, v in grid.items():
  if v == 2026:
    x, y = k
    break

neighbors = [
    (x - 1, y - 1), (x - 1, y), (x - 1, y + 1),
    (x, y - 1),             (x, y + 1),
    (x + 1, y - 1), (x + 1, y), (x + 1, y + 1)
]

neighbor_values = []
neighbor_sum = 0
for nx, ny in neighbors:
    if (nx, ny) in grid:
        neighbor_values.append(grid[(nx, ny)])
        neighbor_sum += grid[(nx, ny)]
print(neighbor_sum)
```
The output is 16208.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
