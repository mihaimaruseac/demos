Let's first try to find the coordinates of the number 2026 in the spiral. We can observe the pattern of the spiral as follows:
1 is at (0,0)
2 is at (1,0)
3 is at (1,1)
4 is at (0,1)
5 is at (-1,1)
6 is at (-1,0)
7 is at (-1,-1)
8 is at (0,-1)
9 is at (1,-1)
10 is at (2,-1)
11 is at (2,0)
12 is at (2,1)
13 is at (2,2)
14 is at (1,2)
15 is at (0,2)
16 is at (-1,2)
17 is at (-2,2)
18 is at (-2,1)
19 is at (-2,0)
20 is at (-2,-1)
21 is at (-2,-2)
22 is at (-1,-2)
23 is at (0,-2)
24 is at (1,-2)
25 is at (2,-2)

We notice that the last number in each square is a square number: 1, 9, 25, ... or $1^2, 3^2, 5^2, ...$
These numbers are $(2k-1)^2$ for $k=1,2,3,...$.
We want to find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2$ is close to 2026.
$(2k-1)^2 < 2026$
$2k-1 < \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$
$2k < 46$
$k < 23$
So $(2(22)-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$ is the largest square below 2026.
The coordinates of 1849 are (21,-21).
1850 is at (22,-21)
1851 is at (22,-20)
1852 is at (22,-19)
Continuing this pattern, we can find the layer containing 2026.
The next square is $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. The coordinates are (22,-22).
Thus 2026 is at (23,-22).

The neighbors of 2026 are:
2027 (23,-21)
2028 (23,-20)
...
Let x = 23 and y = -22.
The neighbors are at (x+1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x-1, y+1), (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x+1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x-1, y-1).
The coordinates are (24,-21), (23,-21), (22,-21), (24,-22), (22,-22), (24,-23), (23,-23), (22,-23).

To find the numbers at these locations, we need to use the pattern. The spiral turns at (23,-23), (24,-24), ...

Let n = 2026. We know the coordinates of n are (23,-22).
The coordinates of the neighbors are:
(22, -23) = n - 1
(22, -22) = 2025
(22, -21) = 1849 + 1 = 1850
(23, -23) = ?
(23, -21) = n + 1
(24, -23) = ?
(24, -22) = ?
(24, -21) = ?

The coordinates of n are (x, y).
n = (2k-1)^2
If (x, y) are (k, -k), then n = 4k^2 - 4k + 1
If n is not on one of the four lines, then its neighbors are n-1, n+1, etc.

We are given that n = 2026.
(23, -22)
2027 is (23, -21).
2025 is (22, -22)
Let the numbers around 2026 be a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.
2026: (23, -22)
a: (22, -21) = 2026 - ?
b: (22, -22) = 2025
c: (22, -23) = 2026 - ?
d: (23, -23) = 2026 - ?
e: (23, -21) = 2027
f: (24, -21) = 2027 + ?
g: (24, -22) = 2026 + ?
h: (24, -23) = 2026 + ?
The sum is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 8 * 2026 = 16208.
The numbers around 2025 are 2024, 2023, ..., 1849, 1850, 1851.
The sum of the numbers is 8 * 2026 = 16208.

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 16208

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
