Let the spiral start at 1 in the center. The numbers increase in a spiral fashion. We are asked to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

First, we need to find the position of the number 2026 in the spiral.
Since the numbers increase in a spiral fashion, we need to consider the sequence of squares centered at 1:
1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ...
The $n$th square has side length $2n-1$ and has $(2n-1)^2$ numbers.
The $n$th square ends with the number $(2n-1)^2$.
For example:
$n=1$: $(2(1)-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. The spiral is just 1.
$n=2$: $(2(2)-1)^2 = 3^2 = 9$. The numbers are:
5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9
$n=3$: $(2(3)-1)^2 = 5^2 = 25$. The numbers are:
17 16 15 14 13
18 5 4 3 12
19 6 1 2 11
20 7 8 9 10
21 22 23 24 25

We want to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \approx 2026$.
$(2n-1)^2 = 2025 \Rightarrow 2n-1 = \sqrt{2025} = 45 \Rightarrow 2n = 46 \Rightarrow n = 23$.
$(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. So 2025 is the bottom right corner of the 23rd square.

Let's consider the location of 2025 in the 23rd square.
2025 is in the position (23, 23).
The spiral numbers move like this:
$x+1$ (right), $y+1$ (down), $x-1$ (left), $y-1$ (up).
Since 2025 is in the bottom right corner, then 2026 is to the right of 2025.
The coordinates of 2025 are (23, 23). Then the coordinates of 2026 are (24, 23).
To find the coordinates of the number 1, we need to subtract 22 from both x and y.
So the coordinates of 1 are (23-22, 23-22) = (1, 1).

Let $(x,y)$ be the coordinates of 2026.
The coordinates of 2026 are (24, 23).
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
(23, 22), (24, 22), (25, 22), (23, 23), (25, 23), (23, 24), (24, 24), (25, 24).
We have:
2025: (23, 23)
2026: (24, 23)
2027: (25, 23)
2028: (25, 22)
2029: (24, 22)
2030: (23, 22)
2031: (23, 24)
2032: (24, 24)
2033: (25, 24)

Let $n$ be the value at $(x, y)$.
$S = \sum n(x \pm 1, y \pm 1)$.

Since $2026 = 2025 + 1$, the neighbors are $2025, 2027, ...$.
Neighbors of 2026:
Left: 2025
Right: 2027
Up: 2029
Down: 2023
Top-left: 2030
Top-right: 2028
Bottom-left: 2022
Bottom-right: 2024
Sum: 2025+2027+2029+2023+2030+2028+2022+2024 = 16210 + 16 = 16208.
Sum = $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

Let N be the number. The sum of its neighbors is $8N$.

Therefore the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
