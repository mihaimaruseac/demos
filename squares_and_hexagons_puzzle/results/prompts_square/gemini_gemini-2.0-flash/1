Let the spiral start with 1 in the center, which we label as (0, 0).
The pattern of the numbers is:
1 is at (0, 0)
2 is at (1, 0)
3 is at (1, 1)
4 is at (0, 1)
5 is at (-1, 1)
6 is at (-1, 0)
7 is at (-1, -1)
8 is at (0, -1)
9 is at (1, -1)
10 is at (2, -1)
11 is at (2, 0)
12 is at (2, 1)
13 is at (2, 2)

In general, let $n$ be the $k$th square, i.e., $n = (2k-1)^2$. Then the coordinate of $n$ is $(k-1, -(k-1))$. The next number $n+1$ is at $(k, -(k-1))$.
The length of the $k$th side is $2k-1$. The spiral progresses by first going right, then up, then left, then down.
The number 2026 is close to $45^2 = 2025$. So $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011$.
So we can assume that 2025 is on the south-east side of the spiral.
$45 = 2k - 1$, so $k = 23$. The position of 2025 is $(22, -22)$.
We have $2025 = (45)^2$, which is at $(22, -22)$.
Then 2026 is at $(23, -22)$.
The neighbors are:
(22, -23) = 2025 - 45 - 1 = 1979
(23, -23) = 2025 - 45 = 1980
(24, -23) = 2025 - 44 = 1981
(24, -22) = 2027
(24, -21) = 2028
(23, -21) = 2029
(22, -21) = 2025 + 46 = 2071
(22, -22) = 2025
Then the sum of the neighbors is
1979 + 1980 + 1981 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2071 + 2025 = 16120

Let $n$ be the number we are interested in.
$n = 2026$.
$45^2 = 2025$. $n$ is at $(23, -22)$.
$n-1 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The neighbors are
$n-46, n-45, n-44, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+45, n-1$.
$n-46 = 2026 - 46 = 1980$
$n-45 = 2026 - 45 = 1981$
$n-44 = 2026 - 44 = 1982$
$n+1 = 2027$
$n+2 = 2028$
$n+3 = 2029$
$n+45 = 2026 + 45 = 2071$
$n-1 = 2025$
Sum = $1980 + 1981 + 1982 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2071 + 2025 = 16123$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16120}$
