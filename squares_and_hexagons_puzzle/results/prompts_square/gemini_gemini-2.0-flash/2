Let $n$ be the central number. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of $n=2026$.
Let the neighbors of $n$ be $n_1, n_2, n_3, ..., n_8$.
Then $S = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + ... + n_8$.
We can observe that the spiral is constructed by starting at the center with 1 and spiraling outwards. The numbers increase in order.
The coordinates of the numbers in the spiral can be described as follows:
1 is at (0,0)
2 is at (1,0)
3 is at (1,1)
4 is at (0,1)
5 is at (-1,1)
6 is at (-1,0)
7 is at (-1,-1)
8 is at (0,-1)
9 is at (1,-1)

Let the coordinates of $n$ be $(x,y)$. Then the coordinates of the neighbors are:
$(x-1, y-1)$
$(x-1, y)$
$(x-1, y+1)$
$(x, y-1)$
$(x, y+1)$
$(x+1, y-1)$
$(x+1, y)$
$(x+1, y+1)$
The sum of the neighbors is $S = (n-a) + (n-b) + (n-c) + (n-d) + (n+e) + (n+f) + (n+g) + (n+h)$
We want to find a general formula for the sum of the neighbors of $n$.

Consider a 3x3 grid with $n$ in the center.
$$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline n-a & n-b & n-c \\ \hline n-d & n & n+e \\ \hline n-f & n-g & n-h \\ \hline \end{array} $$
We want to find $S = n-a + n-b + n-c + n-d + n+e + n+f + n+g + n+h = 8n + (e+f+g+h-a-b-c-d)$.
When $n=1$, $S = 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44$. But $8n=8$, so $S=8+36=44$.
Let's try $n=2$. The neighbors are 1,3,4,6,8,7,6,1. The correct neighbors are 1,3,4,6,7,8,1,3.
Sum of neighbors is $1+3+4+1+6+7+8+3 = 33$
However, the numbers 1,2,3,... form a spiral. The sum of the 8 neighbors is not always the same.
Consider the neighbors of 1 to be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. $S = 44$. $8(1) = 8$, $44 - 8 = 36$.
However, consider the neighbors of 9 to be 2,1,6,5,4,3,2,1. This is not the correct.
We are given that the neighbors are consecutive integers around 2026.
So the neighbors are roughly $2026-4, 2026-3, ..., 2026+4$.
The numbers will be close to the central number. Thus, we can say the neighbors are close to $n$.
Let $n = 2026$. Then $8n = 8 \cdot 2026 = 16208$.
Consider the neighbors of 1: $S = 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44$.
Let us approximate the sum of the neighbors of 2026 to be roughly $2026 \pm 4$, so $2022 \le x \le 2030$.
Let $n_i$ be the neighbor of 2026, so $n_i \approx 2026$.
Let's assume the average difference between the neighbors and 2026 is roughly 0.
Then $S = 8n + (e+f+g+h-a-b-c-d) \approx 8n = 8(2026) = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
