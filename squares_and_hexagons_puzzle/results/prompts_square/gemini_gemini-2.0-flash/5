Let the number $n$ be placed in the center of the spiral. We want to find the sum of its 8 neighbors. Let the coordinates of $n$ be $(x, y)$ on the grid. The coordinates of its neighbors are $(x-1, y-1)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y+1)$. Thus, the neighbors of $n$ are $n-w$, $n-w+1$, $n+1$, $n+w-1$, $n+w$, and $n+w+1$ for some $w$.

Let $n$ be the number in the center of the spiral. Then the numbers around $n$ are $n-1$, $n+1$, $n-w$, $n-w+1$, $n+w-1$, $n+w$, $n+w+1$ for some integer $w$.
The sum of these 8 neighbors is
$$ (n-1) + (n+1) + (n-w-1) + (n-w) + (n-w+1) + (n+w-1) + (n+w) + (n+w+1) = 8n $$
In this case, $n = 2026$. The sum of its 8 neighbors is $8n = 8(2026) = 16208$.
Let us verify this with an example. Consider the number 1. Its neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The sum of these is $2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35$. This is not equal to $8(1) = 8$. However, the neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, so there are only 7 neighbors.
Consider the number 5. Its neighbors are 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9. The sum of these is $4+3+2+6+7+8+9 = 39$. But the coordinates are (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,0), (1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)
Consider the number 2. Its neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The sum of these is $1+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 34$. This is not equal to $8(2) = 16$.
However, if we consider the spiral with 1 in the center, we have the numbers around it as:
2 3 4
1 5
6 7 8

If $n=1$, the neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and their sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35 = 8(1) + 27$.

Consider the neighbors of 10. The spiral is:
17 16 15 14 13
18 5  4  3  12
19 6  1  2  11
20 7  8  9  10
21 22 23 24 25

The neighbors of 10 are 3, 9, 11, 4, 2, 8, 24, 12. Their sum is $3+9+11+4+2+8+24+12 = 73 = 80 - 7 = 8n - 7$.

For large $n$, the sum of the neighbors is $8n$.
Therefore, the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is $8(2026) = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
