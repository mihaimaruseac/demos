Let the number 1 be at the center of the spiral. The numbers around the center form the first layer, which contains $8 = 8 \cdot 1$ numbers.
The next layer contains $16 = 8 \cdot 2$ numbers.
In general, the $n$-th layer contains $8n$ numbers. The largest number in the $n$-th layer is $(2n+1)^2$.
We are looking for the layer containing 2026.
We want to find $n$ such that $(2n+1)^2 \ge 2026$.
$2n+1 \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
$2n \ge 44$, so $n \ge 22$.
$(2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
Therefore, the number 2025 is the largest number in the 22nd layer.
Since 2026 is greater than 2025, it must be in the 23rd layer.
So $n = 23$.
The largest number in the 23rd layer is $(2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$.
Let $x$ and $y$ be the coordinates of the number 1. Then $x=0$ and $y=0$.
The coordinates of 2025 are $(22, 22)$.
Since 2026 is the next number after 2025, it must be located at $(23, 22)$.
The neighbors of the number 2026 are:
$(22, 21)$ contains 2024
$(23, 21)$ contains $2026+1=2027$
$(24, 21)$ contains $2026+2=2028$
$(24, 22)$ contains $2026+3=2029$
$(24, 23)$ contains $2026+4=2030$
$(23, 23)$ contains $2026+5=2031$
$(22, 23)$ contains $2026-1=2025$
$(22, 22)$ contains 2023

However, the numbers are decreasing along the sides of the square spiral.
Let us analyze the numbers around 1.
2 3 4
1 8
6 7 6
The neighbors of 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Their sum is $2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35$.
$35 = 8 \cdot 1 + 27$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the neighbors of 2026. Then
$S = (2026-1) + (2026+1) + (2026+2) + (2026+3) + (2026+4) + (2026+5) + (2026+6) + (2026-n)$
Consider the neighbors of the number $k$ in the $n$-th layer. Then the sum is approximately $8k$.
We need to find the position of 2026.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, we know that 2025 is located at the corner of the 22nd layer.
The 22nd layer is $x=22, y=22$.
Since 2026 is just to the right of 2025, 2026 is at $(23, 22)$.
The neighbors are at $(22, 21), (23, 21), (24, 21), (24, 22), (24, 23), (23, 23), (22, 23), (22, 22)$.
Consider the neighbors of 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Their sum is 35.
2026 is located on the edge. 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, ...
Numbers decrease in the lower left.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2023, 2028, 2030, 2031, 2029, 2024.
$2025+2027+2023+2028+2030+2031+2029+2024 = 16217$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
