Let's consider the spiral arrangement of natural numbers:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

We want to find the sum of the eight neighbors of the number 2026. We need to determine the row and column position of the number 2026 in the spiral. We can think of the spiral as layers surrounding the number 1.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 numbers)
Layer 3: 10, 11, ..., 24 (16 numbers)
Layer $n$ has $8(n-1)$ numbers for $n > 1$.
The last number in layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} 8(i-1) = 1 + 8\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = 1 + 8 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 4n(n-1) = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 = (2n-1)^2$.
We want to find the layer $n$ where 2026 lies. We need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \approx 2026$.
$2n-1 \approx \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$
$2n \approx 46.01$
$n \approx 23.005$
The last number in layer 22 is $(2(22)-1)^2 = (44-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$.
The last number in layer 23 is $(2(23)-1)^2 = (46-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
The number 2025 is in layer 23. The numbers in layer 23 are 1850, 1851, ..., 2025.

Since $2025 = 45^2$, the number 2025 is at the bottom right corner of the square grid.
2026 is to the right of 2025, so 2025 is at position $(23, 23)$.
The number 2026 is the first number in layer 24, i.e., 2026 is to the right of 2025.
2025 is at position (23, 23). 2026 is at position (23, 24).

The neighbors of 2025 are:
Left: 2024
Right: 2026
Up: 2024 - 44 = 1981
Down: 2026 + 46 = 2071
Up-Left: 1981 - 1 = 1980
Up-Right: 1981 + 1 = 1982
Down-Left: 2071 - 1 = 2070
Down-Right: 2071 + 1 = 2072
2025 is at (23, 23).

2025 is at (23, 23). Then 2026 is at (24, 23).
If we let (0, 0) be the location of 1, then 2025 is at (22, -22). 2026 is to its right at (23, -22).
Let (r, c) be the coordinates of 2026.
Then the 8 neighbors are:
(r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1)
(r, c-1), (r, c+1)
(r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1)
We know 2025 is at position (23, 23). Then 2026 is at (24, 23).
2026 is at (r, c) = (24, 23).
The eight neighbors are:
2026 - 1 = 2025
2026 + 1 = 2027
2026 - 46 = 1980
2026 + 46 = 2072
We know the last number in layer $n$ is $(2n-1)^2$. The $k^{th}$ number in layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} 8(i-1) + k$.
If $2026 = 1 + 4n(n-1) + k$, we need to find the layer $n$.
$n = 23$ and the last number is $2025$. So $n=24$.
We are looking for the number in layer 23. $2026 = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{23} 8(i-1) + k$.
$2026 = 1 + 4(23)(22) + k = 1 + 4(506) + k = 2025 + k$.
So $2026 = 2025 + 1$, so $k = 1$. 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer.
2026 is to the right of 2025.
Since 2025 is at (23, 23), 2026 is at (23, 24).
Then the neighbors are:
Top left: 2026 - 47
Top: 2026 - 46
Top right: 2026 - 45
Left: 2026 - 1 = 2025
Right: 2026 + 1 = 2027
Bottom left: 2026 + 45
Bottom: 2026 + 46
Bottom right: 2026 + 47

The numbers 2026 is surrounded by 8 neighbors. The sum of neighbors is:
$\sum = (2026 - 47) + (2026 - 46) + (2026 - 45) + (2026 - 1) + (2026 + 1) + (2026 + 45) + (2026 + 46) + (2026 + 47)$
$= 8(2026) + (-47 - 46 - 45 - 1 + 1 + 45 + 46 + 47) = 8(2026) + 0 = 8(2026) = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
