## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid, with each number being surrounded by four other numbers in the same row and column.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 in the grid. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact position of the number 2026.

## Step 3: Analyze the pattern of the spiral
The spiral pattern of the numbers suggests that each number is surrounded by four other numbers in the same row and column. The numbers in the same row and column as 2026 will be its neighbors.

## Step 4: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026
Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact position of the number 2026, we cannot directly identify its neighbors. However, we can analyze the pattern of the spiral to determine the possible positions of the neighbors.

## Step 5: Consider the possible positions of the neighbors
Given the spiral pattern, the neighbors of 2026 can be in one of the following positions: (1) directly above, (2) directly below, (3) directly to the left, or (4) directly to the right of 2026.

## Step 6: Analyze the pattern of the spiral to determine the sum of the neighbors
The spiral pattern suggests that the numbers are increasing in a clockwise direction. This means that the numbers above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026 will be increasing in value as we move around the spiral.

## Step 7: Consider the sum of the neighbors
Since the numbers are increasing in value as we move around the spiral, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 will be the sum of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026, plus the numbers in the four adjacent positions.

## Step 8: Analyze the pattern of the spiral to determine the sum of the neighbors
Given the spiral pattern, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 will be the sum of the numbers in the same row and column as 2026, plus the numbers in the four adjacent positions. Since the numbers are increasing in value as we move around the spiral, the sum of the neighbors will be a multiple of 3.

## Step 9: Consider the sum of the neighbors of 2026
Since the numbers are increasing in value as we move around the spiral, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 will be a multiple of 3.

## Step 10: Determine the sum of the neighbors of 2026
Based on the pattern of the spiral, the sum of the neighbors of 2026 will be 3 times the value of 2026 minus 2026.

## Step 11: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is 3 * 2026 - 2026.

## Step 12: Simplify the expression
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is 3 * 2026 - 2026 = 6068 - 2026.

## Step 13: Calculate the final answer
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is 6068 - 2026 = 4042.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4042}$
