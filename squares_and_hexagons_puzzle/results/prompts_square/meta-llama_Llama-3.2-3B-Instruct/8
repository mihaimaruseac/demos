## Step 1: Understand the layout and identify the number 2026's position
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid, with the first row starting from 1 and increasing in a clockwise spiral. To identify the position of 2026, we need to recognize its place in the sequence. The numbers in each row increase by 1, and the sequence wraps around when it reaches the end of a row.

## Step 2: Determine the row and column of 2026
Given the spiral pattern, we need to find which row and column 2026 occupies. Since the pattern starts from 1 and increases in a spiral, we can calculate the row and column by dividing 2026 by the number of elements in a row. The first row has 3 elements, the second row has 4 elements, and so on. The number of elements in the nth row is n.

## Step 3: Calculate the row number
Since 2026 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 675 with a remainder of 1, 2026 is in the 676th position, but we need to consider it as part of the 676th row because the first element of the row is the 1st position in the sequence. Therefore, 2026 is in the 676th row.

## Step 4: Calculate the column number
However, considering the spiral pattern, the first element of each row starts at the 1st column. Since the sequence increases by 1 in each column as well, the position of 2026 in the sequence is actually in the 3rd column of the 676th row.

## Step 5: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026. Since 2026 is in the 676th row and 3rd column, we can identify its neighbors as those in the same row or adjacent rows.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
We need to find the numbers in the 3rd column of the 675th and 677th rows, as well as the numbers in the 676th row but one column to the left and right of 2026. Since the numbers increase by 1 in each direction, we can calculate the sum of these numbers.

## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the 675th row
In the 675th row, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The sum of these numbers is 45.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the 677th row
In the 677th row, the numbers are 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683. The sum of these numbers is 3426.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the 676th row but one column to the left and right of 2026
The numbers in the 676th row but one column to the left and right of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033. The sum of these numbers is 10368.

## Step 10: Calculate the total sum of the neighbors
The total sum of the neighbors is the sum of the numbers in the 675th row, the 677th row, and the numbers in the 676th row but one column to the left and right of 2026.

## Step 11: Add the sums of the numbers in the 675th, 677th rows, and the numbers in the 676th row but one column to the left and right of 2026
The sum of the neighbors is 45 + 3426 + 10368 = 11839.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11839}$
