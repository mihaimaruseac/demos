## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid. The first row goes from 3 to 9, the second row from 6 to 1, the third row from 7 to 8 to 9, and the fourth row from 5 to 4 to 3.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, we need to find the row and column where 2026 is located.

## Step 3: Identify the row and column of 2026
By examining the pattern, we can see that the numbers increase by 1 as we move from left to right and top to bottom. We can count the numbers to find the row and column of 2026.

## Step 4: Count the numbers to find the row and column of 2026
The first row has numbers from 3 to 9, the second row has numbers from 6 to 1, the third row has numbers from 7 to 8 to 9, and the fourth row has numbers from 5 to 4 to 3. We can continue counting until we reach 2026.

## Step 5: Identify the row and column of 2026
After counting, we find that 2026 is located in the 5th row and 2nd column.

## Step 6: Find the 8 neighbors of 2026
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally above-left, above-right, below-left, and below-right of 2026.

## Step 7: Identify the neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is in the 5th row and 2nd column, its neighbors are the numbers in the 4th row and 1st column, 4th row and 3rd column, 6th row and 2nd column, 6th row and 3rd column, 4th row and 1st column, and the numbers in the 6th row and 1st column, 6th row and 3rd column.

## Step 8: Find the values of the neighbors
We can find the values of the neighbors by looking at the pattern of the numbers.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Once we have the values of the neighbors, we can calculate their sum.

## Step 10: Find the sum of the neighbors of 2026
After calculating, we find that the sum of the neighbors of 2026 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$
