## Step 1: Understand the layout and the position of the number 2026
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid. We need to determine the position of the number 2026 in this grid.

## Step 2: Determine the pattern of the spiral
Looking at the arrangement, we notice that the numbers are arranged in a clockwise spiral starting from the top left. The pattern is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on.

## Step 3: Find the position of 2026 in the spiral
We can calculate the position of 2026 in the spiral by considering its value and the pattern of the spiral. Since the numbers increase by 1 as we move right and down, we can find the row and column of 2026.

## Step 4: Calculate the row and column of 2026
To find the row and column of 2026, we can use the fact that the numbers increase by 1 as we move right and down. We can calculate the row and column of 2026 by finding the remainder when 2026 is divided by 9. The remainder will tell us which number in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 2026 is.

## Step 5: Calculate the row and column of 2026
2026 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 8. This means that 2026 is the 8th number in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

## Step 6: Determine the row and column of 2026
Since 2026 is the 8th number in the sequence, it is in the 3rd row and 3rd column.

## Step 7: Identify the 8 neighbors of 2026
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026, as well as the numbers diagonally adjacent to 2026.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is in the 3rd row and 3rd column, its neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2019, 2028, 2017, 2029, 2016, and 2027.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026
To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026, we need to add these numbers together.

## Step 10: Calculate the sum
2025 + 2027 + 2019 + 2028 + 2017 + 2029 + 2016 + 2027 = 16191

The final answer is: $\boxed{16191}$
