## Step 1: Understand the layout and find the position of 2026
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, starting from the top left and moving clockwise. To find the position of 2026, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral. Since the numbers increase as we move down and to the right, we can deduce that the numbers increase in a clockwise spiral. We can also observe that each number is surrounded by four other numbers.

## Step 2: Identify the position of 2026
Since the numbers increase in a clockwise spiral, we can count the numbers to find the position of 2026. Starting from the top left, we count 2026. We can see that the numbers are arranged in a square grid with 8x8 numbers. We can also see that 2026 is at the bottom right corner.

## Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is at the bottom right corner, its 8 neighbors are at the top right, bottom left, top left, bottom right, top center, bottom center, left center, and right center.

## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Since the numbers increase in a clockwise spiral, we can calculate the sum of the neighbors by adding the numbers at the top right, bottom left, top left, bottom right, top center, bottom center, left center, and right center.

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is 2026 + 2027 + 2025 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + 2027 + 2026 = 16180.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
However, we can also notice that the numbers are in a square grid, and 2026 is at the bottom right corner. Therefore, the sum of the neighbors can also be calculated by adding the numbers at the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column.

## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is (2026 + 2025 + 2024 + 2023) + (2028 + 2029 + 2027 + 2026) + (2027 + 2026 + 2025 + 2024) + (2029 + 2028 + 2027 + 2026) = 8092 + 8092 + 8092 + 8092 = 32268.

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
However, we can also notice that the sum of the neighbors is equal to 4 times the sum of the numbers in the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column.

## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the numbers in the top row is 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 8160.

## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the numbers in the bottom row is 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 = 8098.

## Step 11: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the numbers in the left column is 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 8160.

## Step 12: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the numbers in the right column is 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 = 8098.

## Step 13: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors is 4 times the sum of the numbers in the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column, which is 4 * (8160 + 8098 + 8160 + 8098) = 4 * 32416 = 129664.

## Step 14: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
However, we can also notice that the sum of the neighbors is equal to 4 times the sum of the numbers in the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column, minus 4 times the number 2026.

## Step 15: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of the neighbors is 4 * (8160 + 8098 + 8160 + 8098) - 4 * 2026 = 129664 - 8134 = 119230.

The final answer is: $\boxed{119230}$
