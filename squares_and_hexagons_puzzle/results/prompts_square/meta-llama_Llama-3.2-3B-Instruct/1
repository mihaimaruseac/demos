## Step 1: Understand the layout and how numbers are distributed on the grid.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid, starting from the top left and moving right, then down, then left, and finally up, repeating the pattern. We need to identify the position of the number 2026 on this grid.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 on the grid.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, we need to find where 2026 would be placed in this sequence. The sequence starts from 1 and goes up to 2026. The pattern repeats every 9 numbers (as 1 to 9 are in one cycle of the spiral). To find the position of 2026, we can divide 2026 by 9 and look at the remainder.

## Step 3: Calculate the position of 2026 in the spiral sequence.
Divide 2026 by 9 to get 225 with a remainder of 1. This means 2026 is the first number in the sequence, placing it at the top left of the grid.

## Step 4: Identify the neighbors of 2026.
Since 2026 is at the top left of the grid, its neighbors are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it. However, because the spiral pattern wraps around, we also need to consider the numbers that would be diagonally adjacent.

## Step 5: Calculate the values of the neighbors.
Given the position of 2026, its neighbors are 2027 (to the right), 2025 (to the left), 2028 (below), and 2024 (above). Additionally, considering the wrap-around, the diagonally adjacent numbers would be 2025 (top left) and 2029 (bottom right), but these are not directly adjacent in the traditional sense as they are not part of the immediate 8-neighbor count.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the neighbors.
To find the sum, add up the values of the neighbors: 2027 + 2025 + 2028 + 2024 + 2025 + 2029 + 2027 + 2029.

## Step 7: Perform the addition.
2027 + 2025 = 4052, 4052 + 2028 = 6070, 6070 + 2024 = 8094, 8094 + 2025 = 10119, 10119 + 2029 = 12148, 12148 + 2029 = 14177.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14177}$
