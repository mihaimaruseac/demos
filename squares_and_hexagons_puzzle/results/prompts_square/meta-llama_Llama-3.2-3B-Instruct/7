## Step 1: Understand the layout of the numbers
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern on a square grid, with each number being surrounded by four other numbers.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, we need to determine where the number 2026 is located. However, given the arrangement, we can deduce that 2026 will be at the center of the spiral, surrounded by four numbers.

## Step 3: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026
The number 2026 will have four neighbors: one to the left, one to the right, one above, and one below.

## Step 4: Determine the values of the neighbors
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, we can see that the numbers are increasing by 1 in a clockwise direction. Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 will be 2025, 2027, 2028, and 2027.

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
To find the sum of the neighbors, we simply add the values of the four neighbors together.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum
The sum of the neighbors is 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2027.

## Step 7: Calculate the final answer
Perform the addition to get the final answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8097}$
