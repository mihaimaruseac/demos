The problem asks for the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a spiral grid.
First, we need to determine the coordinates of the number 2026. Let (0,0) be the position of the number 1. The spiral grows outwards.

Let's denote "Layer k" as the square with maximum absolute coordinate k.
The largest number in Layer k is N_k_BR = (2k+1)^2, located at (k, -k). This is the "Bottom Right" corner.
Let's verify:
k=0: 1 at (0,0) (Special case, N_0_BR=1)
k=1: (2*1+1)^2 = 9 at (1,-1)
k=2: (2*2+1)^2 = 25 at (2,-2)

The numbers in Layer k range from (2k-1)^2 + 1 to (2k+1)^2.
Let's find the layer for 2026:
We estimate sqrt(2026) approx 45.
If (2k+1) = 45, then 2k=44, so k=22.
For k=22:
(2*22-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849.
(2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
So, the number 2025 is at (22, -22), which is the BR corner of Layer 22.

The number 2026 is (2k-1)^2 + 1 for k=23.
So 2026 is the first number in Layer 23.
The numbers in Layer k start from (2k-1)^2 + 1.
The path for Layer k starts at (k, -(k-1)) and moves in the following sequence:
1. Right (from (k-1, -(k-1)) to (k, -(k-1))), then Up (from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k)).
   The value at (k, y) for -(k-1) <= y <= k is (2k-1)^2 + k + y.
2. Left (from (k, k) to (-k, k)).
   The value at (x, k) for -k <= x < k is (2k-1)^2 + 3k - x.
3. Down (from (-k, k) to (-k, -k)).
   The value at (-k, y) for -k <= y < k is (2k-1)^2 + 5k - y.
4. Right (from (-k, -k) to (k, -k)).
   The value at (x, -k) for -k <= x < k is (2k-1)^2 + 7k + x.
The final number in the layer, (2k+1)^2, is at (k, -k), which is obtained from the last formula by setting x=k: (2k-1)^2 + 7k + k = (2k-1)^2 + 8k = (4k^2-4k+1) + 8k = 4k^2+4k+1 = (2k+1)^2.

Let's find the coordinates of 2026:
2026 is the first number in Layer 23. So k=23.
According to our path description, the first number in Layer k, which is (2k-1)^2+1, is at (k, -(k-1)).
For k=23, the coordinates are (23, -(23-1)) = (23, -22).
Let's check using the formula for the "Up" segment (segment 1):
Value at (23, -22) = (2*23-1)^2 + 23 + (-22) = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026.
This confirms that 2026 is at (x_N, y_N) = (23, -22).

Now we need to find the values of its 8 neighbors:
(x_N-1, y_N) = (22, -22)
(x_N+1, y_N) = (24, -22)
(x_N, y_N-1) = (23, -23)
(x_N, y_N+1) = (23, -21)
(x_N-1, y_N-1) = (22, -23)
(x_N-1, y_N+1) = (22, -21)
(x_N+1, y_N-1) = (24, -23)
(x_N+1, y_N+1) = (24, -21)

We determine the layer k' for each neighbor by finding max(|x'|,|y'|). Then we apply the corresponding segment formula.

1.  **N(22, -22)**: k'=22. This is (k', -k'), the BR corner of Layer 22.
    Value = (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
2.  **N(24, -22)**: k'=24. This is (k', -(k'-1)), the starting point of Layer 24. It's on segment 1.
    Value = (2*24-1)^2 + 24 + (-22) = 47^2 + 2 = 2209 + 2 = 2211.
3.  **N(23, -23)**: k'=23. This is (k', -k'), the BR corner of Layer 23.
    Value = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.
4.  **N(23, -21)**: k'=23. This is (k', y) on segment 1 of Layer 23 (x=k').
    Value = (2*23-1)^2 + 23 + (-21) = 45^2 + 2 = 2025 + 2 = 2027.
5.  **N(22, -23)**: k'=23. This is (x, -k') on segment 4 of Layer 23 (y=-k').
    Value = (2*23-1)^2 + 7*23 + 22 = 45^2 + 161 + 22 = 2025 + 183 = 2208.
6.  **N(22, -21)**: k'=22. This is (k', y) on segment 1 of Layer 22 (x=k').
    Value = (2*22-1)^2 + 22 + (-21) = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850.
7.  **N(24, -23)**: k'=24. This is (k', -(k'-1)), the starting point of Layer 24. It's on segment 1.
    Value = (2*24-1)^2 + 24 + (-23) = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
8.  **N(24, -21)**: k'=24. This is (k', y) on segment 1 of Layer 24 (x=k').
    Value = (2*24-1)^2 + 24 + (-21) = 47^2 + 3 = 2209 + 3 = 2212.

Now, we sum these 8 neighbor values:
Sum = 2025 + 2211 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 1850 + 2210 + 2212 = 16952.

The final answer is $\boxed{16952}$.
