The problem asks for the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral laid out on a square grid.

First, let's understand the spiral pattern and locate numbers.
Let (x,y) be the coordinates, with (0,0) being the center.
1 is at (0,0).
The spiral moves clockwise, as per the given example:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

Let's trace the first few numbers:
N(0,0) = 1
N(1,0) = 2 (moves right)
N(1,1) = 3 (moves up)
N(0,1) = 4 (moves left)
N(-1,1) = 5 (moves left)
N(-1,0) = 6 (moves down)
N(-1,-1) = 7 (moves down)
N(0,-1) = 8 (moves right)
N(1,-1) = 9 (moves right)

Observations:
1.  The numbers (2k+1)^2 are located at (k, -k).
    For k=0, 1^2 = 1 at (0,0).
    For k=1, 3^2 = 9 at (1,-1).
    For k=2, 5^2 = 25 at (2,-2).

2.  After reaching (k, -k) with value (2k+1)^2, the spiral continues by moving right.
    N(k+1, -k) = (2k+1)^2 + 1.

Let's find the coordinates of the number 2026.
We need to find k such that (2k+1)^2 is close to 2026.
44^2 = 1936
45^2 = 2025
46^2 = 2116
So, 2025 = (2*22+1)^2. This means k=22.
The number 2025 is at (k, -k) = (22, -22).

Following the spiral rule, the number after 2025 moves to the right.
So, N(23, -22) = 2025 + 1 = 2026.
The number 2026 is at (x_0, y_0) = (23, -22).

Now we need to find the values of its 8 neighbors:
(x_0-1, y_0-1) = (22, -23)
(x_0, y_0-1)   = (23, -23)
(x_0+1, y_0-1) = (24, -23)
(x_0-1, y_0)   = (22, -22)
(x_0+1, y_0)   = (24, -22)
(x_0-1, y_0+1) = (22, -21)
(x_0, y_0+1)   = (23, -21)
(x_0+1, y_0+1) = (24, -21)

Let's calculate each neighbor's value using the spiral pattern:

1.  N(22, -22): This is (k, -k) for k=22. So N(22, -22) = (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.

2.  N(23, -21): From N(23, -22) = 2026, the spiral moves upwards along the right edge.
    So, N(23, -21) = 2026 + 1 = 2027.

3.  N(23, -23): This is (k+1, -(k+1)) for k=22. So N(23, -23) = (2*(22+1)+1)^2 = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.
    This value marks the end of the 23-layer spiral's bottom-right corner.

Now, let's find the others, identifying the "layer" K for each coordinate (x,y) as K = max(|x|,|y|).

4.  N(24, -23): K=24. This number starts the next outward shell (layer K=24).
    The previous shell ended at (23, -23) with value 2209.
    From (23, -23), the spiral moves right to (24, -23).
    So, N(24, -23) = 2209 + 1 = 2210.

5.  N(24, -22): K=24. From (24, -23) = 2210, the spiral moves up.
    So, N(24, -22) = 2210 + 1 = 2211.

6.  N(24, -21): K=24. From (24, -22) = 2211, the spiral moves up.
    So, N(24, -21) = 2211 + 1 = 2212.

7.  N(22, -21): K=22. This is on the (k-1)-th shell.
    (2*21+1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 is at (21, -21).
    From (21, -21), the spiral moves right to (22, -21).
    So, N(22, -21) = 1849 + 1 = 1850.

8.  N(22, -23): K=23. This is on the bottom side (y=-23) of the K=23 shell.
    The values on the bottom side of a shell start at (-K, -K) and increase as x increases to K.
    The value at (-23, -23) is (2K+1)^2 - 6K = (2*23+1)^2 - 6*23 = 47^2 - 138 = 2209 - 138 = 2071.
    N(x, -23) = N(-23, -23) + (x - (-23)) = 2071 + (x+23).
    So, N(22, -23) = 2071 + (22+23) = 2071 + 45 = 2116.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
*   N(22, -23) = 2116
*   N(23, -23) = 2209
*   N(24, -23) = 2210
*   N(22, -22) = 2025
*   N(24, -22) = 2211
*   N(22, -21) = 1850
*   N(23, -21) = 2027
*   N(24, -21) = 2212

Sum of these 8 numbers:
2116 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 16860.

The final answer is $\boxed{16860}$.
