To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 on the spiral grid. Let's denote the coordinates as (x, y) with (0,0) being the center where the number 1 is located.

The spiral pattern is as follows:
1 is at (0,0).
The numbers form square layers.
The maximum number in a layer m is (2m+1)^2. This number is always at coordinates (m, -m).
For m=0, N_max = 1^2 = 1, at (0,0).
For m=1, N_max = 3^2 = 9, at (1,-1).
For m=2, N_max = 5^2 = 25, at (2,-2).

Let's find the layer for 2026.
We look for m such that (2(m-1)+1)^2 < 2026 <= (2m+1)^2.
Let's approximate sqrt(2026). sqrt(2025) = 45.
So, 2m+1 is approximately 45.
If 2m+1 = 45, then 2m = 44, so m = 22.
Let's check N_22_max: (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
This means 2025 is the last number in layer 22, and it is located at (22, -22).

The number 2026 is N_22_max + 1, so it is the first number in the next layer, layer 23.
The spiral continues from (m, -m) by moving right to (m+1, -m).
So, from (22, -22) for 2025, the number 2026 is at (22+1, -22) = (23, -22).
Let (x_0, y_0) = (23, -22) be the coordinates of 2026.
The layer for 2026 is m=23.

Now we need to find the numbers at the 8 neighboring coordinates:
(x_0-1, y_0-1), (x_0-1, y_0), (x_0-1, y_0+1)
(x_0, y_0-1),                    (x_0, y_0+1)
(x_0+1, y_0-1), (x_0+1, y_0), (x_0+1, y_0+1)

Let's define a general method to find N(x,y) for a given (x,y).
First, find the layer m for the point (x,y). This is m = max(|x|,|y|).
Let N_m_prev_max = (2(m-1)+1)^2.
The numbers in layer m start from N_m_prev_max + 1.
1. The segment from (m, -(m-1)) to (m, m) (moving upwards):
   N(m, y) = N_m_prev_max + m + y, for -(m-1) <= y <= m.
2. The segment from (m-1, m) to (-m, m) (moving leftwards):
   N(x, m) = N_m_prev_max + 2m + (m-x), for -m <= x <= m-1. (Here N_m_prev_max+2m is N(m,m))
3. The segment from (-m, m-1) to (-m, -m) (moving downwards):
   N(-m, y) = N_m_prev_max + 4m + (m-y), for -m <= y <= m-1. (Here N_m_prev_max+4m is N(-m,m))
4. The segment from (-m+1, -m) to (m, -m) (moving rightwards):
   N(x, -m) = N_m_prev_max + 6m + (m+x), for -m <= x <= m. (Here N_m_prev_max+6m is N(-m,-m))
   The number at (m,-m) is N_m_prev_max + 8m = (2m-1)^2 + 8m = (2m+1)^2.

Let's calculate N for each neighbor of (23, -22):

1.  **N(22, -23)**:
    Here m = max(|22|, |-23|) = 23.
    This point is on the segment (x, -m) for x from -m to m.
    Using formula 4: N(x, -m) = N_22_max + 6*23 + (23+x)
    N(22, -23) = 2025 + 138 + (23+22) = 2025 + 138 + 45 = 2208.
    Alternatively, (23,-23) is N_23_max = 47^2 = 2209. (22,-23) is N_23_max - 1 = 2208.

2.  **N(22, -22)**:
    This point is (m-1, -(m-1)) for m=23. This is (22,-22). This is N_22_max.
    N(22, -22) = 2025.

3.  **N(22, -21)**:
    Here m = max(|22|, |-21|) = 22.
    This point is on the segment (m, y) for y from -(m-1) to m (first side, going up).
    Using formula 1: N(m, y) = N_21_max + m + y.
    N_21_max = (2*21+1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849.
    N(22, -21) = 1849 + 22 + (-21) = 1849 + 1 = 1850.

4.  **N(23, -23)**:
    This point is (m, -m) for m=23. This is N_23_max.
    N_23_max = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.

5.  **N(23, -21)**:
    Here m = max(|23|, |-21|) = 23.
    This point is on the segment (m, y) for y from -(m-1) to m.
    Using formula 1: N(m, y) = N_22_max + m + y.
    N(23, -21) = 2025 + 23 + (-21) = 2025 + 2 = 2027.

6.  **N(24, -23)**:
    Here m = max(|24|, |-23|) = 24.
    This point is on the segment (m, y) for y from -(m-1) to m.
    Using formula 1: N(m, y) = N_23_max + m + y.
    N_23_max = 2209.
    N(24, -23) = 2209 + 24 + (-23) = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
    Alternatively, this is N_23_max + 1, as it's the start of layer 24.

7.  **N(24, -22)**:
    Here m = max(|24|, |-22|) = 24.
    This point is on the segment (m, y) for y from -(m-1) to m.
    Using formula 1: N(m, y) = N_23_max + m + y.
    N(24, -22) = 2209 + 24 + (-22) = 2209 + 2 = 2211.

8.  **N(24, -21)**:
    Here m = max(|24|, |-21|) = 24.
    This point is on the segment (m, y) for y from -(m-1) to m.
    Using formula 1: N(m, y) = N_23_max + m + y.
    N(24, -21) = 2209 + 24 + (-21) = 2209 + 3 = 2212.

The 8 neighbor values are:
N(22, -23) = 2208
N(22, -22) = 2025
N(22, -21) = 1850
N(23, -23) = 2209
N(23, -21) = 2027
N(24, -23) = 2210
N(24, -22) = 2211
N(24, -21) = 2212

Sum of these values:
2208 + 2025 + 1850 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952.

The final answer is $\boxed{16952}$.
