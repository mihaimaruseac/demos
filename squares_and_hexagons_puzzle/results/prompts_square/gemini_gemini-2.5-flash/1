To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral grid. Let (0,0) be the position of the number 1.

The spiral pattern has squares of numbers. Let's analyze the numbers at the corners:
- The number 1 is at (0,0).
- For a square of size (2k+1) x (2k+1), the largest number is (2k+1)^2. This number is located at (k, -k), which is the bottom-right corner of the square.
    - For k=1, (2*1+1)^2 = 9 is at (1,-1).
    - For k=2, (2*2+1)^2 = 25 is at (2,-2).
    - For k=3, (2*3+1)^2 = 49 is at (3,-3).

We need to find k such that (2k+1)^2 is close to 2026.
sqrt(2026) is approximately 45.01. So, 2k+1 is approximately 45.
Let's test 2k+1 = 45, which means k = 22.
For k=22, (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
So, the number 2025 is located at (22, -22). This is the bottom-right corner of the (2*22+1) x (2*22+1) square (a 45x45 square).

Now, let's determine the position of 2026.
The number (2k+1)^2 is at (k, -k).
The next number, (2k+1)^2 + 1, starts a new layer of the spiral. This number is typically at (k+1, -k).
Let's verify this pattern:
- 9 is at (1,-1). 9+1=10 is at (1+1, -1) = (2,-1). (This is correct in the spiral).
- 25 is at (2,-2). 25+1=26 is at (2+1, -2) = (3,-2). (This is also correct).

Applying this pattern for k=22:
2025 is at (22, -22).
So, 2026 (which is 2025+1) is at (22+1, -22) = (23, -22).
Let (X,Y) = (23, -22) be the coordinates of 2026.

Now we need to find the values of the 8 neighbors of 2026. Let's list their coordinates:
1. (X-1, Y) = (22, -22)
2. (X+1, Y) = (24, -22)
3. (X, Y-1) = (23, -23)
4. (X, Y+1) = (23, -21)
5. (X-1, Y-1) = (22, -23)
6. (X-1, Y+1) = (22, -21)
7. (X+1, Y-1) = (24, -23)
8. (X+1, Y+1) = (24, -21)

To find the value N(x,y) at any coordinate (x,y), we use the following general rules based on the layer k = max(|x|,|y|):
- The bottom-right corner (k, -k) has the value (2k+1)^2.
- The start of a layer, S_k = (k, -(k-1)), has the value (2k-1)^2 + 1. From this point, the spiral moves upwards along the right edge (x=k).
- The top-right corner (k, k) has the value (2k-1)^2 + 2k.
- The top-left corner (-k, k) has the value (2k-1)^2 + 4k.
- The bottom-left corner (-k, -k) has the value (2k-1)^2 + 6k.
- Values on the right edge (x=k, from -(k-1) to k) are N(k, y) = S_k + (y - (-(k-1))).
- Values on the top edge (y=k, from k to -k) are N(x, k) = N(-k,k) - (x - (-k)). (Decreasing x value)
- Values on the left edge (x=-k, from k to -k) are N(-k, y) = N(-k,-k) - (y - (-k)). (Decreasing y value)
- Values on the bottom edge (y=-k, from -k to k) are N(x, -k) = N(-k,-k) + (x - (-k)). (Increasing x value)

Let's calculate the value for each neighbor, using N=2026 at (23, -22). Here, k=23.

1.  **N(22, -22)**:
    This is (k-1, -(k-1)) for k=23. So it's the bottom-right corner of the (2*22+1)x(2*22+1) square.
    Value is (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = **2025**.

2.  **N(24, -22)**:
    For this point, k' = max(|24|,|-22|) = 24. It's in the layer k'=24.
    The start of layer 24 is S_24 = (24, -(24-1)) = (24, -23).
    Its value is (2*24-1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
    From S_24, the spiral moves upwards. So N(24, -22) = N(24, -23) + 1.
    Value is 2210 + 1 = **2211**.

3.  **N(23, -23)**:
    This is (k, -k) for k=23. So it's the bottom-right corner of layer 23.
    Value is (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = **2209**.

4.  **N(23, -21)**:
    This is (k, -(k-1)+1) for k=23. (23, -22) is 2026. The spiral moves up from here.
    Value is 2026 + 1 = **2027**.

5.  **N(22, -23)**:
    For this point, k'=max(|22|,|-23|) = 23. It's on the bottom edge (y=-23) of layer 23.
    The bottom-left corner of layer 23 is BL_23 = (-23, -23). Its value is (2*23-1)^2 + 6*23 = 45^2 + 138 = 2025 + 138 = 2163.
    Values on the bottom edge increase as x increases. So N(x, -23) = BL_23 + (x - (-23)).
    Value is 2163 + (22 - (-23)) = 2163 + 45 = **2208**.

6.  **N(22, -21)**:
    For this point, k'=max(|22|,|-21|) = 22. It's in layer 22.
    This is S_22 = (22, -(22-1)) = (22, -21).
    Its value is (2*22-1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = **1850**.

7.  **N(24, -23)**:
    This is S_24 = (24, -(24-1)) = (24, -23).
    Its value is (2*24-1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = **2210**.

8.  **N(24, -21)**:
    For this point, k'=max(|24|,|-21|) = 24. It's on the right edge (x=24) of layer 24.
    S_24 = (24, -23) has value 2210. From there, the spiral moves upwards.
    N(24, -21) = N(24, -23) + (-21 - (-23)) = 2210 + 2 = **2212**.

The 8 neighbors and their values are:
- N(22, -22) = 2025
- N(24, -22) = 2211
- N(23, -23) = 2209
- N(23, -21) = 2027
- N(22, -23) = 2208
- N(22, -21) = 1850
- N(24, -23) = 2210
- N(24, -21) = 2212

Summing these values:
2025 + 2211 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 1850 + 2210 + 2212 = **16952**.

The final answer is $\boxed{16952}$.
