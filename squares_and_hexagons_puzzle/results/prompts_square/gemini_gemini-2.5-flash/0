The problem asks for the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral laid out on a square grid. Let's first understand the spiral pattern and locate the number 2026. We will use a coordinate system where (0,0) is the center, corresponding to the number 1.

The spiral pattern is:
1 at (0,0)
2 at (1,0)
3 at (1,1)
4 at (0,1)
5 at (-1,1)
6 at (-1,0)
7 at (-1,-1)
8 at (0,-1)
9 at (1,-1)

We observe that perfect squares of odd numbers (2k+1)^2 are located at coordinates (k, -k):
1 = (2*0+1)^2 at (0,0)
9 = (2*1+1)^2 at (1,-1)
25 = (2*2+1)^2 at (2,-2)

Let's find k such that (2k+1)^2 is close to 2026.
sqrt(2026) is approximately 45.01.
Let 2k+1 = 45. Then k = 22.
So, (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
The number 2025 is located at (k, -k) = (22, -22).

Now let's locate 2026.
From the pattern, after (2k+1)^2 at (k, -k), the spiral continues to the right.
For example, after 9 at (1,-1), the number 10 is at (2,-1).
So, after 2025 at (22,-22), the number 2026 is at (22+1, -22) = (23, -22).
So, N = 2026 is at (x_N, y_N) = (23, -22).

Now we need to find the values of its 8 neighbors. The neighbors of (x_N, y_N) are:
(x_N-1, y_N-1), (x_N, y_N-1), (x_N+1, y_N-1)
(x_N-1, y_N),   (x_N, y_N),   (x_N+1, y_N)
(x_N-1, y_N+1), (x_N, y_N+1), (x_N+1, y_N+1)

Substituting (23, -22) for (x_N, y_N):
A = (22, -23)
B = (23, -23)
C = (24, -23)

D = (22, -22)
N = (23, -22) = 2026
E = (24, -22)

F = (22, -21)
G = (23, -21)
H = (24, -21)

Let's determine the values for each neighbor:

1.  **N = (23, -22) = 2026.** (Given)

2.  **D = (22, -22)**: This is (k, -k) for k=22. So D = (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.

3.  **Direction of the spiral at N**: After (k, -k) which is 2025 at (22,-22), the spiral goes to (k+1, -k) which is 2026 at (23,-22). From the general pattern (e.g., 9 at (1,-1) -> 10 at (2,-1) -> 11 at (2,0) -> 12 at (2,1) -> 13 at (2,2)), the spiral then turns UP. So, at 2026, the spiral is moving UP.

4.  **G = (23, -21)**: Since the spiral is moving UP from N (2026) at (23,-22), G is N+1. So, G = 2026+1 = 2027.

Now we use the corner square formulas for (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|) = k.
The values on the diagonals are:
-   At (k, k): (2k-1)^2 + 2k.
-   At (-k, k): (2k)^2 + 1.
-   At (-k, -k): (2k)^2 + 2k + 1.
-   At (k, -k): (2k+1)^2.

Let k_max be the maximum coordinate value for a square boundary.
For B=(23,-23), k_max = 23. This is (k_max, -k_max).
5.  **B = (23, -23)**: This is (k_max, -k_max) for k_max=23. So B = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.

From B=(23,-23)=2209: The path arriving at B is from the left. The path departing B goes right, forming the start of the next layer.
6.  **A = (22, -23)**: This is to the left of B. So A = B-1 = 2209-1 = 2208.
7.  **C = (24, -23)**: This is to the right of B. This begins a new layer with k_max=24. So C = B+1 = 2209+1 = 2210.

Now consider E and H:
The point (24,-23) = 2210 is the start of a new layer (k_max=24). From the pattern, the spiral moves UP from here (e.g., from (2,-1) (10) it goes up to (2,0) (11)).
8.  **E = (24, -22)**: This is UP from C (2210). So E = C+1 = 2210+1 = 2211.
9.  **H = (24, -21)**: This is UP from E (2211). So H = E+1 = 2211+1 = 2212.

Finally, F=(22,-21). This point is above D=(22,-22) and to the left of G=(23,-21).
Let's use the segment rule for (k,y) coordinates.
The numbers along the rightmost column (x=k) from (k,-k) upwards decrease by 1 for each step up.
The value at (k,-k) is (2k+1)^2.
The value at (k,-k+1) is (2k+1)^2 - 1.
For D=(22,-22), k=22, so D is (k,-k) and its value is 2025.
10. **F = (22, -21)**: This is (k, -k+1) for k=22. So F = D-1 = 2025-1 = 2024.

All 8 neighbors' values are:
A = 2208
B = 2209
C = 2210
D = 2025
E = 2211
F = 2024
G = 2027
H = 2212

Sum of neighbors = A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H
Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 2024 + 2027 + 2212
Sum = 17126

The final answer is $\boxed{17126}$.
