The problem asks for the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a counter-clockwise spiral grid.

First, let's establish a coordinate system for the spiral. Let the number 1 be at coordinates (0,0). The given example shows the spiral starting by moving right:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

Let (r,c) denote the row and column coordinates.
1 is at (0,0).
2 is at (0,1). (Right from 1)
3 is at (-1,1). (Up from 2)
4 is at (-1,0). (Left from 3)
5 is at (-1,-1). (Left from 4)
6 is at (0,-1). (Down from 5)
7 is at (1,-1). (Down from 6)
8 is at (1,0). (Right from 7)
9 is at (1,1). (Right from 8)

We observe a pattern:
The number (2k+1)^2 is at the top-right corner (k,k) of the k-th shell.
For k=0, (2*0+1)^2 = 1 is at (0,0).
For k=1, (2*1+1)^2 = 9 is at (1,1).
For k=2, (2*2+1)^2 = 25 is at (2,2).

Let's determine the coordinates of 2026.
We need to find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2k+1)^2.
Calculate squares:
40^2 = 1600
45^2 = 2025
46^2 = 2116
So, 2025 = (2*22+1)^2. This means (2k+1) = 45, so k=22.
Thus, the number 2025 is at (22,22).

The spiral moves counter-clockwise. From (k,k), the path continues to the right.
So, the number after 2025 (at (22,22)) is 2026, and its coordinates are (22,23).
Thus, the target number 2026 is at (r_0, c_0) = (22,23).

Next, we need to find the values of its 8 neighbors. The coordinates of the neighbors are:
(r_0-1, c_0-1) = (21,22)
(r_0-1, c_0)   = (21,23)
(r_0-1, c_0+1) = (21,24)
(r_0,   c_0-1) = (22,22)
(r_0,   c_0+1) = (22,24)
(r_0+1, c_0-1) = (23,22)
(r_0+1, c_0)   = (23,23)
(r_0+1, c_0+1) = (23,24)

To find the value N(r,c) at any coordinate (r,c), we determine the shell k = max(|r|,|c|).
Let N_k = (2k+1)^2, which is the value at (k,k).
The numbers fill the grid in a counter-clockwise manner, starting from (k,k) and decreasing.
The values on the four sides of the square with maximum coordinate k are:
1.  Rightmost column (x=k, from (k,k) down to (k,-k)):
    N(k,y) = N_k - (k-y) for y from k down to -k.
    (e.g., k=1: N(1,1)=9, N(1,0)=8, N(1,-1)=7)
2.  Bottommost row (y=-k, from (k,-k) left to (-k,-k)):
    N(x,-k) = N(k,-k) - (k-x) = (N_k - 2k) - (k-x) for x from k down to -k.
    (e.g., k=1: N(1,-1)=7, N(0,-1)=6, N(-1,-1)=5)
3.  Leftmost column (x=-k, from (-k,-k) up to (-k,k)):
    N(-k,y) = N(-k,-k) - (k+y) = (N_k - 4k) - (k+y) for y from -k up to k.
    (e.g., k=1: N(-1,-1)=5, N(-1,0)=4, N(-1,1)=3)
4.  Topmost row (y=k, from (-k,k) right to (k,k)):
    N(x,k) = N(-k,k) - (k+x) = (N_k - 6k) - (k+x) for x from -k up to k.
    (e.g., k=1: N(-1,1)=3, N(0,1)=2)

Let's calculate the values for the 8 neighbors:

1.  (21,22): k=max(|21|,|22|)=22. r=21, c=22. This is on the topmost row (y=k, x=21).
    N(21,22) = (2*22+1)^2 - 6*22 - (22+21) = 45^2 - 132 - 43 = 2025 - 132 - 43 = 1850.

2.  (21,23): k=max(|21|,|23|)=23. r=21, c=23. This is on the topmost row (y=k, x=21).
    N(21,23) = (2*23+1)^2 - 6*23 - (23+21) = 47^2 - 138 - 44 = 2209 - 138 - 44 = 2027.

3.  (21,24): k=max(|21|,|24|)=24. r=21, c=24. This is on the topmost row (y=k, x=21).
    N(21,24) = (2*24+1)^2 - 6*24 - (24+21) = 49^2 - 144 - 45 = 2401 - 144 - 45 = 2212.

4.  (22,22): k=max(|22|,|22|)=22. r=22, c=22. This is a top-right corner (k,k).
    N(22,22) = (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.

5.  (22,24): k=max(|22|,|24|)=24. r=22, c=24. This is on the topmost row (y=k, x=22).
    N(22,24) = (2*24+1)^2 - 6*24 - (24+22) = 49^2 - 144 - 46 = 2401 - 144 - 46 = 2211.

6.  (23,22): k=max(|23|,|22|)=23. r=23, c=22. This is on the rightmost column (x=k, y=22).
    N(23,22) = (2*23+1)^2 - (23-22) = 47^2 - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208.

7.  (23,23): k=max(|23|,|23|)=23. r=23, c=23. This is a top-right corner (k,k).
    N(23,23) = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.

8.  (23,24): k=max(|23|,|24|)=24. r=23, c=24. This is on the topmost row (y=k, x=23).
    N(23,24) = (2*24+1)^2 - 6*24 - (24+23) = 49^2 - 144 - 47 = 2401 - 144 - 47 = 2210.

Now, sum these 8 neighbor values:
1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 = 16952.

The final answer is $\boxed{16952}$.
