To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral layout on a square grid, we need to understand the structure of the spiral and identify the neighbors of 2026.

1. **Understanding the Spiral Structure**:
   - The spiral starts at the center with the number 1.
   - It expands outward in a counterclockwise direction.
   - The numbers increase sequentially as they spiral outward.

2. **Identifying the Position of 2026**:
   - To find the position of 2026, we need to determine which layer of the spiral it is in.
   - The layers of the spiral can be visualized as concentric squares. The side length of these squares increases by 2 for each layer.
   - The first layer (innermost square) has side length 1 (contains 1 number: 1).
   - The second layer has side length 3 (contains \(3^2 - 1^2 = 8\) numbers: 2 to 9).
   - The third layer has side length 5 (contains \(5^2 - 3^2 = 16\) numbers: 10 to 25).
   - Generally, the \(n\)-th layer has side length \(2n-1\) and contains \((2n-1)^2 - (2n-3)^2 = 8n - 8\) numbers.

3. **Calculating the Layer for 2026**:
   - We need to find \(n\) such that the cumulative count of numbers up to the \(n\)-th layer includes 2026.
   - The total number of numbers up to the \(n\)-th layer is given by the sum of the first \(n\) odd squares:
     \[
     1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \cdots + (2n-1)^2 = \frac{(2n-1)^2}{4} \left( \frac{(2n-1)^2}{4} + 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total numbers} = \frac{(2n-1)^2 (2n-1)^2 + 4}{4}
     \]
   - We need to solve for \(n\) such that:
     \[
     \frac{(2n-1)^2 (2n-1)^2 + 4}{4} \geq 2026
     \]
   - By trial and error or numerical methods, we find that \(n = 23\) (since \(23^2 = 529\) and \(24^2 = 576\), 2026 falls between these values).

4. **Finding the Neighbors of 2026**:
   - The number 2026 is located in the 23rd layer.
   - The neighbors of 2026 in the spiral are the numbers immediately adjacent to it in the 8 possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonals).
   - By examining the pattern of the spiral, the neighbors of 2026 are:
     - Directly above: 2009
     - Directly below: 2043
     - Directly left: 2025
     - Directly right: 2027
     - Diagonally up-left: 2008
     - Diagonally up-right: 2010
     - Diagonally down-left: 2042
     - Diagonally down-right: 2044

5. **Calculating the Sum of the Neighbors**:
   \[
   2009 + 2043 + 2025 + 2027 + 2008 + 2010 + 2042 + 2044 = 16208
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16208} \).
