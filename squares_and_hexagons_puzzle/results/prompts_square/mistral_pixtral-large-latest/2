To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the given spiral pattern, we need to understand the structure of the spiral and identify the position of 2026 within it.

### Understanding the Spiral Pattern
The spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and expands outward. The pattern of the spiral can be visualized as follows:

1. The first layer (1x1) contains 1 number:
   ```
   1
   ```

2. The second layer (3x3) contains 8 numbers:
   ```
   2  3  4
   7  1  5
   6  8  9
   ```

3. The third layer (5x5) contains 16 numbers:
   ```
   10  11  12  13  14
   15  4   1   2   16
   24  7   6   3   17
   23  8   5   9   18
   22  21  20  19  18
   ```

And so on. Each layer adds a new ring around the previous layer.

### Identifying the Position of 2026
To find the position of 2026, we need to determine which layer it falls into.

1. The first layer contains 1 number.
2. The second layer contains 8 numbers (cumulative total: 1 + 8 = 9).
3. The third layer contains 16 numbers (cumulative total: 9 + 16 = 25).
4. The fourth layer contains 24 numbers (cumulative total: 25 + 24 = 49).
5. The fifth layer contains 32 numbers (cumulative total: 49 + 32 = 81).
6. The sixth layer contains 40 numbers (cumulative total: 81 + 40 = 121).
7. The seventh layer contains 48 numbers (cumulative total: 121 + 48 = 169).
8. The eighth layer contains 56 numbers (cumulative total: 169 + 56 = 225).
9. The ninth layer contains 64 numbers (cumulative total: 225 + 64 = 289).
10. The tenth layer contains 72 numbers (cumulative total: 289 + 72 = 361).
11. The eleventh layer contains 80 numbers (cumulative total: 361 + 80 = 441).
12. The twelfth layer contains 88 numbers (cumulative total: 441 + 88 = 529).
13. The thirteenth layer contains 96 numbers (cumulative total: 529 + 96 = 625).
14. The fourteenth layer contains 104 numbers (cumulative total: 625 + 104 = 729).
15. The fifteenth layer contains 112 numbers (cumulative total: 729 + 112 = 841).
16. The sixteenth layer contains 120 numbers (cumulative total: 841 + 120 = 961).
17. The seventeenth layer contains 128 numbers (cumulative total: 961 + 128 = 1089).
18. The eighteenth layer contains 136 numbers (cumulative total: 1089 + 136 = 1225).
19. The nineteenth layer contains 144 numbers (cumulative total: 1225 + 144 = 1369).
20. The twentieth layer contains 152 numbers (cumulative total: 1369 + 152 = 1521).
21. The twenty-first layer contains 160 numbers (cumulative total: 1521 + 160 = 1681).
22. The twenty-second layer contains 168 numbers (cumulative total: 1681 + 168 = 1849).
23. The twenty-third layer contains 176 numbers (cumulative total: 1849 + 176 = 2025).

So, 2026 is the first number in the twenty-fourth layer.

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is the first number in the twenty-fourth layer, it is located at the bottom-left corner of the layer. Its neighbors are:

- Directly above: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- Directly to the right: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- Diagonally above-right: 2026 + 2 = 2028
- Diagonally above-left: 2026 - (23*2) + 1 = 2026 - 46 + 1 = 1981
- Directly below: 2026 + (23*2) - 1 = 2026 + 46 - 1 = 2071
- Directly to the left: 2026 - (23*2) = 2026 - 46 = 1980
- Diagonally below-left: 2026 - (23*2) - 1 = 2026 - 46 - 1 = 1979
- Diagonally below-right: 2026 + (23*2) = 2026 + 46 = 2072

### Sum of the Neighbors
Now, we sum these neighbors:

\[ 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 1981 + 2071 + 1980 + 1979 + 2072 = 16163 \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16163} \).
