To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral laid out on a square grid, we need to understand the pattern and position of the numbers in the spiral. Specifically, we need to determine the numbers that are adjacent to 2026.

First, let's analyze the spiral structure. The spiral starts from the center and expands outward in layers. Each layer can be visualized as a square ring around the previous layer. The side length of each layer increases by 2 as we move outward.

Let's denote the side length of the nth layer as \( L_n \). The side length of the first layer is 1 (just the center number 1). The side length of the second layer is 3, the third layer is 5, and so on. In general, the side length of the nth layer is \( 2n - 1 \).

The total number of elements in the first n layers is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is \( n^2 \). Therefore, the number 2026 will be in the layer where \( n^2 \) is just less than or equal to 2026.

Let's find the layer in which 2026 is located:

\[ 44^2 = 1936 \]
\[ 45^2 = 2025 \]

So, 2026 is in the 45th layer. The side length of the 45th layer is \( 2 \times 45 - 1 = 89 \).

Now, let's determine the position of 2026 within the 45th layer. Since \( 45^2 = 2025 \), 2026 is the first number in the 45th layer. The sequence of numbers in the 45th layer starts from the bottom-left corner and moves right, then up, then left, and finally down to complete the layer.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are the numbers immediately adjacent to it in the spiral. Since 2026 is the first number in the 45th layer, its neighbors will be:

1. The number directly above it (from the 44th layer).
2. The number directly to the right of it (from the 45th layer).
3. The number directly below it (from the 45th layer).
4. The number directly to the left of it (from the 45th layer).
5. The number diagonally above and to the right (from the 44th layer).
6. The number diagonally above and to the left (from the 44th layer).
7. The number diagonally below and to the right (from the 45th layer).
8. The number diagonally below and to the left (from the 45th layer).

Given the spiral structure, the neighbors of 2026 are:

1. 2025 (directly above, from the 44th layer)
2. 2027 (directly to the right, from the 45th layer)
3. 2043 (directly below, from the 45th layer)
4. 2024 (directly to the left, from the 44th layer)
5. 2010 (diagonally above and to the right, from the 44th layer)
6. 1998 (diagonally above and to the left, from the 44th layer)
7. 2044 (diagonally below and to the right, from the 45th layer)
8. 2028 (diagonally below and to the left, from the 45th layer)

Now, we sum these neighbors:

\[ 2025 + 2027 + 2043 + 2024 + 2010 + 1998 + 2044 + 2028 = 16199 \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16199} \).
