To find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the given spiral pattern, we first need to understand the structure of the spiral and the position of 2026 within it.

The spiral starts from 1 and expands outward in a counterclockwise direction. The structure of the spiral can be visualized as follows:

```
... 5  4  3
... 6  1  2
... 7  8  9
```

Each layer of the spiral adds a new square layer of numbers around the previous layer. The number 2026 will be located in one of these layers.

To determine the layer in which 2026 resides, we need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 2026. The largest perfect square less than 2026 is \(44^2 = 1936\). This means 2026 is in the layer that starts just after 1936.

The numbers in this layer follow a specific pattern. The layer starts at 1937 and continues as follows:
- 1937 to 1980 (right side of the square)
- 1981 to 2024 (top side of the square)
- 2025 (corner)
- 2026 to 2069 (left side of the square)

Since 2026 is on the left side of the square, its neighbors will be:
- Directly above: 2025
- Directly below: 2027
- To the left: 2024
- To the right: 2081
- Diagonally top-left: 2023
- Diagonally top-right: 2079
- Diagonally bottom-left: 2028
- Diagonally bottom-right: 2080

Now, let's calculate the sum of these neighbors:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2081 + 2023 + 2079 + 2028 + 2080
\]

Breaking it down:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2081 + 2023 + 2079 + 2028 + 2080 = 16367
\]

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16367} \).
