To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the infinite spiral, let's first understand the structure of the spiral.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a counterclockwise manner. For a given number \( n \) in the spiral, we define its layer by considering the largest perfect square less than or equal to \( n \).

Let's denote the largest perfect square less than or equal to 2026 as \( k^2 \).

1. **Determine the layer:**
   \[
   k^2 \leq 2026 < (k+1)^2
   \]
   By solving this, we find:
   \[
   44^2 = 1936 \quad \text{and} \quad 45^2 = 2025
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   44^2 < 2026 \leq 45^2
   \]
   Hence, \( k = 45 \).

2. **Position in the layer:**
   Since \( 2026 = 45^2 + 1 \), 2026 is the first number in the next layer after 2025. This means 2026 is positioned right after the bottom-right corner of the \( 45 \times 45 \) square.

3. **Neighbors of 2026:**
   The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly adjacent to it in the spiral layout. Given its position, these neighbors are:
   \[
   2025, 2027, 2051, 2050, 2024, 2000, 1999, 2023
   \]
   These positions can be verified from the structure of the spiral:
   - \( 2025 \) (left)
   - \( 2027 \) (right)
   - \( 2051 \) (above-right)
   - \( 2050 \) (above)
   - \( 2024 \) (below)
   - \( 2000 \) (below-left)
   - \( 1999 \) (left below-left)
   - \( 2023 \) (left-below)

4. **Sum of the neighbors:**
   Now, let's calculate the sum:
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2051 + 2050 + 2024 + 2000 + 1999 + 2023
   \]
   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   2025 + 2027 = 4052
   \]
   \[
   4052 + 2051 = 6103
   \]
   \[
   6103 + 2050 = 8153
   \]
   \[
   8153 + 2024 = 10177
   \]
   \[
   10177 + 2000 = 12177
   \]
   \[
   12177 + 1999 = 14176
   \]
   \[
   14176 + 2023 = 16199
   \]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is:
\[
\boxed{16199}
\]
