To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral, we need to understand how numbers are positioned in the spiral on a square grid. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Spiral Layout:**
   - The spiral starts at the center with the number 1.
   - It then progresses outward in a clockwise direction.
   - The sequence of the spiral can be visualized as follows:
     ```
     17 16 15 14 13
     18  5  4  3 12
     19  6  1  2 11
     20  7  8  9 10
     21 22 23 24 25
     ```

2. **Identifying the Position of 2026:**
   - To find the position of 2026, we need to determine which layer of the spiral it is in.
   - The layers of the spiral can be thought of as squares of increasing size.
   - The side length of the \(n\)-th layer is \(2n-1\). For example, the 1st layer is \(1 \times 1\), the 2nd layer is \(3 \times 3\), the 3rd layer is \(5 \times 5\), and so on.
   - The total number of elements in the first \(n\) layers is \((2n-1)^2\).

3. **Calculating the Layer of 2026:**
   - We need to find \(n\) such that \((2n-1)^2 \leq 2026 < (2(n+1)-1)^2\).
   - Solving for \(n\):
     \[
     (2n-1)^2 \leq 2026 \implies 2n-1 \leq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \implies 2n \leq 46 \implies n \leq 23
     \]
   - Checking the bounds:
     \[
     (2 \cdot 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
     \]
     \[
     (2 \cdot 24 - 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
     \]
   - Since \(2025 < 2026 < 2209\), 2026 is in the 24th layer.

4. **Position of 2026 in the 24th Layer:**
   - The 24th layer starts at \(2025 + 1 = 2026\) and goes clockwise.
   - Therefore, 2026 is at the top-left corner of the 24th layer.

5. **Finding the Neighbors of 2026:**
   - The neighbors of 2026 in the spiral are the 8 numbers surrounding it.
   - Since 2026 is at the top-left corner of the 24th layer, its neighbors are:
     - Top-left corner of the previous layer (23rd layer): \(2025\)
     - The two numbers to the right of 2026 in the 24th layer: \(2027\) and \(2028\)
     - The three numbers below 2026 in the 24th layer: \(2052\), \(2051\), and \(2050\)
     - The two numbers to the left of 2026 in the 24th layer: \(2024\) and \(2023\)

6. **Sum of the Neighbors:**
   - The neighbors of 2026 are: \(2025, 2027, 2028, 2052, 2051, 2050, 2024, 2023\).
   - Summing these numbers:
     \[
     2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2052 + 2051 + 2050 + 2024 + 2023 = 16280
     \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16280} \).
