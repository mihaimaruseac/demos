To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a spiral grid, we need to first understand the structure of the grid and how the numbers are placed on it.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a square grid pattern as follows:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This pattern continues outward. To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine its position on the grid.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Layer:**
   - The number 2026 is relatively large, so it will be far from the center.
   - The numbers on the spiral can be thought of as being in layers. The first layer is the single number 1. The second layer is the numbers 2 through 9, the third layer is the numbers 10 through 25, and so on.
   - The number of elements in the \( n \)-th layer can be calculated as \( 8n - 8 \) (for \( n > 1 \)).

2. **Calculate the Layer:**
   - We need to find \( n \) such that the cumulative count of numbers up to the \( n \)-th layer includes 2026.
   - The cumulative count of numbers up to the \( n \)-th layer is given by \( (2n - 1)^2 \).
   - We solve \( (2n - 1)^2 \geq 2026 \).

   \[
   (2n - 1)^2 \geq 2026
   \]

   Taking the square root of both sides:

   \[
   2n - 1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45
   \]

   \[
   2n \geq 46
   \]

   \[
   n \geq 23
   \]

   So, 2026 is in the 23rd layer.

3. **Determine the Position in the Layer:**
   - The 23rd layer starts at \( (2 \times 23 - 3)^2 + 1 = 1937 \).
   - 2026 is \( 2026 - 1937 = 89 \) elements into the 23rd layer.
   - The 23rd layer has \( 8 \times 23 - 8 = 176 \) elements.

4. **Identify the Neighbors:**
   - Since 2026 is 89 elements into the 23rd layer, it is not at the corner or edge but somewhere in the middle of one of the sides.
   - The neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers directly adjacent to it in the grid.

5. **Calculate the Neighbors:**
   - The neighbors of 2026 are:
     - 2025 (left)
     - 2027 (right)
     - 2007 (up)
     - 2045 (down)
     - 2006 (up-left)
     - 2008 (up-right)
     - 2044 (down-left)
     - 2046 (down-right)

6. **Sum the Neighbors:**
   - Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2007 + 2045 + 2006 + 2008 + 2044 + 2046

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 2025 + 2027 + 2007 + 2045 + 2006 + 2008 + 2044 + 2046 = 16208
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16208} \).
