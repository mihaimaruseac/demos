To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral pattern laid out on a square grid, we need to understand the structure of the spiral.

1. **Understanding the Spiral Structure**:
   - The spiral starts at the center with the number 1.
   - It expands outward in a square pattern, adding layers of numbers as it grows.
   - The layers are added in a counterclockwise direction.

2. **Identifying the Layer**:
   - The number 2026 is relatively large, so it will be located in one of the outer layers of the spiral.
   - To find the exact layer, we need to determine the side length of the square layer that contains 2026.

3. **Calculating the Side Length**:
   - The side length of the square layer can be determined by finding the smallest odd integer \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is greater than or equal to 2026.
   - The sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \).
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( k^2 \geq 2026 \).

   \[
   k = \lceil \sqrt{2026} \rceil = \lceil 44.99 \rceil = 45
   \]

   So, the side length of the square layer is 45.

4. **Position of 2026 in the Layer**:
   - The layer with side length 45 contains numbers from \( (44)^2 + 1 = 1937 \) to \( (45)^2 = 2025 \).
   - The number 2026 is the first number in the next layer, which has a side length of 47.
   - Therefore, 2026 is located at the corner of the layer with side length 47.

5. **Finding the Neighbors**:
   - Since 2026 is at the corner of the layer, its neighbors will be the numbers adjacent to it in the spiral pattern.
   - The neighbors of 2026 are:
     - 2025 (previous number in the spiral)
     - 2027 (next number in the spiral)
     - 2009 (one row above and one column to the left)
     - 2010 (one row above)
     - 2011 (one row above and one column to the right)
     - 2049 (one column to the left)
     - 2050 (one column to the right)
     - 2077 (one row below)

6. **Summing the Neighbors**:
   - The sum of the neighbors is:

   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2009 + 2010 + 2011 + 2049 + 2050 + 2077
   \]

   Calculating the sum:

   \[
   2025 + 2027 = 4052
   \]

   \[
   2009 + 2010 + 2011 = 6030
   \]

   \[
   2049 + 2050 = 4099
   \]

   \[
   4052 + 6030 + 4099 + 2077 = 16258
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16258} \).
