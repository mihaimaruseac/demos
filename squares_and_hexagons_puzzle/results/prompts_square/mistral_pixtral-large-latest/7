To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral laid out on a square grid, we need to understand the structure of the spiral and determine the positions of the numbers around 2026.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   The spiral starts from the center and expands outward. The numbers increase sequentially as they spiral outward.

2. **Determine the Layer:**
   The number 2026 is not at the center but rather in one of the outer layers of the spiral. To find its exact position, we need to determine which layer it belongs to.

3. **Calculate the Layer:**
   The layers of the spiral can be visualized as squares with increasing side lengths. The side length of the \( n \)-th layer is \( 2n + 1 \). The total number of elements in the first \( n \) layers is \( (2n+1)^2 \).

   We need to find \( n \) such that:
   \[
   (2n+1)^2 \leq 2026 < (2(n+1)+1)^2
   \]

   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   (2n+1)^2 \leq 2026
   \]
   \[
   2n+1 \leq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45
   \]
   \[
   n \leq \frac{44}{2} = 22
   \]

   So, \( n = 22 \) because \( (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \) and \( (2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \).

4. **Position of 2026:**
   Since \( 2026 \) is just one more than \( 2025 \), it is the first number in the next layer (layer 23). The neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers adjacent to it in the spiral.

5. **Identify the Neighbors:**
   The neighbors of 2026 in the spiral are:
   - Directly above: 2025
   - Directly below: 2027
   - Directly left: 2017
   - Directly right: 2035
   - Diagonally above-left: 2016
   - Diagonally above-right: 2018
   - Diagonally below-left: 2034
   - Diagonally below-right: 2036

6. **Sum of the Neighbors:**
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2017 + 2035 + 2016 + 2018 + 2034 + 2036
   \]

   Calculating the sum:
   \[
   2025 + 2027 = 4052
   \]
   \[
   4052 + 2017 = 6069
   \]
   \[
   6069 + 2035 = 8104
   \]
   \[
   8104 + 2016 = 10120
   \]
   \[
   10120 + 2018 = 12138
   \]
   \[
   12138 + 2034 = 14172
   \]
   \[
   14172 + 2036 = 16208
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \( \boxed{16208} \).
