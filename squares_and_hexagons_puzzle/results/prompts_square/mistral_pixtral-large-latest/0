To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral and then identify its 8 neighbors.

1. **Identify the structure of the spiral:**
   The spiral starts at 1 and moves outward. The pattern of the spiral can be understood by looking at the layers (or "rings") around the central number 1:
   - The first ring contains only 1 number: \(1\).
   - The second ring contains 8 numbers: \(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\).
   - The third ring contains 16 numbers: \(10, 11, \ldots, 25\).
   - The fourth ring contains 24 numbers: \(26, 27, \ldots, 49\).
   - Generally, the \(n\)-th ring contains \(8(n-1)\) numbers.

2. **Calculate the ring for 2026:**
   We need to find which ring contains the number 2026. Let's denote the number of rings as \(n\). The total number of numbers up to the \(n\)-th ring is given by:
   \[
   1 + 8 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 1 + 8 \left(\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   1 + 4(n-1)n
   \]
   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1 + 4(n-1)n \leq 2026 < 1 + 4n(n+1)
   \]

3. **Estimate \(n\):**
   By trial and error or solving the quadratic inequality, we find that \(n = 23\) works:
   \[
   1 + 4 \times 22 \times 23 = 1 + 2024 = 2025
   \]
   Therefore, 2026 is the first number in the 24th ring.

4. **Determine the neighbors of 2026:**
   Since 2026 is the first number in the 24th ring, it is located at the bottom-right corner of the spiral. The neighbors of 2026 are:
   - The number directly to the left (2025).
   - The number directly above (2027).
   - The number diagonally above-left (2028).
   - The number diagonally above-right (2043).
   - The number directly below (2009).
   - The number diagonally below-left (2008).
   - The number diagonally below-right (2042).
   - The number directly to the right (2041).

5. **Sum the neighbors:**
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2043 + 2009 + 2008 + 2042 + 2041
   \]
   Calculating the sum:
   \[
   2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2043 + 2009 + 2008 + 2042 + 2041 = 16223
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(16223\).
