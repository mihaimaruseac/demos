The number 2026 is located at the start of the ring with index \(L = 23\) (since \(2026 = (2\cdot23-1)^2 + 1\)). For such a starting point on a ring with \(L \ge 2\), the sum of its eight neighbors is given by the formula \(S = 32L^2 + 24\). Substituting \(L = 23\):

\[
S = 32 \cdot 23^2 + 24 = 32 \cdot 529 + 24 = 16928 + 24 = 16952.
\]

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16952}\).
