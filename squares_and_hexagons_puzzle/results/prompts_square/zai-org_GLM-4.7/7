The natural numbers are written on a counterclockwise square spiral starting with 1 at the center, then moving right, up, left, left, down, down, right, right, and so on, with step lengths 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, … The given snippet:

```
5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9
```

matches this orientation when coordinates are taken with \(x\) increasing to the right and \(y\) increasing upward.

To find the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026, first determine its coordinates.  
The number \(n=2026\) lies in ring \(r\) where \((2r-1)^2 < n \le (2r+1)^2\).  
Since \(45^2 = 2025\) and \(47^2 = 2209\), we have \(r = 23\).  
The first number of ring \(r\) is at \((r,\,-(r-1))\); thus 2026 is at \((23,-22)\).

Now compute the numbers at the eight neighboring coordinates using the spiral mapping.  
For a point with ring radius \(s = \max(|x|,|y|)\), the number is \(\text{base}(s) + \text{offset}\), where \(\text{base}(s) = (2s-1)^2 + 1\) and the offset is determined by the point's position on the perimeter.

The neighbors and their values are:

| Coordinate          | Radius | Segment | Offset | Number |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| (24, -22)           | 24     | east    | 1      | 2211   |
| (22, -22)           | 22     | bottom  | 175    | 2025   |
| (23, -21)           | 23     | east    | 1      | 2027   |
| (23, -23)           | 23     | bottom  | 183    | 2209   |
| (24, -21)           | 24     | east    | 2      | 2212   |
| (22, -23)           | 23     | bottom  | 182    | 2208   |
| (24, -23)           | 24     | east    | 0      | 2210   |
| (22, -21)           | 22     | east    | 0      | 1850   |

Summing these values:

\[
2211 + 2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 2212 + 2208 + 2210 + 1850 = 16952.
\]

Thus the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{16952}\).
