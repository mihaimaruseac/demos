To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and determine the position of the number 2026. Once we know the position, we can easily identify the eight neighbors.

The spiral starts at 1 and goes clockwise. The numbers increase as we move away from the center. We can see that perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are always on the right side of the 1, and they mark the corners of the spiral. By looking at the differences between consecutive squares, we can determine how many numbers are on each side of the spiral.

Let's first find the perfect square closest to 2026. The square root of 2026 is approximately 45 (since 45^2 = 2025). This means that 2025 is on the right side of the spiral, and 2026 will be the next number in the spiral, which is directly above 2025.

Now, let's identify the eight neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is directly above 2025, the neighbors will be:

- 2027 (to the right of 2026)
- 2025 (below 2026)
- 2024 (to the left of 2026)
- 2023 (to the left of 2025)
- 2014 (two steps to the left of 2025)
- 2013 (two steps to the left and one step below 2025)
- 2014 (two steps to the left of 2024)
- 2015 (one step to the left of 2024)

Now we can add these numbers together to find the sum:

2027 + 2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2014 + 2013 + 2014 + 2015 = 16146

So, the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is 16146.
