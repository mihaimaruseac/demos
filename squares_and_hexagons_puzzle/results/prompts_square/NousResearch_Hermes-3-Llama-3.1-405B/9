To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and determine the positions of the numbers around 2026. The spiral starts at 1 and goes around in a clockwise direction.

Let's identify the numbers around 2026 step by step:

1. Determine the layer in which 2026 lies. The layers are defined by the odd squares (1, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, etc.). We need to find the smallest odd square greater than 2026. 

   45^2 = 2025, which is less than 2026.
   47^2 = 2209, which is greater than 2026.

   So, 2026 lies in the 47th layer.

2. Calculate the difference between 2026 and 2025 to find out how many steps into the 47th layer 2026 is.

   2026 - 2025 = 1

   This means 2026 is the first number in the 47th layer, located to the right of 2025 (the center of the bottom row of the layer).

3. Identify the neighbors:

   - Left neighbor: 2025
   - Top-left neighbor: 2025 - 46 = 1979 (since we're moving one layer in and one step to the left)
   - Top neighbor: 1979 - 1 = 1978 (since we're moving one step to the left)
   - Top-right neighbor: 1978 - 1 = 1977 (since we're moving one step to the left)
   - Right neighbor: 2027 (since we're moving one step to the right from 2026)
   - Bottom-right neighbor: 2027 + 46 = 2073 (since we're moving one layer out and one step to the right)
   - Bottom neighbor: 2073 + 1 = 2074 (since we're moving one step to the right)
   - Bottom-left neighbor: 2074 + 1 = 2075 (since we're moving one step to the right)

4. Sum the neighbors:

   2025 + 1979 + 1978 + 1977 + 2027 + 2073 + 2074 + 2075 = 16008

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16008.
