To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral and identify its neighbors.

The spiral pattern follows a sequence where each square ring around the center contains an odd number of values along each side. The center is 1, the next ring has 3, 3, 3, 3 (totaling 8 numbers, from 2 to 9), the next ring has 5, 5, 5, 5 (totaling 16 numbers, from 10 to 25), and so on.

The number of elements in each ring follows the sequence of odd squares: 1^2 = 1, 3^2 = 9, 5^2 = 25, etc. The difference between consecutive odd squares is the sequence of even numbers: 2^2 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 6^2 = 36, etc.

To find the ring in which 2026 falls, we can start by finding the next odd square after 2026. We know that 45^2 = 2025, so 2026 is just one number beyond that, putting it in the next ring, which starts with 2027 (which is 46^2).

Since 2026 is the first number in the 46th ring, it is located directly to the right of the center number of that ring (2025). Therefore, its neighbors will be the numbers immediately before and after it in the spiral (2025 and 2027), as well as the numbers in the rings immediately inside and outside it.

The neighbors in the outer ring (47th ring) will be 2026 + 46 (one step out and to the left) and 2026 + 46 + 46 (one step out and to the right), which are 2072 and 2118, respectively.

The neighbors in the inner ring (45th ring) will be 2026 - 44 (one step in and to the left) and 2026 - 44 - 44 (one step in and to the right), which are 1982 and 1938, respectively.

Now we can list all the neighbors:

- Directly above (in the 45th ring): 1982
- Directly below (in the 47th ring): 2072
- Directly left (in the 45th ring): 1938
- Directly right (in the 47th ring): 2118
- Top-left diagonal (in the 45th ring): 1977 (1982 - 5)
- Top-right diagonal (in the 45th ring): 1987 (1982 + 5)
- Bottom-left diagonal (in the 47th ring): 2067 (2072 - 5)
- Bottom-right diagonal (in the 47th ring): 2077 (2072 + 5)

Adding these together gives us the sum of all 8 neighbors:

1982 + 2072 + 1938 + 2118 + 1977 + 1987 + 2067 + 2077 = 16118

So the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16118.
