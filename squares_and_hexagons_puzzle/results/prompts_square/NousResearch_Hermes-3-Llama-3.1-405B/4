Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern of the spiral. The numbers increase as we move clockwise around the grid. Each time we complete a square ring, the size of the next ring increases by 2.

2) Let's identify which ring 2026 falls in. We can do this by finding the largest square number less than 2026, because each square ring ends with a square number.

   44^2 = 1936
   45^2 = 2025
   46^2 = 2116

   So, 2026 falls in the 45th ring.

3) If 2026 was at the corner of the ring, it would be equal to 45^2 = 2025. But since 2026 is one more than that, it must be the number immediately after the corner, on the same side.

4) Now, let's find the numbers adjacent to 2026. The numbers in the same ring will be 2025, 2027, and 2028. The numbers in the previous ring (44th ring) will be 2026 - 44 = 1982 and 1983. The numbers in the next ring (46th ring) will be 2026 + 46 = 2072 and 2071.

5) The sum of these 8 neighbors is:

   2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 1982 + 1983 + 2072 + 2071 + 1984 = 16052

Therefore, the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is 16052.
