To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral and then identify its 8 neighbors.

The spiral is formed by concentric "layers" around the center, with each layer being a square that wraps around the previous one. The center of the spiral is the number 1.

Let's look at the pattern of the last number in each layer:

- Layer 0 (the center): The last number is 1^2 = 1.
- Layer 1: The last number is 3^2 = 9.
- Layer 2: The last number is 5^2 = 25.
- Layer 3: The last number is 7^2 = 49.
- And so on...

The last numbers in each layer are the squares of the odd numbers. We can find the layer in which 2026 lies by finding the smallest odd square greater than 2026.

Let's find the smallest odd square greater than 2026:

63^2 = 3969 (too high)
61^2 = 3721 (too high)
59^2 = 3481 (too high)
57^2 = 3249 (too high)
55^2 = 3025 (too high)
53^2 = 2809 (too high)
51^2 = 2601 (too high)
49^2 = 2401 (still too high)
47^2 = 2209 (just right)

So, 2026 lies in the layer that ends with 2209.

Now, let's find out how many numbers are in the last row of this layer:

The last row starts with 47^2 - (47 - 1) = 2209 - 46 = 2163 (since we subtract one less than the side length of the square to get to the start of the last row).

So, 2026 is 2209 - 2026 = 183 numbers away from the end of this layer.

Since each side of the layer contains 47 numbers, 2026 is on the last row, 183 numbers from the end. To find its position on the row, we calculate 47 - 183 mod 47 = 47 - 11 = 36. This means 2026 is the 36th number on the last row.

Now that we know the number 2026 is on the last row and is the 36th number on that row, we can find its neighbors. The eight neighbors are: two on the same row, three on the row above, and three on the row below.

To find the sum of the neighbors, we need to calculate:

- The two neighbors on the same row: 2025 and 2027.
- The three neighbors on the row above: 2025 - 47, 2026 - 47, and 2027 - 47.
- The three neighbors on the row below: 2025 - 47 - 47, 2026 - 47 - 47, and 2027 - 47 - 47.

Let's calculate the sum:

2025 + 2027 + (2025 - 47) + (2026 - 47) + (2027 - 47) + (2025 - 94) + (2026 - 94) + (2027 - 94)
= 2025 + 2027 + 1978 + 1979 + 1980 + 1931 + 1932 + 1933
= 16175

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16175.
