To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral.

We can do this by finding the "ring" or "layer" that 2026 is on. The spiral can be thought of as concentric squares, with the first ring being the numbers 2 through 9 (since 1 is the center and not part of any ring). Each subsequent ring adds 8 more numbers than the previous ring. The number of elements in each ring follows the sequence 8, 16, 24,..., which can be represented by the formula 8n, where n is the ring number.

The number of elements up to ring n is the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (first \ term + last \ term) \]
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (8 + 8n) \]
\[ S_n = 4n(n + 1) \]

We want to find the smallest n such that 2026 is less than or equal to \( 4n(n + 1) \). We can find this by trial and error or by solving the quadratic inequality \( 4n^2 + 4n - 2026 \geq 0 \).

Let's solve for n:
\[ 4n^2 + 4n - 2026 \geq 0 \]
\[ n^2 + n - 506.5 \geq 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula, we can find the roots of the corresponding equation:
\[ n = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 506.5}}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2026}}{2} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \), the positive root is:
\[ n = \frac{-1 + 45}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{44}{2} \]
\[ n = 22 \]

So, 2026 is in the 22nd ring. Now we need to find its position within that ring. The last number in the 21st ring is given by \( 4 \times 21 \times (21 + 1) \), which is \( 1848 \). So, 2026 is the \( 2026 - 1848 = 178th \) number in the 22nd ring.

Each ring starts on the bottom left corner and goes up, then right, then down, then left. Since each side of the 22nd ring has \( 2 \times 22 \) numbers, we can find the position of 2026 by counting how many sides and numbers we pass.

The first side (going up) has 22 numbers, the second side (going right) also has 22 numbers, and the third side (going down) has 22 numbers. Since 178 is less than \( 3 \times 22 = 66 \), 2026 is on the fourth side (going left).

Now, let's find the neighbors. Since we are going left, the number immediately to the left is 2025, and the number to the right is 2027. The numbers above and below are part of the 21st and 23rd rings, respectively. To find the number above, we subtract 22 from 2025, and to find the number below, we add 22 to 2027.

The number above 2025 is 2025 - 22 = 2003, and the number below 2027 is 2027 + 22 = 2049.

Now we have:
- Upper left: 2003 - 1 = 2002
- Directly above: 2003
- Upper right: 2003 + 1 = 2004
- Directly left: 2025
- Directly right: 2027
- Lower left: 2049 - 1 = 2048
- Directly below: 2049
- Lower right: 2049 + 1 = 2050

The sum of all 8 neighbors is:
\[ 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2025 + 2027 + 2048 + 2049 + 2050 \]
\[ = 16108 \]

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16108.
