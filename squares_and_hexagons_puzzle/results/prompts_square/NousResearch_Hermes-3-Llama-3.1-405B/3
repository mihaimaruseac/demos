To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

The spiral is formed by starting with 1 and then wrapping around it in a clockwise direction, adding numbers as we go. Each time we complete a "ring" around the center, we increase the size of the square by 2 in both width and height. The number of elements in each ring follows a pattern: 8, 16, 24,... which is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 8.

To find out in which ring 2026 falls, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the nth term. Since the first term \( a_1 \) is 8 (the number of elements in the first ring), we can express \( a_n \) as \( 8 + 8(n-1) \) because the common difference is 8.

We want to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( S_n \) is greater than or equal to 2026 - 1 (since we start counting from 1, not 0). Let's solve for \( n \):

\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (8 + 8 + 8(n-1)) \geq 2026 - 1 \]
\[ S_n = 4n(1 + n - 1) \geq 2025 \]
\[ S_n = 4n^2 \geq 2025 \]
\[ n^2 \geq \frac{2025}{4} \]
\[ n^2 \geq 506.25 \]
\[ n \geq \sqrt{506.25} \]
\[ n \geq 22.5 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 23. This means 2026 is in the 23rd ring.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 23rd ring. The number of elements up to the 22nd ring is:

\[ S_{22} = 4 \times 22^2 = 4 \times 484 = 1936 \]

So, 2026 is the \( 2026 - 1936 = 90 \)th number in the 23rd ring.

Each ring has four sides, and since we're looking for the 90th number, it falls on the fourth side of the 23rd ring (since \( 90 > 23 \times 3 \)). The numbers on the fourth side of the ring decrease as we move clockwise, so the neighbors of 2026 will be:

- The number immediately before 2026: 2027
- The number immediately after 2026: 2025
- The number on the next inner ring (22nd ring) corresponding to 2025: 2025 - 2(22) = 1981
- The number on the next inner ring (22nd ring) corresponding to 2027: 2027 - 2(22) = 1983
- The number on the next outer ring (24th ring) corresponding to 2025: 2025 + 2(23) = 2071
- The number on the next outer ring (24th ring) corresponding to 2027: 2027 + 2(23) = 2073
- The number on the same ring but on the opposite side, corresponding to 2025: 2026 - 2(23) = 1980
- The number on the same ring but on the opposite side, corresponding to 2027: 2026 - 2(23 - 1) = 1982

Now, we can sum these neighbors:

\[ 2027 + 2025 + 1981 + 1983 + 2071 + 2073 + 1980 + 1982 = 16022 \]

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16022.
