To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

The spiral is formed by starting at 1 and moving in a clockwise direction, adding one layer at each step. Each layer is composed of a square that wraps around the previous layer, and each side of the square contains the same number of numbers as the previous layer's total perimeter plus one.

The layers are as follows:
- Layer 0: 1 (the center)
- Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
-...

Each layer starts with a square number (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc.), and the difference between consecutive square numbers increases by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).

To find the layer in which 2026 is located, we can look for the smallest square number greater than 2026. The square root of 2026 is approximately 45, so the next square number is 46^2 = 2116. This means 2026 is in the layer that ends with 2116.

Now, let's find the position of 2026 within this layer. The previous square number is 45^2 = 2025, so 2026 is the first number in the layer that ends with 2116. This means 2026 is on the bottom-left corner of the square.

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (left)
- 2027 (right)
- 2024 (bottom)
- 2023 (bottom-left)
- 2022 (left of 2023)
- 2071 (top-left, which is 46 - 1 = 45 numbers away from 2026)
- 2072 (top, which is 46 numbers away from 2026)
- 2073 (top-right, which is 46 + 1 = 47 numbers away from 2026)

Now, we can calculate the sum of the neighbors:
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2071 + 2072 + 2073 = 16197
