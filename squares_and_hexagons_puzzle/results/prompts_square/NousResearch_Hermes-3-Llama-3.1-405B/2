To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral.

The spiral is formed by adding layers around the central 1. Each layer is a square that wraps around the previous layer. The corners of each layer are perfect squares, and the layers alternate between odd and even squares. The layers start with the square of the odd numbers: 1^2=1, 3^2=9, 5^2=25, etc.

Let's find the odd square root that is just greater than 2026, which will tell us in which layer 2026 is located.

Calculating the square roots of the odd numbers:

- 45^2 = 2025 (too small)
- 47^2 = 2209 (too big)

So, 2026 is in the layer that ends with 47^2. The square 45^2 is the last number of the previous layer, so the numbers from 2025 to 2209 form the layer that contains 2026.

The difference between 2026 and 2025 is 1, which means 2026 is the first number after the corner on the bottom row of this layer. Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 are as follows:

- Directly above: 2026 - 45 = 1981
- Directly below: 2026 + 45 = 2071
- To the left: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- To the right: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- Top-left diagonal: 1981 - 1 = 1980
- Top-right diagonal: 1981 + 1 = 1982
- Bottom-left diagonal: 2071 - 1 = 2070
- Bottom-right diagonal: 2071 + 1 = 2072

Now, we can sum these neighbors:

1981 + 2071 + 2025 + 2027 + 1980 + 1982 + 2070 + 2072 = 16108

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16108.
