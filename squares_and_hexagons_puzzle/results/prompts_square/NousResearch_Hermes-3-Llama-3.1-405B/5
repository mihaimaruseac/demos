Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand the pattern of the spiral. The numbers are filled in a clockwise direction, starting from the center. After each complete round, the size of the square increases by 2.

2) Now, let's determine which round 2026 falls in. We can do this by finding the largest odd square number less than 2026.

   43^2 = 1849
   45^2 = 2025

   So, 2026 falls in the round starting from 1849 and ending at 2025+44 = 2069.

3) In this round, 2026 falls between 2025 (the square of 45) and 2069. The numbers between 2025 and 2069 are on the bottom row of this round.

4) The neighbors of 2026 will be:

   - 2025 and 2027 (on the same row)
   - 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (on the row above)
   - 2030, 2029, and 2028 (on the row below)

5) Now, let's add these numbers:

   2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2030 + 2029 + 2028 = 16209

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16209.
