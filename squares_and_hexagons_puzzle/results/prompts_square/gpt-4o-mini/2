To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the given spiral grid, we first need to identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral.

### Step 1: Determine the position of 2026

The pattern of the spiral numbers can be observed through layers. Each complete layer can be identified by the largest number it contains. The structure is as follows:

- The first layer contains numbers from 1 to \(1^2 = 1\).
- The second layer contains numbers from \(2^2 - 3 = 4\) to \(3^2 - 1 = 9\).
- The third layer contains numbers from \(3^2 + 1 = 10\) to \(4^2 - 1 = 16\).
- The nth layer will contain numbers from \((n-1)^2 + 1\) to \(n^2\).

To find which layer contains the number 2026, we check the bounds of the layers:
\[
n^2 \geq 2026 \implies n \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 44.94 \implies n \geq 45.
\]
Calculating \(n = 45\):
\[
45^2 = 2025.
\]
Thus, the largest number in the 45th layer is 2025. The numbers in the 45th layer range from 2026 (the smallest) to \(46^2 - 1 = 2115\).

### Step 2: Locate 2026 in the grid

For the \(n = 45\) layer, the positions of numbers are placed around it in a specific order:
- The bottom row (from left to right) starts from \(2026\) going up to \(2025\) (topmost). 

The 2026 can be positioned as follows, starting from 2013 at the bottom layer:
```
2036 2035 2034 2033 2032
2037 2024 2023 2022 2031
2038 2025 2026 2021 2030
2039 2040 2041 2042 2043
...
```

### Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors

Here we note the direct neighbors (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) of the number 2026:
- Up (2025)
- Down (2027)
- Left (2024)
- Right (2028)
- Upper Left (2024)
- Upper Right (2027)
- Lower Left (2024)
- Lower Right (2028)

So the neighbors of \(2026\) are:
- 2025 (above)
- 2024 (left)
- 2027 (below)
- 2028 (right)
- 2023 (upper right diagonal)
- 2029 (lower right diagonal)
- 2025 (upper left diagonal)
- 2027 (lower left diagonal).

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of these neighbors

Summing these values:
\[
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2026 + 2026 
= (2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 + 2034 + 2035 + 2036) - (2026)\\
= 203.4 + 203.4 + 203.4 + 203.4 +1*0 + 2026
= 2025 + 2024 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032\\
= 16217.
\]

The total sum of the neighbors of \(2026\) is \(16217\).

Therefore, the final answer is

**Answer: The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(16217\).**
