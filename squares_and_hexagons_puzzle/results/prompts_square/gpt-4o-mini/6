To find the neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral layout, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral. The numbers are arranged in a counter-clockwise direction starting from 1 at the center. The sequence of layers in the spiral progresses as follows:

- The first layer contains 1 (i.e., \(1^2\)).
- The second layer contains 2 through 9 (the next square, \(3^2\) which is 9).
- The third layer contains 10 through 25 (the next square, \(5^2\) which is 25).
- The fourth layer contains 26 through 49 (the next square, \(7^2\) which is 49).
- The fifth layer contains 50 through 81 (the next square, \(9^2\) which is 81).
- The sixth layer contains 82 through 122 (the next square, \(11^2\) which is 121).
  
Continuing this, we need to determine which layer contains the number 2026:

- The sequence follows the formula for the last number in the \(n\)-th layer: \(n^2\)
  
We check what \(n\) satisfies \(n^2 < 2026 < (n+1)^2\):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.0
\]

Calculating the squares gives:

- \(44^2 = 1936\) (less than 2026)
- \(45^2 = 2025\) (less than 2026)
- \(46^2 = 2116\) (greater than 2026)

Thus, 2026 is located in the 46th layer because \(2025 < 2026 < 2116\).

Next, we identify the corners of the current layer (n=46):
- The bottom-right corner is \(46^2 = 2116\),
- The bottom-left corner is \(2116 - 45 = 2071\),
- The top-left corner is \(2071 - 45 = 2026\),
- The top-right corner is \(2026 - 45 = 1981\).

The positions in this layer can be visualized as follows:
  
**Layer 46 positions** (counter-clockwise)
1. \(2116\) (bottom-right corner),
2. \(2071\) (bottom-left corner),
3. \(2026\) (top-left corner),
4. \(1981\) (top-right corner).

Next, we can determine the neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are:
- \((2025, 2027)\): directly left (2025) and directly right (2027).
- \((1981, 1982)\): directly above (1981) and directly below (1982).
- \((2071, 2072)\): directly above-left (2071) and directly below-left (2072).

Thus, the neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (left),
- 2027 (right),
- 1981 (above),
- 1982 (below),
- 2071 (top-left),
- 2072 (bottom-left).

To find the exact neighbors:
- 2025, 2027 (direct neighbors),
- 1981 (directly above),
- 1982 (directly below),
- 2071 and 2072.

Now let's compute the sum:

\[
2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1982 + 2071 + 2072 = 12158.
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{12158}.
