To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid of natural numbers, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 within the spiral.

The spiral starts at 1 at the center, and the shell layers expand outward as follows:

1. The first layer (1) is just the center.
2. The second layer (2 to 9) forms a 3x3 grid surrounding 1.
3. The third layer (10 to 25) forms a 5x5 grid surrounding the previous layer.
4. The fourth layer (26 to 49) forms a 7x7 grid surrounding the previous layer.
5. The fifth layer (50 to 81) forms a 9x9 grid surrounding the previous layer.
6. The sixth layer (82 to 121) forms an 11x11 grid surrounding the previous layer.
7. And so on.

For any layer \( n \), the total number of elements it contains is \( (2n - 1) \times (2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 \), with the maximum number in layer \( n \) being \( (2n - 1)^2 \).

We can determine which layer contains the number 2026:

To get an approximate value of \( n \):

\[
(2n - 1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Taking the square root, we solve:

\[
2n - 1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2n \geq 46 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \geq 23
\]

Now checking \( n = 23 \):

\[
(2 \times 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]
and checking \( n = 24 \):

\[
(2 \times 24 - 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

Since \( 2025 \) is the maximum number in layer 23, and it contains all numbers from \( 2026 \) to \( 2209 \), we confirm that 2026 is in layer 24.

Next, for layer 24:
- The minimum number in layer 24 is \( 2026 \).
- The maximum number in layer 24 is \( 2209 (=(2 \cdot 24 - 1)^2) \).

Now we need to find the coordinates of 2026:

The layer structure proceeds as:
- \( (2k - 1) \) is the side length of the layer k, starting with:
1. Top-right corner: \( \text{(k, k)} \)
2. Top-left corner: \( \text{(k, -k+1)} \)
3. Bottom-left corner: \( \text{(-k+1, -k+1)} \)
4. Bottom-right corner: \( \text{(-k+1, k)} \)

Coordinates for number in layer \( n \):
- The bottom-right corner of layer \( n \) is \( (n, n) \).
- Moving counter-clockwise along layer \( n \):
1. Starting from bottom-right \( (n, n) \) numbering decreases.
2. Left to bottom-left.
3. Up to top-left.
4. Right to top-right.

Next, find coordinates of 2026:

The total elements in layers 1 to 23 is \( 2025 \). Thus, the number 2026 is the first in layer 24 with full coordinates \( (12, -12) \). The spiral will place 2026 in a certain sequence around the corner.

Following the structure, the neighbors of 2026 (8 surrounding cells) are:
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Up: 1983
- Down: 2107
- Up-Left: 1984
- Up-Right: 1982
- Down-Left: 2106
- Down-Right: 2108

Calculating these neighbors:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 1983 + 2107 + 1984 + 1982 + 2106 + 2108
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:

\[
2025 + 2027 = 4052
\]
\[
4052 + 1983 = 6035
\]
\[
6035 + 2107 = 8142
\]
\[
8142 + 1984 = 10126
\]
\[
10126 + 1982 = 12108
\]
\[
12108 + 2106 = 14214
\]
\[
14214 + 2108 = 16322
\]

Thus, the desired sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{16322}
\]
