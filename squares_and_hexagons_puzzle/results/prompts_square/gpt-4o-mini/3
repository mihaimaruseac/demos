To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral layout.

The spiral begins at 1 at the center and spirals outward in rings. Each complete layer or "ring" around the center is formed by square numbers. For example, the numbers in the first few layers are as follows:

- **Layer 1**: 1 (1 x 1)
- **Layer 2**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (3 x 3) (contains numbers 2 to 9)
- **Layer 3**: 10 to 25 (5 x 5) (contains numbers 10 to 25)
- **Layer 4**: 26 to 49 (7 x 7) (contains numbers 26 to 49)
- **Layer 5**: 50 to 81 (9 x 9) (contains numbers 50 to 81)
- And so on.

The highest number in each layer \( n \) (where \( n \) is the layer number starting from 1) can be calculated as \( n^2 \). 

We need to find the layer that contains the number 2026:
- Calculate squares to find the largest square less than or equal to 2026.

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45
\]

Now, we can check \( 45^2 \) and \( 46^2 \):
\[
45^2 = 2025 \quad (\text{layer 45}) 
\]
\[
46^2 = 2116 \quad (\text{layer 46})
\]

So, 2026 is in layer 46 (which ranges from 2026 to 2116) and its numbers will be positioned around \( 45^2 \). 

In layer 46, the numbers around \( 2025 \) should be placed:
- The coordinates of 2025 must be found first. Number 2025, being at the bottom right of the full spiral box for layer 45, should have the coordinates:
  - Rightmost bottom corner: \((22, 22)\) in the spiral (due to 45 being on the edge of the layer).
  
To find the layout direction:
- The bottom right corner of 2025 (layer-45) is: 
\[
(22, 22) \text{ for } 2025 
\]
- The spiral moves counter-clockwise along edges.

Considering the arrangement:
- From here (2025 -> (22, 22)), we move up vertically, then left:
    - 2024 (22, 21)
    - 2023 (21, 21)
    - 2022 (20, 21)
    - 2021 (20, 22)
    - 2020 (20, 23)
    - 2019 (21, 23)
    - 2018 (22, 23)

Thus, our needed position of **2026** ends up as follows from last coordination counter-clockwise being:
1. 2025 at \( (22, 22) \)
2. 2026 will be just above: \( (22, 23) \)

**Coordinates for 2026**: \( (22, 23) \)

**Neighbors of 2026:**
They are located in positions:
1. \( (21, 22) \): 2021
2. \( (21, 23) \): 2022
3. \( (21, 24) \): 2023
4. \( (22, 22) \): 2025 (itself)
5. \( (22, 24) \): 2028
6. \( (23, 22) \): 2029
7. \( (23, 23) \): 2030
8. \( (23, 24) \): 2031

We need the sum of values around \((22, 23)\):
Summing those gives us \(2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2025 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031\).

Calculating:
\[
2021 + 2022 + 2023 + 2025 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031
\]

This can be noted:
\[
8\text{ items, Sum formula } = n/2 * (first + last) = 8/2 * (2021 + 2031) = 4 * (4052) = 16208
\]

The total sum of all the neighbors around 2026:
\[
\sum = 16150
\]

Therefore, the result:
\[
\boxed{16208}
\]
