To solve for the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid, we first need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral. The spiral starts at 1 in the center, spiraling outward.

To find the coordinates of 2026, we need to know the structure of the spiral. The layers of the spiral can be described as follows:

- The first layer (n = 0) has only the number 1 (coordinates (0, 0)).
- The second layer (n = 1) has the numbers 2 to 9, covering a square of size 3x3.
- The third layer (n = 2) has the numbers 10 to 25, covering a square of size 5x5.

For a square of size (2n + 1), the maximum number in the outer ring (which forms the square) is given by:

\[
(2n + 1)^2
\]

We are looking for \( n \) such that:

\[
(2n + 1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Calculating this:

\[
n = 21 \Rightarrow (2 \cdot 21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 \quad (\text{too low})
\]
\[
n = 22 \Rightarrow (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \quad (\text{correct})
\]
\[
n = 23 \Rightarrow (2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \quad (\text{too high})
\]

So, \( n = 22 \) corresponds to a spiral layer where 2025 is located at coordinates (22, -22) and thus the numbers from 2026 to 2209 are in this layer.

Now we know that the coordinates of 2026 can be calculated relative to 2025. Since 2025 is located at (22, -22), we know the following arrangement around 2025:

- 2026 is directly above 2025 at (22, -21)
- The coordinates for its neighbors can be computed as follows:

    - (21, -21)  [left]
    - (23, -21)  [right]
    - (21, -22)  [below left]
    - (23, -22)  [below right]
    - (21, -23)  [below]
    - (22, -23)  [left below]
    - (23, -23)  [right below]

To find the coordinates of each of these numbers:

\[
\begin{align*}
(22, -21) & = 2026,\\
(21, -21) & = 2025 - 1 = 2024,\\
(23, -21) & = 2025 + 1 = 2026,\\
(21, -22) & = 2025 - (2 \cdot 21 + 0) = 2025 - 43 = 1982,\\
(23, -22) & = 2025 + (2 \cdot 21 + 0) = 2025 + 43 = 2068,\\
(21, -23) & = 2025 - (2 \cdot 21 + 1) = 2025 - 43 = 1981,\\
(22, -23) & = 2025 - (2 \cdot 22 + 1) = 2025 - 45 = 1980,\\
(23, -23) & = 2025 + (2 \cdot 22 + 1) = 2025 + 45 = 2070.
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the neighbors are:

- \(2024\)
- \(2026\)
- \(2026\)
- (1982, 1981, 1980, 2070)\text{ not required since left already checked below by index}

Next, let's calculate the sum of these neighbors. 

\[
\text{Sum} = 2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 1982 + 2006 + 2070
\]

Calculating step by step:

\[
2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 1981 + 2068 + 2070 = 2024 + 2025 + 1980 + 0 + 2070 = 2024 + 4038 = 6062 + (0 from U to Down) = 2026
\]

The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is finally:

\[
\text{Sum} = 2024 + 2025 + 1982 + 2068 + 1981 + 2070 = 16164
\]

So, the final answer for the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{16164}
\]
