To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral grid of natural numbers, we first need to determine the coordinates of the number 2026 within that spiral structure.

The spiral structure begins with 1 at the center and moves outward in a clockwise manner. The numbers increase layer by layer, forming concentric squares. Each layer can be identified by its "ring" number \( n \), where:

- Ring \( n = 0 \) has just 1 at \( (0, 0) \).
- Ring \( n = 1 \) contains numbers from 2 to 9.
- Ring \( n = 2 \) contains numbers from 10 to 25.
- Ring \( n = 3 \) contains numbers from 26 to 49.
- And so on...

For a given ring \( n \), the top right corner of that ring is given by:

\[
(2n + 1)^2
\]

To find the correct ring for the number \( 2026 \):

1. Find \( n \) such that \( (2n + 1)^2 < 2026 \) and \( (2(n + 1) + 1)^2 \geq 2026 \).
   
Calculating for \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1)^2 = 7^2 = 49 \)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \)
- For \( n = 5 \): \( (2 \cdot 5 + 1)^2 = 11^2 = 121 \)
- For \( n = 6 \): \( (2 \cdot 6 + 1)^2 = 13^2 = 169 \)
- For \( n = 7 \): \( (2 \cdot 7 + 1)^2 = 15^2 = 225 \)
- For \( n = 8 \): \( (2 \cdot 8 + 1)^2 = 17^2 = 289 \)
- For \( n = 9 \): \( (2 \cdot 9 + 1)^2 = 19^2 = 361 \)
- For \( n = 10 \): \( (2 \cdot 10 + 1)^2 = 21^2 = 441 \)
- For \( n = 11 \): \( (2 \cdot 11 + 1)^2 = 23^2 = 529 \)
- For \( n = 12 \): \( (2 \cdot 12 + 1)^2 = 25^2 = 625 \)
- For \( n = 13 \): \( (2 \cdot 13 + 1)^2 = 27^2 = 729 \)
- For \( n = 14 \): \( (2 \cdot 14 + 1)^2 = 29^2 = 841 \)
- For \( n = 15 \): \( (2 \cdot 15 + 1)^2 = 31^2 = 961 \)
- For \( n = 16 \): \( (2 \cdot 16 + 1)^2 = 33^2 = 1089 \)
- For \( n = 17 \): \( (2 \cdot 17 + 1)^2 = 35^2 = 1225 \)
- For \( n = 18 \): \( (2 \cdot 18 + 1)^2 = 37^2 = 1369 \)
- For \( n = 19 \): \( (2 \cdot 19 + 1)^2 = 39^2 = 1521 \)
- For \( n = 20 \): \( (2 \cdot 20 + 1)^2 = 41^2 = 1681 \)
- For \( n = 21 \): \( (2 \cdot 21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 \)
- For \( n = 22 \): \( (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \)
- For \( n = 23 \): \( (2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \)

Thus, 2026 is in ring \( n = 22 \), as \( 2025 \) is the top right corner of that ring.

For ring 22, the numbers are arranged as follows:
- Top right corner is 2025 (at coordinates \( (22, -22) \))
- Top left corner is \( 2025 - 22 = 2003 \) (at coordinates \( (-22, -22) \))
- Bottom left corner is \( 2025 - 22 - 22 = 1981 \) (at coordinates \( (-22, 22) \))
- Bottom right corner is \( 2025 - 22 - 22 - 22 = 1963 \) (at coordinates \( (22, 22) \))

Going from the top right corner, we move downwards through the coordinates, giving us the following:

From the top right, the numbers proceed like so:
- Top edge from (22, -22) leftwards (2025 to 2004):
  - (21, -22) = 2004
  - (20, -22) = 2003

Continuing around, we count backwards to map out the entire ring.

The coordinates for \( 2026 \) are found at:
\[
(22, -21) \ \text{and it is located at} \ 2026.
\]
Its neighbors are directly around these coordinates:

- Up (21, -21)
- Down (23, -21)
- Left (22, -22)
- Right (22, -20)
- Up-Left (21, -22)
- Up-Right (21, -20)
- Down-Left (23, -22)
- Down-Right (23, -20)

Calculating from above data:
1. Up: 2005
2. Down: 2047
3. Left: 2025
4. Right: 2027
5. Up-Left: 2004
6. Up-Right: 2006
7. Down-Left: 2046
8. Down-Right: 2048

Now compute the total:

\[
\text{Sum} = 2005 + 2047 + 2025 + 2027 + 2004 + 2006 + 2046 + 2048
\]

Calculating:
\[
2005 + 2047 + 2025 + 2027 + 2004 + 2006 + 2046 + 2048 = 16208,
\]

thus the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16208}.
