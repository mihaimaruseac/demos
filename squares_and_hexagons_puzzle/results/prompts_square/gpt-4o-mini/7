To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral grid, we first need to determine the position of the number 2026. The number spirals outwards, layer by layer, starting from the center (which is 1).

The spiral grid is arranged in increasingly larger squares. Each complete layer \( n \) (where \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \)) corresponds to the size of the square formed by the numbers at that layer. The specific quantities of numbers at each layer can be calculated as follows:

- The total number of elements in layer \( n \) is:
\[
(2n + 1)^2 - (2(n-1) + 1)^2 = (2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 4n
\]
This formula shows that the \( n \)-th layer contains \( 4n \) numbers.

We can determine how many complete layers there are before reaching 2026. Specifically, we find which is the largest \( n \) such that:
\[
1 + 4\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n} k\right) < 2026
\]
This summation leads to the numbers from the center up to the layer \( n \):
\[
1 + 4\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 + 2n(n + 1)
\]

To find \( n \), we solve the inequality:
\[
1 + 2n(n + 1) < 2026 \implies 2n(n + 1) < 2025 \implies n(n + 1) < 1012.5
\]

Let’s test values for \( n \):

- For \( n = 31 \):
\[
31 \cdot 32 = 992 \quad (\text{valid})
\]
- For \( n = 32 \):
\[
32 \cdot 33 = 1056 \quad (\text{invalid})
\]

Thus, the maximum layer is \( n = 31 \). 

The highest number at layer \( n = 31 \):
\[
1 + 4 \cdot \frac{31 \cdot 32}{2} = 1 + 4 \cdot 496 = 1985
\]

The highest number at layer \( n = 32 \):
\[
1 + 4 \cdot \frac{32 \cdot 33}{2} = 1 + 4 \cdot 528 = 2113
\]

Thus, 2026 is located between 1985 and 2113, specifically in layer 32.

Next, we need to find the position of 2026 in this layer. The bottom-right corner of layer 32 is 2113.

The sequence of numbers in layer 32 follows this order:
- **From 1986 to 2017:** (left side) -> 1986 to 1999
- **From 2000 to 2013:** (top side) -> 2000 to 2013
- **From 2014 to 2113:** (right side) -> 2014 to 2113

Enumerating, we find 2026 produces relative positions and neighbors.

To list the surrounding positions:
- 2015 (left)
- 2016 (left)
- 2017 (left)
- 2000 (top)
- 2001 (top)
- 2002 (top)
- 2014 (down)
- 2015 (down)
- 2016 (down)

Now we can sum all unique neighbors:

- Neighbors of 2026:
  - 2025
  - 2027
  - 2028
  - 2029
  - 2000
  - 2001
  - 2002

The sum is:
\[
2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 1985
\]

Calculating the precise neighbors by confirming:
2026's neighbors are:
- 2025
- 2027
- 2028
- 2029
- 2000 
- 2001 
- 2002 
- 2014 

Thus the sum:
\[
\text{Sum} = 2015 + 2016 + 2017 + 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2028 
= 16074
\]

Final calculation:
Each of which outputs the final result asserting:
\[
\boxed{16142}
\] as total numbers surrounding 2023.
