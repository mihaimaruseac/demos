To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral, we first need to identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral.

The spiral structure grows in layers. Each layer \( n \) consists of the numbers making up the square of size \( 2n + 1 \). The largest number in the \( n \)-th layer is given by the formula:

\[
(2n + 1)^2
\]

The outermost layers can be represented as follows:

- For \( n = 0 \), largest number is \( 1^2 = 1 \) (just the center).
- For \( n = 1 \), largest number is \( 3^2 = 9 \) (numbers 2 through 9).
- For \( n = 2 \), largest number is \( 5^2 = 25 \) (numbers 10 through 25).
- For \( n = 3 \), largest number is \( 7^2 = 49 \) (numbers 26 through 49).
- For \( n = 4 \), largest number is \( 9^2 = 81 \) (numbers 50 through 81).
- For \( n = 5 \), largest number is \( 11^2 = 121 \) (numbers 82 through 121).
- For \( n = 6 \), largest number is \( 13^2 = 169 \) (numbers 122 through 169).
- For \( n = 7 \), largest number is \( 15^2 = 225 \) (numbers 170 through 225).
- For \( n = 8 \), largest number is \( 17^2 = 289 \) (numbers 226 through 289).
- For \( n = 9 \), largest number is \( 19^2 = 361 \) (numbers 290 through 361).
- For \( n = 10 \), largest number is \( 21^2 = 441 \) (numbers 362 through 441).
- For \( n = 11 \), largest number is \( 23^2 = 529 \) (numbers 442 through 529).
- For \( n = 12 \), largest number is \( 25^2 = 625 \) (numbers 530 through 625).
- For \( n = 13 \), largest number is \( 27^2 = 729 \) (numbers 626 through 729).
- For \( n = 14 \), largest number is \( 29^2 = 841 \) (numbers 730 through 841).
- For \( n = 15 \), largest number is \( 31^2 = 961 \) (numbers 842 through 961).
- For \( n = 16 \), largest number is \( 33^2 = 1089 \) (numbers 962 through 1089).
- For \( n = 17 \), largest number is \( 35^2 = 1225 \) (numbers 1090 through 1225).
- For \( n = 18 \), largest number is \( 37^2 = 1369 \) (numbers 1226 through 1369).
- For \( n = 19 \), largest number is \( 39^2 = 1521 \) (numbers 1370 through 1521).
- For \( n = 20 \), largest number is \( 41^2 = 1681 \) (numbers 1522 through 1681).
- For \( n = 21 \), largest number is \( 43^2 = 1849 \) (numbers 1682 through 1849).
- For \( n = 22 \), largest number is \( 45^2 = 2025 \) (numbers 1850 through 2025).
- For \( n = 23 \), largest number is \( 47^2 = 2209 \) (numbers 2026 through 2209).

This shows that 2026 is located in the 23rd layer. The maximum number in the 22nd layer is 2025. Thus, the numbers in the 23rd layer going around and outwards from 2026 are as follows:

```
...
    [2023, 2024, 2025]
    [2022, 2026, 2027]
    [2021, 2028, 2029]
...
```

Using the relative positions we established, the neighbors of 2026 are:

- Above: 2022
- Below: 2028
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Top-left: 2021
- Top-right: 2024
- Bottom-left: 2029
- Bottom-right: 2030

Now we calculate the sum of these neighbors:

\[
2021 + 2022 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030
\]

Calculating this step by step:

1. \(2021 + 2022 = 4043\)
2. \(4043 + 2024 = 6067\)
3. \(6067 + 2025 = 8092\)
4. \(8092 + 2027 = 10119\)
5. \(10119 + 2028 = 12147\)
6. \(12147 + 2029 = 14176\)
7. \(14176 + 2030 = 16106\)

Thus, the total sum of all neighbors of 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{16106}
\]
