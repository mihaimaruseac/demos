To solve the problem, we need to understand how numbers are placed on the spiral and then find the number 2026 to determine its neighbors.

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Pattern

The spiral starts at 1 and expands outward in layers. Each layer is a square around the previous layer. The side length of the square containing number \( n \) is determined by the smallest odd number \( s \) such that:

\[
s^2 \geq n
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Layer of 2026

First, find the smallest odd \( s \) such that \( s^2 \geq 2026 \).

- \( 45^2 = 2025 \)
- \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

Thus, 2026 is on the layer where \( s = 47 \).

### Step 3: Find the Position of 2026

The bottom-right corner of the \( 47 \times 47 \) square is \( 47^2 = 2209 \). The numbers decrease counterclockwise from here:

- Bottom side: from 2209 to 2143 (47 numbers)
- Left side: from 2142 to 2108 (45 numbers)
- Top side: from 2107 to 2063 (45 numbers)
- Right side: from 2062 to 2026 (37 numbers)

2026 is on the right side, 37 numbers from the top-right corner (2062).

### Step 4: Calculate the Coordinates of 2026

The center of the spiral is at (0, 0), and the numbers increase as we move outward. The coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the \( 47 \times 47 \) square are (23, -23).

- Moving up along the right side:
  - Start at (23, -23)
  - Move up 36 steps to reach 2026

Coordinates of 2026:
\[
(23, -23 + 36) = (23, 13)
\]

### Step 5: Find the Neighbors of 2026

The neighbors of a point (x, y) are:
- (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)
- (x+1, y+1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1)

For (23, 13), the neighbors are:
- (24, 13), (22, 13), (23, 14), (23, 12)
- (24, 14), (22, 12), (24, 12), (22, 14)

### Step 6: Determine the Numbers at These Coordinates

Each layer \( s \) has a side length \( s \), and the top-right corner of the \( s \times s \) square is \( s^2 \).

For \( s = 47 \), the coordinates and corresponding numbers are:
- Top-right corner: \( (23, -23) \) is 2209
- Move left along top: \( (23, -22) \) is 2208, ..., \( (22, -23) \) is 2143
- Move down left: \( (21, -23) \) is 2139, ..., \( (-22, -23) \) is 1937
- Move up right: \( (-22, -22) \) is 1936, ..., \( (23, 23) \) is 9
- Move right down: \( (23, 22) \) is 10, ..., \( (23, 23) \) is 2026

Using these, calculate the numbers at the neighbor coordinates:
- (24, 13): 2030
- (22, 13): 2032
- (23, 14): 2025
- (23, 12): 2027
- (24, 14): 2024
- (22, 12): 2028
- (24, 12): 2026 (itself)
- (22, 14): 2023

### Step 7: Sum the Neighbors

Sum the numbers at the neighbor coordinates:
\[
2030 + 2032 + 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 = 16129
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is:

\[
\boxed{16129}
\]
