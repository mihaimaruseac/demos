To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and determine the position of the number 2026 within it. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and expands outward in a clockwise direction.

### Step 1: Determine the layer of the spiral

The numbers in the spiral are arranged in concentric squares. The center is layer 0 with just the number 1. The first layer around it (forming a 3x3 square) contains numbers from 2 to 9, the second layer (forming a 5x5 square) contains numbers from 10 to 25, and so on.

The \( n \)-th layer forms a \((2n+1) \times (2n+1)\) square. The largest number in the \( n \)-th layer is \((2n+1)^2\).

To find the layer containing 2026, we solve:
\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011
\]
Thus:
\[
2n+1 \geq 46 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2n \geq 45 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \geq 22.5
\]
So, \( n = 23 \).

### Step 2: Determine the position of 2026 in layer 23

The largest number in layer 22 is \( 45^2 = 2025 \). Therefore, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

The numbers in layer 23 form a \( 47 \times 47 \) square, with side lengths of 47. The numbers increase as you move around this square in a clockwise direction.

- **Bottom-right corner**: \( 47^2 = 2209 \)
- **Bottom edge**: From \( 2026 \) to \( 2026 + 46 = 2072 \)
- **Left edge**: From \( 2072 \) to \( 2072 + 46 = 2118 \)
- **Top edge**: From \( 2118 \) to \( 2118 + 46 = 2164 \)
- **Right edge**: From \( 2164 \) back to \( 2209 \)

Position of 2026: Bottom-right corner of the bottom edge.

### Step 3: Find the 8 neighbors of 2026

The neighbors of a number in the spiral are directly adjacent vertically and horizontally, except for corners and edges where some neighbors are outside the grid.

For 2026, located at the bottom-right corner of the bottom edge:
- Directly above: 2025
- Left: 2071
- Top-left: 2117
- Top: 2163
- Top-right: 2208
- Right: 2027
- Bottom: \( 2026 + 47 = 2073 \)
- Bottom-left: 2072

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the neighbors

The neighbors are: 2025, 2071, 2117, 2163, 2208, 2027, 2073, and 2072.

Calculating the sum:
\[
2025 + 2071 + 2117 + 2163 + 2208 + 2027 + 2073 + 2072 = 16756
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16756}\).
