To solve the problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral and then find the sum of its 8 neighbors.

### Step 1: Determine the Layer of 2026

The spiral is structured such that each layer \( n \) forms a square with side length \( 2n + 1 \). The numbers in the spiral are arranged as follows:

- The 1st layer (around 1) is a 1x1 square.
- The 2nd layer (around 1 to 9) is a 3x3 square.
- The 3rd layer (around 1 to 25) is a 5x5 square.
- The \( n \)-th layer is a \( (2n+1) \times (2n+1) \) square.

The largest number in the \( n \)-th layer is \( (2n+1)^2 \).

We need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

Calculating:

- \( (2n-1)^2 < 2026 \) implies \( 2n-1 < \sqrt{2026} \).
- \( (2n+1)^2 \geq 2026 \) implies \( 2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \).

Approximating \( \sqrt{2026} \):

\[
\sqrt{2025} = 45 \quad \text{(since \( 45^2 = 2025 \))}
\]

Thus, \( 44 < 2n+1 \leq 45 \).

Solving these inequalities:

- \( 2n+1 \geq 45 \) gives \( 2n \geq 44 \) or \( n \geq 22 \).
- \( 2n-1 < 45 \) gives \( 2n < 46 \) or \( n < 23 \).

Thus, \( n = 22 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Position of 2026

For \( n = 22 \), the side length is \( 2 \times 22 + 1 = 45 \).

- The largest number in the 21st layer is \( 43^2 = 1849 \).
- The largest number in the 22nd layer is \( 45^2 = 2025 \).

Since \( 2026 \) is the first number in the 23rd layer, it is just after 2025.

The numbers in the 22nd layer form a square around the numbers in the 21st layer. The bottom-right corner of the 22nd layer is 2025.

The bottom-right corner of a \( 45 \times 45 \) square is at position \( (45, 45) \).

### Step 3: Position of 2026

Since 2026 is the first number in the next layer, it is at the top-right corner of the \( 47 \times 47 \) square:

- Position of 2026: \( (46, 1) \)

### Step 4: Calculate the Neighbors

The neighbors of 2026 at position \( (46, 1) \) are:

- Left: \( (46, 0) \) — 2021 (bottom-right of layer 22)
- Right: \( (46, 2) \) — 2031 (2 steps right from 2026)
- Top: \( (45, 1) \) — 2025 (just below 2026)
- Bottom: \( (47, 1) \) — 2047 (1 step down from 2026)
- Top-left: \( (45, 0) \) — 2016 (bottom-left of layer 22)
- Top-right: \( (45, 2) \) — 2030
- Bottom-left: \( (47, 0) \) — 2046
- Bottom-right: \( (47, 2) \) — 2056

### Step 5: Sum the Neighbors

Sum of the neighbors:

\[
2021 + 2031 + 2025 + 2047 + 2016 + 2030 + 2046 + 2056 = 16272
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16272}\).
