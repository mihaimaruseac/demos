To solve this problem, we need to find the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then identify its 8 neighbors. The spiral starts with 1 at the center and expands outward in a square spiral pattern.

### Step 1: Determine the layer where 2026 is located.

The numbers on the spiral are arranged in concentric layers. The first layer contains just the number 1. The second layer contains numbers from 2 to 9, forming a 3x3 grid, and so on. 

The \(n\)-th layer forms a \((2n-1) \times (2n-1)\) grid. The bottom-right corner of the \(n\)-th layer is \((2n-1)^2\).

We need to find \(n\) such that:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

Calculate \((2n-1)^2\) and \((2n+1)^2\) for successive \(n\):

- For \(n = 1\), \((2 \times 1 - 1)^2 = 1\)
- For \(n = 2\), \((2 \times 2 - 1)^2 = 9\)
- For \(n = 3\), \((2 \times 3 - 1)^2 = 25\)
- For \(n = 4\), \((2 \times 4 - 1)^2 = 49\)
- For \(n = 5\), \((2 \times 5 - 1)^2 = 81\)
- For \(n = 6\), \((2 \times 6 - 1)^2 = 121\)
- For \(n = 7\), \((2 \times 7 - 1)^2 = 169\)
- For \(n = 8\), \((2 \times 8 - 1)^2 = 225\)
- For \(n = 9\), \((2 \times 9 - 1)^2 = 289\)
- For \(n = 10\), \((2 \times 10 - 1)^2 = 361\)
- For \(n = 11\), \((2 \times 11 - 1)^2 = 441\)
- For \(n = 12\), \((2 \times 12 - 1)^2 = 529\)
- For \(n = 13\), \((2 \times 13 - 1)^2 = 625\)
- For \(n = 14\), \((2 \times 14 - 1)^2 = 729\)
- For \(n = 15\), \((2 \times 15 - 1)^2 = 841\)
- For \(n = 16\), \((2 \times 16 - 1)^2 = 961\)
- For \(n = 17\), \((2 \times 17 - 1)^2 = 1089\)
- For \(n = 18\), \((2 \times 18 - 1)^2 = 1225\)
- For \(n = 19\), \((2 \times 19 - 1)^2 = 1369\)
- For \(n = 20\), \((2 \times 20 - 1)^2 = 1521\)
- For \(n = 21\), \((2 \times 21 - 1)^2 = 1681\)
- For \(n = 22\), \((2 \times 22 - 1)^2 = 1849\)
- For \(n = 23\), \((2 \times 23 - 1)^2 = 2025\)
- For \(n = 24\), \((2 \times 24 - 1)^2 = 2209\)

We find that \(2025 < 2026 \leq 2209\), so 2026 is in the 24th layer.

### Step 2: Determine the position of 2026 within the 24th layer.

The bottom-right corner of the 23rd layer is 2025. The side length of the 24th layer is \(2 \times 24 - 1 = 47\).

The numbers on the 24th layer start from 2026 and go up to 2209. The numbers are arranged as follows:

- Bottom side (right to left): starts at 2026, goes to 2072.
- Left side (top to bottom): starts at 2073, goes to 2120.
- Top side (left to right): starts at 2121, goes to 2168.
- Right side (bottom to top): starts at 2169, goes to 2209.

Find where 2026 is located:
- 2026 is the first number on the bottom side.

### Step 3: Determine the neighbors of 2026.

The position of 2026 is at the bottom-right corner of the 24th layer. Its neighbors are:

- Directly above: 2072 (bottom side, one position to the left)
- Diagonally above-left: 2120 (left side, at the top)
- Diagonally above-right: 2169 (right side, at the bottom)
- Directly left: 2073 (left side, at the top)
- Directly right: 2025 (23rd layer, bottom-right corner)
- Diagonally below-left: 1681 (23rd layer, bottom-left corner)
- Diagonally below-right: 2024 (23rd layer, right side, one position above the bottom-right corner)
- Directly below: 2168 (top side, one position to the left)

Calculate the sum of these neighbors:
\[
2072 + 2120 + 2169 + 2073 + 2025 + 1681 + 2024 + 2168
\]

Perform the addition:
\[
2072 + 2120 = 4192
\]
\[
4192 + 2169 = 6361
\]
\[
6361 + 2073 = 8434
\]
\[
8434 + 2025 = 10459
\]
\[
10459 + 1681 = 12140
\]
\[
12140 + 2024 = 14164
\]
\[
14164 + 2168 = 16332
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16332}\).
