To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral and then find the sum of its 8 neighbors.

The spiral starts with 1 at the center and expands outward in a square grid. The numbers are arranged in concentric layers or "rings" around the center. Let's determine the layer in which the number 2026 is located.

1. **Identify the Layer:**
   - The center (1) is layer 0.
   - The first layer (3x3 grid) contains numbers from 2 to 9.
   - The second layer (5x5 grid) contains numbers from 10 to 25.
   - The third layer (7x7 grid) contains numbers from 26 to 49.
   - Generally, the \( n \)-th layer forms a \((2n+1) \times (2n+1)\) grid.

   The largest number in the \( n \)-th layer is \((2n+1)^2\).

2. **Find the Layer for 2026:**
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \((2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2\).

   Calculate:
   - \((2n-1)^2 < 2026\) implies \(2n-1 < \sqrt{2026}\).
   - \((2n+1)^2 \geq 2026\) implies \(2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026}\).

   Calculate \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011\).

   - \(2n-1 < 45.011\) gives \(2n < 46.011\) and \(n < 23.0055\).
   - \(2n+1 \geq 45.011\) gives \(2n \geq 44.011\) and \(n \geq 22.0055\).

   Thus, \(n = 23\).

3. **Determine the Position in Layer 23:**
   - The largest number in layer 22 is \( (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 41^2 = 1681 \).
   - The largest number in layer 23 is \( (2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \).

   Therefore, 2026 is in layer 23, and its position is \(2026 - 1681 = 345\) into layer 23.

4. **Find the Starting Position of Layer 23:**
   - The first number in layer 23 is 1682, which is at the bottom-left corner of the 47x47 square.
   - The bottom side of this square has numbers from 1682 to 1731 (47 numbers).
   - The right side has numbers from 1732 to 1780.
   - The top side has numbers from 1781 to 1827.
   - The left side has numbers from 1828 to 1876.

5. **Locate 2026:**
   - 2026 is the 345th number in layer 23.
   - It is on the top side: \(345 - 46 = 299\) into the top side.
   - Starting at 1781, 2026 is at position 299, which is \(1781 + 298 = 2079\).

   Therefore, 2026 is actually on the left side:
   - It is \(2026 - 1828 = 198\) into the left side, starting at 1828.
   - Position: \(1828 + 197 = 2025\).

   Correcting, 2026 is at position 198 on the left side.

6. **Neighbors of 2026:**
   - The position of 2026 is 198 on the left side.
   - Neighbors:
     - Above: 1926 (left side, 198 - 46 = 152)
     - Below: 2072 (left side, 198 + 46 = 244)
     - Left: 2025 (left side, 197)
     - Right: 2027 (left side, 199)
     - Top-left: 1870 (top side, 198 - 58 = 140)
     - Top-right: 1872 (top side, 140 + 2 = 142)
     - Bottom-left: 1950 (bottom side, 244 - 94 = 150)
     - Bottom-right: 1952 (bottom side, 150 + 2 = 152)

7. **Sum of Neighbors:**
   \[
   1926 + 2072 + 2025 + 2027 + 1870 + 1872 + 1950 + 1952 = 15794
   \]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{15794}\).
