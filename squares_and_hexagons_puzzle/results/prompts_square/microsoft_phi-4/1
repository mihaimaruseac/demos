To solve this problem, we need to understand how numbers are arranged in the spiral and identify the position of the number 2026. Once we find its position, we can determine its 8 neighbors and calculate their sum.

### Step 1: Determine the layer of the spiral containing 2026

The spiral is structured in layers around the center. The center layer (layer 0) contains only the number 1. Each subsequent layer \( n \) forms a square with side length \( 2n + 1 \).

- **Layer 0**: Contains number 1.
- **Layer 1**: Contains numbers from 2 to 9 (3x3 square).
- **Layer 2**: Contains numbers from 10 to 25 (5x5 square).
- **Layer 3**: Contains numbers from 26 to 49 (7x7 square).
- Continue this pattern...

The number of elements in layer \( n \) is the total number of elements up to that layer minus the total number of elements up to the previous layer:

\[
\text{Elements in layer } n = (2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = 8n
\]

The cumulative number of elements up to layer \( n \) is:

\[
1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 8k = 1 + 4n(n+1)
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
1 + 4n(n+1) \geq 2026
\]

Simplifying:

\[
4n(n+1) \geq 2025
\]

\[
n(n+1) \geq 506.25
\]

Testing values of \( n \):

- \( n = 22 \): \( 22 \times 23 = 506 \)
- \( n = 23 \): \( 23 \times 24 = 552 \)

Thus, 2026 is in layer 23.

### Step 2: Determine the position of 2026 within layer 23

The first number in layer 23 is:

\[
1 + 4 \times 22 \times 23 = 2025
\]

The side length of layer 23 is \( 2 \times 23 + 1 = 47 \).

The numbers in layer 23 range from 2025 to \( 47^2 = 2209 \).

#### Calculate the position along the side:

- **Bottom side (right to left):** Numbers from 2025 to 2071
- **Left side (top to bottom):** Numbers from 2072 to 2122
- **Top side (left to right):** Numbers from 2123 to 2171
- **Right side (bottom to top):** Numbers from 2172 to 2209

2026 is on the bottom side:

- Position on the bottom side: \( 2026 - 2025 = 1 \)
- Full side length: 47

Thus, 2026 is 1 position from the bottom-left corner (2025).

### Step 3: Determine the coordinates of 2026

The center of the spiral (1) is at \((0, 0)\).

- **Bottom side (right to left):** Moves from \((11, -23)\) to \((-11, -23)\)
- 2026 is the 2nd position from \((11, -23)\), so its coordinates are \((10, -23)\).

### Step 4: Find the 8 neighbors of 2026

The neighbors are:

- \((11, -23)\) (one step right)
- \((9, -23)\) (one step left)
- \((10, -22)\) (one step up)
- \((10, -24)\) (one step down)
- \((11, -22)\) (diagonal up-right)
- \((9, -22)\) (diagonal up-left)
- \((11, -24)\) (diagonal down-right)
- \((9, -24)\) (diagonal down-left)

### Step 5: Calculate the numbers at these positions

- **Right (11, -23):** 2025
- **Left (9, -23):** 2027
- **Up (10, -22):** 2019
- **Down (10, -24):** 2033
- **Diagonal up-right (11, -22):** 2018
- **Diagonal up-left (9, -22):** 2028
- **Diagonal down-right (11, -24):** 2034
- **Diagonal down-left (9, -24):** 2026 (center itself, incorrect for neighbor)

Correct the diagonal down-left to \((10, -23)\) which is 2026 itself, so replace with correct diagonal:

- **Diagonal down-left (10, -23):** 2032

### Step 6: Sum the neighbors

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2019 + 2033 + 2018 + 2028 + 2034 + 2032 = 16216
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16216}\).
