To solve this problem, we first need to determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral and then find the sum of its 8 neighbors. The spiral is constructed such that the numbers increase in a square spiral pattern starting from 1 at the center.

### Step 1: Determine the Layer of 2026

The spiral is structured in layers, where each layer \( n \) forms a square. The side length of the square for layer \( n \) is \( 2n + 1 \). The bottom-right corner of each layer \( n \) is the largest number in that layer, which is \( (2n+1)^2 \).

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

Calculating:
- \( (2n-1)^2 < 2026 \) implies \( 2n-1 < \sqrt{2026} \).
- \( (2n+1)^2 \geq 2026 \) implies \( 2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \).

First, approximate \( \sqrt{2026} \):
\[
\sqrt{2025} = 45 \quad \text{(since \( 45^2 = 2025 \))}
\]
Thus, \( 45 < \sqrt{2026} < 46 \).

Now, solve the inequalities:
- \( 2n-1 < 45 \) gives \( 2n < 46 \) or \( n < 23 \).
- \( 2n+1 \geq 46 \) gives \( 2n \geq 45 \) or \( n \geq 22.5 \).

Thus, \( n = 23 \).

### Step 2: Find the Position of 2026

The bottom-right corner of layer 23 is:
\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

The bottom-right corner of layer 22 is:
\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

Since \( 2025 < 2026 \leq 2209 \), 2026 is in layer 23. The numbers in layer 23 start from 2026 and go up to 2209.

The positions in layer 23 are:
- Bottom-right corner: 2209
- Bottom edge (left to right): 2026 to 2209
- Left edge (bottom to top): 2208 to 2071
- Top edge (right to left): 2070 to 2049
- Right edge (top to bottom): 2048 to 2071

To find the exact position of 2026:
- It is the first number on the bottom edge of layer 23.

### Step 3: Calculate the Position and Neighbors

The center of the spiral is at position (0, 0). The side length of layer 23 is 47, so the center of layer 23 is at position (11, -11) (since it starts at -11 and goes to +11).

The bottom-right corner of layer 23 (2209) is at (11, 11). The bottom-left corner is at (-11, 11).

Since 2026 is the first number on the bottom edge, its position is:
\[
(-11, 11 - (2209 - 2026)) = (-11, 11 - 183) = (-11, -172)
\]

### Step 4: Find the Neighbors

The neighbors of (-11, -172) are:
- (-11, -171), (-10, -171), (-10, -172), (-10, -173)
- (-11, -173), (-12, -171), (-12, -172), (-12, -173)

Calculate the numbers at these positions:
- (-11, -171) is 2025 (left of 2026)
- (-10, -171) is 2030 (top-right of 2029)
- (-10, -172) is 2029 (right of 2028)
- (-10, -173) is 2028 (top of 2027)
- (-11, -173) is 2027 (left of 2028)
- (-12, -171) is 2046 (bottom-right of 2045)
- (-12, -172) is 2045 (bottom of 2044)
- (-12, -173) is 2044 (bottom-left of 2043)

Sum of neighbors:
\[
2025 + 2030 + 2029 + 2028 + 2027 + 2046 + 2045 + 2044 = 16274
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is \(\boxed{16274}\).
