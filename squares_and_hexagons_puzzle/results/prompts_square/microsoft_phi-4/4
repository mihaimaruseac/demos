To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how numbers are arranged in it. The spiral starts at 1 and expands outward in a counter-clockwise direction. The numbers are arranged in concentric square layers.

### Step 1: Determine the Layer of 2026

Each layer \( n \) of the spiral corresponds to an odd square number. The side length of the square for layer \( n \) is \( 2n - 1 \), and the numbers in the layer range from \((2n-3)^2 + 1\) to \((2n-1)^2\).

To find which layer contains 2026, we need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
(2n-3)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n-1)^2
\]

Calculate the largest \( n \) for which \((2n-1)^2 \geq 2026\):

\[
(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026 \implies 2n-1 \geq \sqrt{2026}
\]

Calculate \(\sqrt{2026}\):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011
\]

Thus, \(2n-1 \geq 46\), leading to \(2n \geq 47\) and \(n \geq 23.5\). Therefore, \(n = 24\).

Check the bounds for \(n = 24\):

- \((2 \times 24 - 3)^2 = 45^2 = 2025\)
- \((2 \times 24 - 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209\)

Thus, 2026 is in layer 24, between 2026 and 2209.

### Step 2: Determine the Position of 2026

The bottom-right corner of layer 24 is 2209. The positions in layer 24 are:

- Bottom (left to right): 2025 to 2209
- Left (top to bottom): 2208 to 1985
- Top (right to left): 1984 to 2009
- Right (bottom to top): 2008 to 2026

Since 2026 is the first number on the right side going upwards, it is at the start of this side.

### Step 3: Find the Neighbors of 2026

The position of 2026 is at the start of the upward movement on the right side. The neighbors are:

- Top: 2025
- Top-right: 2024
- Right: 2027
- Bottom-right: 2028
- Bottom: 2031
- Bottom-left: 2032
- Left: 2033
- Top-left: 2034

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of the Neighbors

Now, sum these numbers:

\[
2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 + 2034
\]

Calculate the sum:

\[
2025 + 2024 = 4049
\]
\[
4049 + 2027 = 6076
\]
\[
6076 + 2028 = 8104
\]
\[
8104 + 2031 = 10135
\]
\[
10135 + 2032 = 12167
\]
\[
12167 + 2033 = 14200
\]
\[
14200 + 2034 = 16234
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16234}\).
