To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then find the sum of its 8 neighboring numbers.

The spiral is constructed by starting at 1 and moving in a counter-clockwise spiral:

```
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23  24  25
```

The numbers are arranged in concentric layers around the center. The center, 1, is at layer 0. The first layer around it (3x3) contains numbers 2 to 9, the second layer (5x5) contains numbers 10 to 25, and so on.

### Step 1: Determine the layer of 2026

The \( n \)-th layer contains numbers from \((2n-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2n+1)^2\). The side length of the \( n \)-th layer is \( 2n+1 \).

To find the layer containing 2026, solve:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

Calculate:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \implies 2n-1 < \sqrt{2026} \implies 2n-1 < 45.011 \implies 2n < 46.011 \implies n < 23.0055
\]
\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026 \implies 2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \implies 2n+1 \geq 45.011 \implies 2n \geq 44.011 \implies n \geq 22.0055
\]

Thus, \( n = 23 \).

### Step 2: Determine the position of 2026 in layer 23

The first number in layer 23 is:
\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026
\]

The last number in layer 23 is:
\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

The side length of layer 23 is 47. The numbers are arranged as follows:
- Top side: from 2026 to 2072 (47 numbers)
- Right side: from 2073 to 2120
- Bottom side: from 2121 to 2167
- Left side: from 2168 to 2209

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it is at the top-left corner of the layer.

### Step 3: Find the neighbors of 2026

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- Directly below: 2027
- Below and to the right: 2044
- Directly to the right: 2043
- Above and to the right: 2003
- Directly above: 2015
- Above and to the left: 1924
- Directly to the left: 1925
- Below and to the left: 2036

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the neighbors

Sum the neighbors:
\[
2027 + 2044 + 2043 + 2003 + 2015 + 1924 + 1925 + 2036
\]

Calculate:
\[
2027 + 2044 = 4071
\]
\[
4071 + 2043 = 6114
\]
\[
6114 + 2003 = 8117
\]
\[
8117 + 2015 = 10132
\]
\[
10132 + 1924 = 12056
\]
\[
12056 + 1925 = 13981
\]
\[
13981 + 2036 = 16017
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16017}\).
