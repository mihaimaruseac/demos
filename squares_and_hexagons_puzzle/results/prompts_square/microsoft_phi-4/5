To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then find the sum of its 8 neighboring numbers.

The spiral grid is constructed as follows:
- The center of the spiral is 1.
- The numbers increase as they move outward in a clockwise spiral pattern.

The numbers on the spiral form concentric squares:
- The first layer (center) contains just the number 1.
- The second layer contains numbers from 2 to 9.
- The third layer contains numbers from 10 to 25.
- The fourth layer contains numbers from 26 to 49.
- Generally, the \( n \)-th layer contains numbers from \((2n-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2n+1)^2\).

To find which layer contains 2026, we need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

Calculating the bounds:
- \((2n-1)^2 < 2026\) implies \(2n-1 < \sqrt{2026}\).
- \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011\), so \(2n-1 < 45.011\).
- Thus, \(2n < 46.011\) and \(n < 23.0055\).

- \((2n+1)^2 \geq 2026\) implies \(2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026}\).
- Thus, \(2n+1 \geq 45.011\) and \(2n \geq 44.011\).
- Therefore, \(n \geq 22.0055\).

Since \(n\) must be an integer, \(n = 23\).

Now, calculate the range of numbers in the 23rd layer:
- The smallest number is \((2 \times 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026\).
- The largest number is \((2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209\).

Thus, 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer.

The numbers in the 23rd layer form a square with side length 47. The positions of the numbers in this layer are:
- Bottom-right to bottom-left on the last row.
- Bottom-left to top-left on the last column.
- Top-left to top-right on the top row.
- Top-right to bottom-right on the first column.

Since 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, it is located at the bottom-right corner of the 47x47 square.

The coordinates of 2026 are \((23, -23)\) (since it's 23 steps right and 23 steps down from the center \((0, 0)\)).

The neighbors of a point \((x, y)\) are:
\[
(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y+1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1)
\]

Calculating the positions of the neighbors:
- \((24, -23)\)
- \((22, -23)\)
- \((23, -22)\)
- \((23, -24)\)
- \((24, -22)\)
- \((22, -24)\)
- \((24, -24)\)
- \((22, -22)\)

Now, determine the numbers at these positions:
- \((24, -23)\) is the last number in the bottom row: 2209.
- \((22, -23)\) is the first number in the bottom row of the 22nd layer: 1936.
- \((23, -22)\) is the last number in the left column: 2116.
- \((23, -24)\) is the first number in the left column of the 22nd layer: 1849.
- \((24, -22)\) is 2208.
- \((22, -24)\) is 1848.
- \((24, -24)\) is 2100.
- \((22, -22)\) is 2025.

Sum of the neighbors:
\[
2209 + 1936 + 2116 + 1849 + 2208 + 1848 + 2100 + 2025 = 16291
\]

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \(\boxed{16291}\).
