To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral grid of natural numbers, we need to determine the positions of the numbers in the spiral and identify the neighbors of 2026. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward in a clockwise manner, as suggested by the given pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Structure
The spiral is constructed on a square grid, starting at the center with 1, then moving right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, and so on, expanding outward in layers (or "rings"). Each ring corresponds to a square layer around the center.

- Ring 0: Just the center (1).
- Ring 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (a 3x3 grid).
- Ring 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (a 5x5 grid).
- Ring 3: Numbers 26 to 49 (a 7x7 grid).
- And so on.

For a ring \( k \), the side length of the square grid is \( 2k + 1 \), and the numbers in that ring range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 \) to \( (2k+1)^2 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Ring of 2026
We need to find which ring contains the number 2026. The largest number in ring \( k \) is \( (2k+1)^2 \). So, we solve for \( k \) such that:
\[
(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2k+1)^2
\]
- Compute the square root of 2026: \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 44.99 \), so the side length of the grid is around 45 (since \( 45^2 = 2025 \), close to 2026).
- For ring \( k \), the largest number is \( (2k+1)^2 \):
  - If \( 2k+1 = 45 \), then \( k = 22 \), and the largest number in ring 22 is \( 45^2 = 2025 \).
  - Since 2026 > 2025, 2026 is in ring 23, where the largest number is \( (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \).

Confirm the range for ring 23:
- Smallest number in ring 23: \( (2*22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026 \).
- Largest number in ring 23: \( 47^2 = 2209 \).

Thus, 2026 is the first number in ring 23, meaning it is at the bottom-left corner of the 47x47 grid (since the spiral starts a new ring by moving left from the bottom-left corner after completing the previous ring).

### Step 3: Assign Coordinates
Place the center (number 1) at coordinates (0,0). For ring \( k \), the coordinates range from \( -k \) to \( k \) in both x and y directions.
- Ring 1 (3x3 grid): coordinates from -1 to 1.
- Ring 2 (5x5 grid): coordinates from -2 to 2.
- Ring 23 (47x47 grid): coordinates from -23 to 23.

For ring 23:
- Bottom-left corner: (-23, -23), which should be the starting point of ring 23, number 2026.
- The spiral in ring 23 moves left along y = -23 from x = -23 to x = 23 (numbers 2026 to 2068), then up along x = 23, then right along y = 23, then down along x = -23.

In standard spiral construction (as per the problem's example), after reaching the bottom-left of the previous ring, the next ring starts by moving left. However, adjusting to the problem's pattern (1 at center, 2 right, 3 up, etc.), let's trace:
- Ring 22 ends at (22, -22) with number 2025 (since \( 45^2 = 2025 \)).
- Ring 23 starts by moving left to (-23, -22), but we need to match 2026 at the start.

Let's compute positions:
- Number 2025 (end of ring 22) is at (22, -22).
- Ring 23 starts by moving left to (-23, -22), but since 2026 is the start, and side length is 47, let's confirm positions.

I am considering a general formula for the position of a number in the spiral.

### Step 4: Position of 2026
Since 2026 is the first number of ring 23, and ring 22 ends at 2025, in a standard Ulam spiral adjusted to the problem's pattern:
- Ring 22 ends at bottom-right or similar, but from earlier, largest number in ring \( k \) is at bottom-right or adjusted.
- For ring 23, starting number 2026 is at (-23, -23) if we follow a consistent pattern.

Testing smaller rings:
- Ring 1: 9 at (1, -1).
- Ring 2: 25 at (2, -2).
- So, ring \( k \) ends at (k, -k), and ring \( k+1 \) starts at (-(k+1), -k) or similar.

For ring 23:
- Ring 22 ends at (22, -22) with 2025.
- Ring 23 starts by moving left to (-23, -22), but numbers don't match, so let's compute properly.

Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, and 2025 is at (22, -22), the spiral likely moves left to x = -23 at y = -22, but let's find exact:
- Total numbers up to ring 22: 2025.
- Ring 23 starts at 2026, and since side length increases, position should be (-23, -22) or similar.

I am considering the spiral direction:
- After (22, -22), next move is left if ring 23 starts leftward, but in standard spiral, after bottom-right, it moves left along bottom.

Assuming ring 23 starts at bottom-left (-23, -23):
- Numbers 2026 to 2068 (23*2 + 22*2 = 46 numbers) along y = -23 from x = -23 to x = 22.
- But total in ring 23: 2026 to 2209 = 184 numbers, and side length 47, so corners adjust.

Standard spiral for ring k:
- Start at bottom-left (-k, -k), move right to (k, -k).
- Then up to (k, k).
- Then left to (-k, k).
- Then down to (-k, -k+1) or adjust.

For simplicity, since 2026 is the start of ring 23, it is at (-23, -23).

### Step 5: Neighbors of 2026
If 2026 is at (-23, -23), its 8 neighbors are at:
- (-24, -23)
- (-24, -22)
- (-24, -24)
- (-23, -22)
- (-23, -24)
- (-22, -23)
- (-22, -22)
- (-22, -24)

Since the grid for ring 23 is 47x47, coordinates range from -23 to 23, so (-24, anything) is outside the grid for ring 23, but numbers continue in ring 24.

I need to find numbers at these positions, but it's complex without a direct formula.

### Step 6: Alternative Approach - Approximate Position
Since exact position calculation is tedious, note that in large rings, neighbors are approximately consecutive numbers or follow a pattern.

For large k, in ring k, numbers along a side are roughly consecutive.

Since 2026 is at the start of ring 23, at bottom-left corner (-23, -23), let's deduce neighbors by spiral direction:
- Ring 23 starts at 2026 at (-23, -23), moves right to 2027 at (-22, -23), 2028 at (-21, -23), up to x=23, y=-23 at number 2026 + 46 = 2072.
- Then moves up along x=23.

Neighbors of (-23, -23):
- Right: (-22, -23) = 2027 (in ring 23).
- Up: (-23, -22) = likely in ring 22 or adjust.
- In spiral, before 2026 is 2025 at (22, -22), end of ring 22.

I can list positions near the corner.

Since it's a corner, some neighbors are in ring 22 and some in ring 23.

Ring 22 ends at (22, -22) = 2025, and ring 23 starts at (-23, -23) = 2026.

Possible neighbors:
- (-22, -23): should be 2027 (next in ring 23).
- (-23, -22): trace back, ring 22 has numbers along y=-22 from x=22 down to x=-22 or similar.

This is getting complex, so let's finalize positions.

### Step 7: Correct Position via Calculation
Total numbers up to ring 22: \( (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \).

Ring 23:
- Bottom side: from (-23, -23) to (23, -23): 47 numbers (2026 to 2072).
- Right side: from (23, -22) to (23, 23): 46 numbers (2073 to 2118).
- Top side: from (22, 23) to (-23, 23): 46 numbers (2119 to 2164).
- Left side: from (-23, 22) to (-23, -23): but adjust.

Standard spiral:
- Start ring 23 at (-23, -23)=2026.
- Move right to (23, -23)=2072.
- Move up to (23, 23)=2118.
- Move left to (-23, 23)=2164.
- Move down to (-23, -22)=2209, but total numbers 2209-2025=184, and 47*4-4=184, so:
  - Bottom: 47 numbers (x=-23 to 23, y=-23): 2026 to 2072.
  - Right: 46 numbers (y=-22 to 23, x=23): 2073 to 2118.
  - Top: 46 numbers (x=22 to -23, y=23): 2119 to 2164.
  - Left: 45 numbers (y=22 to -22, x=-23): 2165 to 2209.

So, at (-23, -23)=2026, neighbors are:
- (-22, -23)=2027 (right, in ring 23).
- (-23, -22)=2209 (down, last number of ring 23, since left side ends at y=-22).
- (-24, -23)= if outside, it's ring 24 start, but compute.

Ring 24 starts after 2209, at (-24, -24)=2210.

So neighbors of (-23, -23):
1. (-22, -23)=2027 (right).
2. (-23, -22)=2209 (up, last of ring 23).
3. (-24, -23)=2211 or compute ring 24.
Ring 24:
- Bottom: x=-24 to 24, y=-24: 49 numbers (2210 to 2258).
So (-24, -23) is not 2211, it's later, no:
- At x=-24, y=-24: 2210.
- Move right to x=24, y=-24: 2210 to 2258.
So (-24, -23) is not on bottom side, it's on left side later.

I made an error. Let's correct:
Ring 24 (side 49):
- Bottom: (-24,-24) to (24,-24): 49 numbers (2210 to 2258).
- Right: (24,-23) to (24,24): 48 numbers (2259 to 2306).
- So (-24,-23) is on left side, from (24,24) down.

Total numbers:
- Bottom: 49 (2210-2258)
- Right: 48 (2259-2306)
- Top: 48 (2307-2354)
- Left: 47 (2355-2401), since 49^2=2401.

Left side: x=-24, y=23 down to y=-24, but last is y=-23 or adjust.
- Left side from y=23 to y=-23 (since next ring starts at (-25,-25), but total 47 numbers.
49*4-4=192 numbers in ring 24 (2210 to 2401), yes.
Left side: x=-24, y=23 to y=-23 (47 numbers: 2355 to 2401).
So (-24,-23)=2401 (last number of ring 24).

This seems incorrect, let's count:
- Bottom: 49 (2210-2258)
- Right: 48 (2259-2306)
- Top: 48 (2307-2354)
- Left: must be 47 (2355-2401), and 2401=49^2, yes.
So (-24,-23)=2401.

Similarly:
- (-24,-24)=2210.
- (-24,-22)=2400 (second last on left side).
- (-23,-24)= in ring 23, bottom side doesn't have y=-24, no: ring 23 y from -23 to 23.
So (-23,-24) is in ring 24, bottom side, x=-23, y=-24=2211 (since (-24,-24)=2210, (-23,-24)=2211).

Neighbors of (-23,-23)=2026:
1. Right: (-22,-23)=2027
2. Up: (-23,-22)=2209
3. Left: (-24,-23)=2401
4. Down: (-23,-24)=2211
5. Up-right: (-22,-22)=? In ring 22, near 2025.
Ring 22 ends at (22,-22)=2025, so (-22,-22) is earlier in ring 22.
Ring 22:
- Starts after ring 21 (43^2=1849), so 1850 at (-22,-22).
- Moves right to (22,-22)=2025 (total 45 numbers on bottom, etc.).
Ring 22:
- Bottom: x=-22 to 22, y=-22: 45 numbers (1850 to 1894)
So (-22,-22)=1850.

6. Up-left: (-24,-22)=2400 (from ring 24 left side).
7. Down-right: (-22,-24)=2212 (ring 24 bottom side).
8. Down-left: (-24,-24)=2210.

### Step 8: Sum of Neighbors
Neighbors of 2026 at (-23,-23):
- (-22,-23)=2027
- (-23,-22)=2209
- (-24,-23)=2401
- (-23,-24)=2211
- (-22,-22)=1850
- (-24,-22)=2400
- (-22,-24)=2212
- (-24,-24)=2210

Sum = 2027 + 2209 + 2401 + 2211 + 1850 + 2400 + 2212 + 2210

Calculate:
- 2027 + 2209 = 4236
- 4236 + 2401 = 6637
- 6637 + 2211 = 8848
- 8848 + 1850 = 10698
- 10698 + 2400 = 13098
- 13098 + 2212 = 15310
- 15310 + 2210 = 17520

### Final Answer
The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17520**.
