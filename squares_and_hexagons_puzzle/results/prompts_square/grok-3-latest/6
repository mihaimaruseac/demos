To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral grid of natural numbers, we need to determine the positions of the numbers in the spiral and identify the neighbors surrounding 2026. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward in a clockwise manner, as suggested by the given pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Structure
The spiral begins at the center with 1, moves right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, and so on, forming layers or "rings" around the center. Each ring corresponds to a square of increasing size:
- Ring 0: Just the center (1).
- Ring 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (a 3x3 grid).
- Ring 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (a 5x5 grid).
- And so on.

For a number \( n \), we need to determine which ring it belongs to and its position within that ring to find its coordinates on the grid.

### Step 2: Determine the Ring of 2026
The numbers in each ring form a square pattern. The last number in ring \( k \) (where \( k = 0, 1, 2, ... \)) is \( (2k + 1)^2 \). For example:
- Ring 0: \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- Ring 1: \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- Ring 2: \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- Ring 3: \( 7^2 = 49 \)
- ...

We find the ring for 2026 by determining the smallest \( k \) such that \( (2k + 1)^2 \geq 2026 \):
- Compute \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 44.99 \), so try \( 2k + 1 \approx 45 \), meaning \( k \approx 22 \).
- Check \( k = 22 \): \( 2*22 + 1 = 45 \), \( 45^2 = 2025 \), which is less than 2026.
- Check \( k = 23 \): \( 2*23 + 1 = 47 \), \( 47^2 = 2209 \), which is greater than 2026.

Thus, 2026 is in ring 23, since it lies between \( 45^2 = 2025 \) (end of ring 22) and \( 47^2 = 2209 \) (end of ring 23).

### Step 3: Find the Position of 2026 in Ring 23
Each ring \( k \) starts at \( (2k - 1)^2 + 1 \) and ends at \( (2k + 1)^2 \). For ring 23:
- Start: \( (2*22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026 \)
- End: \( (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \)

Interestingly, 2026 is the first number in ring 23, since \( 45^2 = 2025 \), and \( 2025 + 1 = 2026 \).

In the spiral pattern, the first number of a new ring is placed to the right of the bottom-right corner of the previous ring. For ring 23:
- Ring 22 ends at 2025, which is at the bottom-right corner of the 45x45 grid.
- So, 2026 is placed one step to the right of 2025.

### Step 4: Assign Coordinates
Assume the center (number 1) is at coordinates (0, 0). Then:
- 2 is at (1, 0)
- 3 is at (1, 1)
- 4 is at (0, 1)
- 5 is at (-1, 1)
- 6 is at (-1, 0)
- 7 is at (-1, -1)
- 8 is at (0, -1)
- 9 is at (1, -1)

For ring \( k \), the bottom-right corner (end of ring \( k-1 \)) is at coordinates approximately \( (k, -k) \). For ring 22, ending at 2025, the coordinates are (22, -22), because:
- Each ring expands the grid by 2 in each direction.
- The bottom-right corner of ring \( k \) is at \( (k, -k) \).

Thus, 2025 (end of ring 22) is at (22, -22). Since 2026 is the start of ring 23, it is placed to the right of 2025, at (23, -22).

### Step 5: Identify the 8 Neighbors of 2026
The 8 neighbors of a cell at (x, y) are at positions:
- (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)
- (x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1)

For 2026 at (23, -22), the neighbors are at:
1. (24, -22)
2. (22, -22)
3. (23, -21)
4. (23, -23)
5. (24, -21)
6. (24, -23)
7. (22, -21)
8. (22, -23)

### Step 6: Determine the Numbers at These Positions
Since 2026 is at the start of ring 23, near the bottom-right area of the spiral, we can deduce the numbers around it based on the spiral pattern. Ring 23 starts at 2026 and proceeds right, then up, left, and down.

- Ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22, -22).
- Ring 23 starts at 2026 at (23, -22), then moves right:
  - 2027 at (24, -22)
  - Continues right up to the right edge, then up.

Let's assign numbers based on the spiral direction for ring 23:
- Starts at (23, -22) = 2026
- Moves right to (24, -22) = 2027
- Continues right up to x = 23 (since ring 23's right edge is at x=23 for the bottom row, but since it's a new ring, right edge is x=23+k, but let's compute neighbors directly.

Since 2026 is near the start of ring 23, and ring 22 occupies positions up to x=22 and y=-22, we note:
- (22, -22) = 2025 (end of ring 22)
- (23, -22) = 2026 (start of ring 23)
- (24, -22) = 2027 (next in ring 23)

Now, the spiral in ring 23 moves right along y=-22 until x=23 (but since it's a larger ring, right edge is x=23), but standard spiral for ring k, right edge is x=k.
I think I have a miscalculation in coordinates. Let me correct the coordinate system.

### Correction of Coordinates
In standard spiral numbering:
- Ring k has corners at (±k, ±k).
- For ring 1: ends at 9 at (1, -1)
- Ring 2: ends at 25 at (2, -2)
- So ring k ends at (k, -k)

Thus, ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22, -22)
Ring 23 starts at 2026 at (23, -22), moves right to (24, -22)=2027, but in standard spiral, ring 23's right edge should be x=23.

I realize the spiral's right edge for ring k is at x=k, so:
- Ring 1: right edge x=1 (2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1))
- Ring 2: right edge x=2 (numbers like 10 at (2, -1), etc.)
- So ring k: right edge x=k

Thus, ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22, -22)
Ring 23 starts at 2026 by moving right, but since x=22 is the edge for ring 22, ring 23's right edge should be x=23.

Standard spiral:
- After (k, -k), next number is (k+1, -k), but in ring k, max x is k.
I think I confused myself. Let's redefine.

Upon checking standard spiral (Ulam spiral style adjusted to match problem's snippet):
Given the problem's example (1 at center, 2 right, 3 up, etc.), coordinates:
- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)
- 10 at (2,-1)
- 11 at (2,0)
- 12 at (2,1)
- 13 at (2,2)
- etc.

So, ring k's bottom-right corner is at (k, -k), and next number (start of ring k+1) is at (k+1, -k)
- Ring 1 ends at 9 at (1,-1), ring 2 starts at 10 at (2,-1)
- Ring 2 ends at 25 at (2,-2), ring 3 starts at 26 at (3,-2)

Thus:
- Ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22, -22)
- Ring 23 starts at 2026 at (23, -22)

Now, ring 23 proceeds right along y=-22 up to x=23, but since ring 23's right edge is x=23:
In ring k, right side is x=k, so for ring 23, x=23 is the right edge.
- At y=-22, only x=23 is in ring 23, so 2026 at (23,-22)
- Then spiral moves up (since right edge reached), so 2027 at (23,-21)
- Continues up to y=22 (top edge), etc.

So neighbors of 2026 at (23,-22):
1. (24,-22): outside ring 23's right edge (x=23), so it's in ring 24, number after ring 23's end (2209), but let's compute.
Since spiral hasn't reached x=24 yet (ring 23's right edge is x=23), position (24,-22) is not yet filled in ring 23, it will be in ring 24.
I need numbers around.

Since 2026 is start of ring 23, neighbors inside ring 22 or ring 23:
- (22,-22)=2025 (ring 22 end)
- (23,-23): in ring 23, bottom edge starts after right and up, let's trace:
Ring 23:
- Starts (23,-22)=2026
- Moves up since x=23 is right edge: (23,-21)=2027
- Up to y=22: count numbers.
Numbers on right side x=23, y from -22 to 22: y=-22 to 22 is 45 numbers (2026 to 2070)
- So (23,-23) is not yet, after up to y=22, then left along y=22 to x=-23, then down.
Total in ring 23: from 2026 to 2209, total 2209-2025=184 numbers.
Right side x=23, y=-22 to 22: 45 numbers (2026 to 2070)
Top side y=22, x=22 to -23: 46 numbers (x=22 already in ring 22 at y=22, no: ring 22 max x=22, y=-22 to 22, but y=22 at x=22 is in ring 22 or not, standard is ring k max y=k-1 or k, I think I need exact.

Since it's complex, note positions around (23,-22):
- (22,-22)=2025 (ring 22)
- (23,-21)=2027 (ring 23, next number)
- (24,-22): not in ring 23, since x=23 is max for ring 23, so in ring 24, number after 2209, but let's find pattern.
In spiral, after ring 23 ends at (23,23) or similar, ring 24 starts at (24,23) or (24,-23), likely (24,-23)
Ring 23 ends at (23,-23) or similar, let's compute last number 2209:
Ring 23:
- Right: x=23, y=-22 to 22: 45 numbers (2026 to 2070)
- Top: y=22, x=22 to -23: x=22 is in ring 22, max x in ring 22 is 22, y=22 not in ring 22, ring 22 max y=21 or 22, check:
Ring 2 ends at (2,-2)=25, ring 1 max y=1, ring 2 y=2 at (2,2) not yet, standard spiral ring k max x=k, max y=k.
So ring 22: max x=22, max y=22, so at y=22, x=22 is in ring 22 or not, no:
Numbers in ring k: from (k,-k+1) etc., standard:
I can compute neighbors directly.

Since 2026 is at start, neighbors:
- Left (22,-22)=2025
- Up (23,-21)=2027
- Down (23,-23): since spiral goes up from 2026, down is not yet filled in ring 23, it's in ring 24 or later, but in spiral, after completing ring, next ring starts.
Ring 23 ends at 2209, likely at (-23,23) or similar, then ring 24 starts at (24,-23) or (23,-23)
Standard spiral: ring k ends at (k,-k), next starts at (k+1,-k)
Ring 1 ends (1,-1)=9, ring 2 starts (2,-1)=10
Ring 2 ends (2,-2)=25, ring 3 starts (3,-2)=26
So ring 22 ends (22,-22)=2025, ring 23 starts (23,-22)=2026
Ring 23 ends at (23,-23)=2209
Then ring 24 starts at (24,-23)=2210

So:
- (23,-23)=2209 (end of ring 23)
- (24,-23)=2210 (start of ring 24)
- (24,-22)=2211 (next in ring 24, moving up or right, likely up to (24,-22)=2211)

Ring 24:
- Starts (24,-23)=2210
- Moves up to y=23 since x=24 is right edge for ring 24
- So (24,-22)=2211

Similarly, (24,-21)=2212, etc.

Now neighbors of (23,-22):
1. (24,-22)=2211
2. (22,-22)=2025
3. (23,-21)=2027
4. (23,-23)=2209
5. (24,-21)=2212
6. (24,-23)=2210
7. (22,-21): in ring 22, since ring 22 covers x=22, y=-22 to 22 or so, yes, ring 22 includes y=-21 at x=22.
Ring 22 starts after ring 21 ends at (21,-21)=441^2=19881, no: (2*21+1)^2=43^2=1849
Ring 21 ends at 1849 at (21,-21)
Ring 22 starts at (22,-21)=1850
Moves up to y=21, so (22,-21)=1850, (22,-20)=1851, ..., (22,21)=1892 or so, then left, etc.
So (22,-21)=1850

8. (22,-23): ring 22 ends at (22,-22)=2025, before that bottom row y=-22, x=21 to 22 or so, ring 22 bottom y=-22, x=21 to 22:
Ring 22:
- After up side, top side y=22, x=21 to -22, etc., complex, but since ends at (22,-22)=2025, previous is (21,-22)=2024
So (22,-23) is not in ring 22, it's in ring 23 or later, no: ring 23 bottom is y=-23, but (22,-23):
Ring 23 ends at (23,-23)=2209, before that left side x=-23, y=-22 to 23 or so, compute:
Ring 23 total numbers=184
- Right x=23, y=-22 to 22: 45 numbers (2026-2070)
- Top y=22, x=22 to -23: 46 numbers (2071-2116)
- Left x=-23, y=22 to -22: 46 numbers (2117-2162)
- Bottom y=-23, x=-22 to 23: 47 numbers (2163-2209)
So bottom y=-23, x=-22 to 23, numbers 2163 to 2209, so x=23 is 2209, x=22 is 2208
Thus (22,-23)=2208

### Step 7: List All Neighbors
For 2026 at (23,-22), neighbors are:
1. (24,-22)=2211
2. (22,-22)=2025
3. (23,-21)=2027
4. (23,-23)=2209
5. (24,-21)=2212
6. (24,-23)=2210
7. (22,-21)=1850
8. (22,-23)=2208

### Step 8: Compute the Sum
Sum = 2211 + 2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 2212 + 2210 + 1850 + 2208

Calculate step by step:
- 2211 + 2025 = 4236
- 4236 + 2027 = 6263
- 6263 + 2209 = 8472
- 8472 + 2212 = 10684
- 10684 + 2210 = 12894
- 12894 + 1850 = 14744
- 14744 + 2208 = 16952

### Final Answer
The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16952**.
