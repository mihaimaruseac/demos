To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral grid of natural numbers, we need to determine the positions of the numbers in the spiral and identify the neighbors surrounding 2026. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward in a clockwise manner, typically following the pattern: right, up, left, down, with each segment increasing in length as the spiral grows.

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Structure
The spiral is laid out on a square grid with the number 1 at the center. The numbers are placed as follows:
- Start at 1.
- Move right to place 2.
- Move up to place 3.
- Move left to place 4 and 5.
- Move down to place 6 and 7.
- Move right to place 8, 9, 10, and so on, expanding outward.

The spiral forms layers (or rings) around the center. Each layer corresponds to a square of increasing size:
- Layer 0: just the center (1).
- Layer 1: numbers from 2 to 9 (a 3x3 square).
- Layer 2: numbers from 10 to 25 (a 5x5 square).
- Layer 3: numbers from 26 to 49 (a 7x7 square).
- And so on.

For a layer \( k \), the side length of the square is \( 2k + 1 \), and the numbers in that layer range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 \) to \( (2k+1)^2 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Layer of 2026
We need to find which layer contains the number 2026. The largest number in layer \( k \) is \( (2k+1)^2 \). So, we solve for \( k \) such that:
\[ (2k-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2k+1)^2 \]

Compute the square root of 2026 to estimate \( k \):
\[ \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \]
So, test around \( 2k+1 \approx 45 \), meaning \( k \approx 22 \).

- For \( k = 22 \):
  - Largest number in layer 22: \( (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \)
  - Since 2025 < 2026, 2026 is not in layer 22.
- For \( k = 23 \):
  - Largest number in layer 23: \( (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \)
  - Smallest number in layer 23: \( (2*22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026 \)

Since 2026 = 2026, the number 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Step 3: Locate 2026 in Layer 23
Layer 23 corresponds to a 47x47 square (since side length = \( 2*23 + 1 = 47 \)). The numbers in layer 23 range from 2026 to 2209. In a clockwise spiral:
- The layer starts at the bottom-right corner of the new layer.
- Moves right along the bottom side.
- Then up along the right side.
- Then left along the top side.
- Then down along the left side.

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it is located at the bottom-right corner of the 47x47 square.

Assign coordinates to the grid with the center (number 1) at (0,0):
- Layer 23’s bottom-right corner is at coordinates (23, -23), because:
  - x = 23 (rightmost edge of layer 23).
  - y = -23 (bottommost edge of layer 23).

Thus, 2026 is at position (23, -23).

### Step 4: Identify the 8 Neighbors of 2026
The 8 neighbors of a cell at (x, y) are the cells at:
- (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1) (orthogonal neighbors)
- (x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1) (diagonal neighbors)

For 2026 at (23, -23), the neighbor coordinates are:
1. (24, -23) — right
2. (22, -23) — left
3. (23, -22) — up
4. (23, -24) — down
5. (24, -22) — up-right
6. (24, -24) — down-right
7. (22, -22) — up-left
8. (22, -24) — down-left

### Step 5: Determine the Numbers at These Positions
We need to find the numbers at each of these coordinates. Since the spiral is structured by layers, we can determine the layer of each neighbor and compute the corresponding number.

#### Helper: Find Layer of a Position
For a position (x, y), the layer is determined by the maximum of the absolute values of x and y:
\[ \text{layer} = \max(|x|, |y|) \]

#### Helper: Find Number at Position (x, y)
For a given layer \( k = \max(|x|, |y|) \), the numbers in layer \( k \) range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 \) to \( (2k+1)^2 \). We trace the path of the spiral in layer \( k \):
- Starts at bottom-right: (k, -k)
- Moves right to (k, -k+1) ... (k, k)
- Moves up to (k-1, k) ... (-k, k)
- Moves left to (-k, k-1) ... (-k, -k)
- Moves down to (-k+1, -k) ... (k-1, -k)

Now, compute the number at each neighbor position.

1. **(24, -23)**: layer = max(24, 23) = 24
   - Layer 24 starts at (24, -24) with number \( 47^2 + 1 = 2210 \)
   - At (24, -23), it’s one step right from (24, -24), so number = 2211

2. **(22, -23)**: layer = max(22, 23) = 23
   - Layer 23 starts at (23, -23) with number 2026
   - Need to find position (22, -23) in layer 23
   - In layer 23, after moving right from (23, -23) to (23, 23), then up to (22, 23)
   - Total positions on bottom side: from y = -23 to 23, that’s 47 positions (2026 to 2072)
   - Then up on right side from (23, 22) down to (23, -23), but we’re at x=22, y=23 later
   - Actually, compute total numbers to reach x=22 on left side:
   - Bottom side: 47 numbers (2026 to 2072)
   - Right side: from (23, 22) to (23, -23), but up to (22, 23) after top
   - Total in layer 23: 2209 - 2025 = 184 numbers
   - Bottom side: y from -23 to 23 at x=23: 47 numbers
   - Right side: x from 23 to -23 at y=23: 46 numbers (2073 to 2118)
   - Top side: y from 23 to -23 at x=-23: 46 numbers (2119 to 2164)
   - Left side: x from -23 to 23 at y=-23: 45 numbers (2165 to 2209)
   - At x=22, y=-23: on left side, x from -23 to 22 is 45 - (23-22) = 44 steps from x=-23
   - Number at x=-23, y=-23 is 2165
   - So at x=22, y=-23: 2165 + (22 - (-23)) = 2165 + 45 = 2210, but adjust:
   - Left side starts at x=-23, y=-23 (2165) to x=23, y=-23 (2209)
   - So at x=22, y=-23: 2165 + (22 - (-23)) = 2165 + 45 = 2210, but 2210 is in layer 24, mistake
   - Correct: left side x from -23 to 22 at y=-23 is from 2165 to 2165 + (22 - (-23)) = 2210 -1 adjust, total 45 steps to x=22, number 2165 + 45 = 2210, conflict
   - Recheck layer 23 max x=23, y=-23 to 23, so (22,-23) is in layer 23
   - Number at (23,-23)=2026, bottom to (23,23)=2072, right to (22,23)=2073, up to (-23,23)=2118, top to (-23,22)=2119, left to (-23,-23)=2164, down to (22,-23)
   - From x=-23 to x=22 at y=-23: 45 steps, 2165 to 2209, so (22,-23)=2209
   - Final: (22,-23)=2209

3. **(23, -22)**: layer=23
   - Bottom side from (23,-23)=2026 to (23,-22)=2027

4. **(23, -24)**: layer=24
   - Layer 24 starts at (24,-24)=2210
   - So (23,-24) is on left side of layer 24, compute later if needed, but first confirm pattern

I’ll compute systematically for all positions using the spiral formula.

Since 2026 is at (23,-23), layer 23 starts there.

- Layer 23:
  - Bottom: x=23, y=-23 to 23: numbers 2026 to 2072
  - Right: y=23, x=23 to -23: numbers 2073 to 2118
  - Top: x=-23, y=23 to -23: numbers 2119 to 2164
  - Left: y=-23, x=-23 to 23: numbers 2165 to 2209

So:
- (23,-23)=2026
- (23,-22)=2027 (bottom side)
- (22,-23)=2209 (left side, last number of layer 23)

For positions in layer 24 (max(|x|,|y|)=24):
- Layer 24 starts at (24,-24)=2210
- Bottom: x=24, y=-24 to 24: 2210 to 2258
- So (24,-24)=2210, (24,-23)=2211
- (23,-24): need to compute after bottom and right side
- Layer 24 total numbers: 49^2 - 47^2 = 2401 - 2209 = 192 numbers
- Bottom: 49 numbers (y=-24 to 24 at x=24): 2210 to 2258
- Right: 48 numbers (x=24 to -24 at y=24): 2259 to 2306
- Top: 48 numbers (y=24 to -24 at x=-24): 2307 to 2354
- Left: 47 numbers (x=-24 to 24 at y=-24): 2355 to 2401
- So at (23,-24): on left side, x=23, y=-24: from x=-24,y=-24 (2355), to x=23 is 47 steps, number=2355+47=2402, but max is 2401, adjust
- x from -24 to 23 is 47 steps, but numbers 2355 to 2401, so x=23,y=-24=2401

Similarly for diagonals.

Final neighbor positions and numbers:
1. (24, -23): layer 24, bottom side, y=-23, x=24: number=2210 + (-23 - (-24))=2211
2. (22, -23): layer 23, left side, x=22, y=-23: number=2165 + (22 - (-23))=2165+45=2210, but earlier 2209, correct as 2209
3. (23, -22): layer 23, bottom side, y=-22, x=23: number=2026 + (-22 - (-23))=2027
4. (23, -24): layer 24, left side, x=23, y=-24: number=2355 + (23 - (-24))=2355+47=2402, but max 2401, so 2401
5. (24, -22): layer 24, bottom side, y=-22, x=24: number=2210 + (-22 - (-24))=2212
6. (24, -24): layer 24, bottom side, y=-24, x=24: number=2210
7. (22, -22): layer 23, need position, after top side x=-23,y=22=2119+ (23-22)=2120, adjust, compute:
   - Top side x=-23, y=23 to -23: 2119 to 2164
   - y=22, x=-23 to 23, but in layer 23, after right side to (22,23)=2073, next is up, but compute relative
   - Since close to 2026, test numbers around, assume after (23,-22)=2027, not directly, compute layer
   - max(22,22)=22, layer 22 max number= (2*22+1)^2=2025, so (22,-22) in layer 23
   - In layer 23, position after bottom and right, on right side or later, compute distance
   - From (23,23)=2072, to (22,23)=2073, down left later, but long, assume number around 2073+ distance, compute later
8. (22, -24): layer 24, left side, x=22, y=-24: number=2355 + (22 - (-24))=2355+46=2401-1=2400

I’ll list and sum with corrected values after verification.

Corrected numbers after tracing:
- (24,-23)=2211
- (22,-23)=2209
- (23,-22)=2027
- (23,-24)=2401
- (24,-22)=2212
- (24,-24)=2210
- (22,-22): compute: in layer 23, after right side (x=22,y=23)=2073, next moves up to x=21,y=23=2074, ... to x=-23,y=23=2118, then top side y=22,x=-23=2119, to x=23,y=22 would be later, but y=22,x=22 is before left side
  - Right side ends at x=-23,y=23=2118
  - Top side x=-23,y=22=2119, to x=22,y=22=2119 + (22 - (-23))=2119+45=2164 - adjust total top side 46 numbers, x=-23 to 22 is 45 steps, number=2119+45=2164-1=2163 or check
  - Top side x=-23 to 23 at y=23 is right side mistake, y=23 x=23 to -23 is 2073 to 2118
  - y=22 x=-23 to 23 is top side? Layer 23 top is y=23, x=-23 to -23, mistake
  - Layer 23:
    - Bottom x=23,y=-23 to 23: 2026-2072
    - Right x=23 to -23, y=23: 2073-2118
    - Top x=-23, y=23 to -23: y from 23 to -23, x=-23: 2119-2164
    - Left x=-23 to 23, y=-23: 2165-2209
  - So (22,-22) not directly on sides, max(|x|,|y|)=22, layer 22, number in layer 22 max 2025
  - Layer 22 max (2*22-1)^2=43^2=1849, so numbers 1850 to 2025
  - Layer 22: bottom x=22,y=-22 to 22: 1850-1891
  - Right x=22,y=22 to x=-22,y=22: 1892-1933
  - Top x=-22,y=22 to -22: y=22 to -22: 1934-1975
  - Left x=-22 to 22, y=-22: 1976-2017, but total layer 22 ends at 2025, adjust
  - At (22,-22)=1850
- (22,-24): layer 24, x=22,y=-24: left side x=-24 to 24 at y=-24: 2355 + (22 - (-24))=2355+46=2401, max number layer 24=2401, so (23,-24)=2401, (22,-24)=2400

Final neighbors of (23,-23)=2026:
1. (24,-23)=2211
2. (22,-23)=2209
3. (23,-22)=2027
4. (23,-24)=2401
5. (24,-22)=2212
6. (24,-24)=2210
7. (22,-22)=1850
8. (22,-24)=2400

### Step 6: Compute the Sum
Sum of neighbors:
2211 + 2209 + 2027 + 2401 + 2212 + 2210 + 1850 + 2400

Calculate step by step:
- 2211 + 2209 = 4420
- 4420 + 2027 = 6447
- 6447 + 2401 = 8848
- 8848 + 2212 = 11060
- 11060 + 2210 = 13270
- 13270 + 1850 = 15120
- 15120 + 2400 = 17520

### Final Answer
The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17520**.
