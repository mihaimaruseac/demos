To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral grid of natural numbers, we need to determine the positions of the numbers in the spiral and identify the neighbors surrounding 2026. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward in a clockwise manner, as suggested by the given pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Structure
The spiral is constructed on a square grid, starting at the center with 1, then moving right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, and so on, expanding outward in layers (or "rings"). Each ring corresponds to a square layer around the center, and the numbers in each ring increase as we move along the spiral path.

- Ring 0: Just the center (1).
- Ring 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (a 3x3 grid).
- Ring 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (a 5x5 grid).
- Ring 3: Numbers 26 to 49 (a 7x7 grid).
- And so on.

For a ring \( k \), the side length of the square grid is \( 2k + 1 \), and the numbers in that ring range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 \) to \( (2k+1)^2 \). The last number in ring \( k \) is \( (2k+1)^2 \), and the first number in ring \( k+1 \) is \( (2k+1)^2 + 1 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Ring of 2026
We need to find which ring contains the number 2026. We do this by finding the largest odd square less than or equal to 2026, since the last number in each ring is a perfect square of an odd number (i.e., \( (2k+1)^2 \)).

- Compute the square root of 2026: \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 44.99 \).
- The largest odd integer less than or equal to 44.99 is 43 (since 45 is the next odd number but \( 45^2 = 2025 < 2026 \), and we need the ring where 2026 resides).
- Check \( 45^2 = 2025 \), which is less than 2026, so 2025 is the last number in ring \( k \) where \( 2k+1 = 45 \), so \( k = 22 \).
- The next ring (ring 23) starts at \( 2025 + 1 = 2026 \). Thus, 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

For ring \( k = 22 \):
- Side length = \( 2*22 + 1 = 45 \)
- Last number = \( 45^2 = 2025 \)

For ring \( k = 23 \):
- Side length = \( 2*23 + 1 = 47 \)
- First number = \( 2025 + 1 = 2026 \)
- Last number = \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

So, 2026 is indeed the first number in ring 23.

### Step 3: Determine the Position of 2026 in Ring 23
Each ring starts at the bottom-right corner of the square grid for that ring and spirals inward clockwise. For ring \( k \), the first number is placed at the bottom-right corner, which has coordinates relative to the center.

Assign coordinates to the grid with the center (number 1) at (0,0):
- Ring 1 (k=1, side 3): Numbers 2 to 9.
  - 2 is at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1), 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1).
- Ring 2 (k=2, side 5): Starts at (2,-2) with 10, moves up to (2,2)=13, left to (-2,2)=16, down to (-2,-2)=19, right to (1,-2)=22.

Generalizing, for ring \( k \), the first number is at position \( (k, -k) \), and the spiral moves:
- Up from \( (k, -k) \) to \( (k, k) \),
- Left to \( (-k, k) \),
- Down to \( (-k, -k) \),
- Right to \( (k-1, -k) \), and so on, spiraling inward.

For ring 23:
- First number 2026 is at \( (23, -23) \).
- Moves up: y increases from -23 to 23, x=23.
- At y=23, position (23,23), number is 2026 + (23 - (-23)) = 2026 + 46 = 2072.
- Then left: x decreases from 23 to -23, y=23.
- And so on.

Since 2026 is the first number in ring 23, its position is \( (23, -23) \).

### Step 4: Identify the 8 Neighbors of 2026
The 8 neighbors of a position (x,y) are the surrounding positions:
- (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)
- (x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1)

For 2026 at (23, -23), the neighbor positions are:
1. (24, -23)
2. (22, -23)
3. (23, -22)
4. (23, -24)
5. (24, -22)
6. (24, -24)
7. (22, -22)
8. (22, -24)

Since the grid is infinite and filled with natural numbers in the spiral pattern, all these positions have numbers. We need to determine the numbers at these positions.

### Step 5: Determine the Numbers at Neighbor Positions
This is tricky because the neighbors may lie in different rings or parts of the spiral. Let's analyze the positions relative to the rings.

- Ring 23's outer boundary is from x=-23 to 23, y=-23 to 23, but only the outer edges.
- Positions like (24, -23) lie outside ring 23, in ring 24.
- Positions like (22, -23) lie inside, possibly in ring 22 or still in ring 23.

Since computing each position's number directly from the spiral formula is complex, we can approximate or deduce the numbers based on proximity, but it's easier to note the pattern of numbers near the corners.

Let's compute the numbers in ring 23 near 2026:
- At (23, -23): 2026
- Moving up: (23, -22): 2027, (23, -21): 2028, ..., up to (23, 23): 2026 + 46 = 2072
- Then left: (22, 23): 2073, etc.

Now, neighbors:
- (24, -23): This is in ring 24, first number of ring 24 is at (24, -24), number 2210 (since ring 23 ends at 2209).
  - Ring 24 starts at (24, -24)=2210, moves up to (24,24)=2210+48=2258, etc.
  - So at (24, -23): moving up from (24, -24)=2210, y from -24 to -23 is 1 step, so number = 2210 + 1 = 2211.
- (22, -23): This is inside, likely still in ring 23 or near the end of the previous segment.
  - In ring 23, after moving up to (23,23)=2072, left to (22,23)=2073, ..., to (-23,23)=2072+46=2118, then down to (-23,22)=2119, ..., to (-23,-23)=2119+46=2165, then right to (-22,-23)=2166, ..., to (22,-23).
  - From (-23,-23)=2165 to (22,-23), x from -23 to 22, 45 steps, so number = 2165 + 45 = 2210.
  - But 2210 is the start of ring 24, which is at (24,-24), indicating a miscalculation.
  - Total numbers in ring 23: from 2026 to 2209, which is 2209-2025=184 numbers.
  - Ring 23: up 46 steps (2026 to 2072), left 46 steps (2073 to 2118), down 46 steps (2119 to 2164), right 46 steps (2165 to 2210), but 2210 exceeds 2209, so adjust: right segment ends at (23,-23), but (23,-23) is 2026, a contradiction.
  - Correct the count: side length 47, but corners overlap, total numbers = (47)^2 - (45)^2 = 2209 - 2025 = 184.
  - Segments: up from y=-23 to 23 at x=23: 46 steps (y=-23 to 22, numbers 2026 to 2071), then corner turn.
  - Actually, standard spiral: for ring k, start at (k,-k), up to (k,k), left to (-k,k), down to (-k,-k), right to (k-1,-k).
  - So for k=23:
    - Start (23,-23)=2026
    - Up to (23,23)=2026+46=2072
    - Left to (-23,23)=2073 to 2073+46=2119
    - Down to (-23,-23)=2120 to 2120+46=2166
    - Right to (23,-23)=2167 to 2167+46=2213, but must stop at 2209, so right segment ends earlier at x=22 or adjust.
  - Correct total: 184 numbers, 4 segments of 46 each is 184, but positions:
    - Up: y=-23 to 22 (46 numbers, but y=22 is last), so (23,22)=2071, (23,23)=2072
    - Left: x=23 to -22 at y=23, from (22,23)=2073 to (-22,23)=2117 (45 steps? x=23 not counted again), total x=23 to -23 is 46 steps, but adjust.
  - This is getting messy; instead, note (22,-23) is near the end of ring 23's right segment.
  - Ring 23 ends at 2209, likely at (22,-23) or nearby.
  - Compute: after down segment to (-23,-23)=2166, right to x=23, but total numbers 184:
    - Up: 46 numbers (2026-2071 at (23,22))
    - Left: x=23 to -23 at y=23, but (23,23)=2072, so x=22 to -23, 46 numbers (2073 at (22,23) to 2118 at (-23,23))
    - Down: y=23 to -23 at x=-23, y=22 to -23, 46 numbers (2119 at (-23,22) to 2164 at (-23,-23))
    - Right: x=-22 to 22 at y=-23, 45 numbers? Total must be 184-138=46, so x=-22 to 23, but (23,-23)=2026 already, so x=-22 to 22, numbers 2165 at (-22,-23) to 2209 at (22,-23).
  - Yes, (22,-23)=2209 (2165 + 44 steps from x=-22 to 22, 44 steps? x=-22 to 22 is 44 steps, 2165+44=2209, perfect).

So:
- (22,-23)=2209

Now other neighbors:
- (23,-22): in ring 23, up segment, y=-23 is 2026, y=-22 is 2027
- (23,-24): outside, ring 24, but ring 24 starts at (24,-24)=2210, so (23,-24) is in ring 23 or before? No, spiral doesn't go there yet.
  - Ring 23's lowest y is -23, so (23,-24) is outside, in ring 24 or later.
  - Ring 24 starts at (24,-24)=2210, up to (24,24), so at y=-24, x=24 is 2210, then up, so (23,-24) is not in ring 24's path yet, likely in ring 24's right segment later, but compute distance.
  - Approximate: numbers increase outward, near (24,-24)=2210, so (23,-24) might be close.
  - After ring 24 up segment to (24,24)=2258, left to (-24,24)=2259 to 2306, down to (-24,-24)=2307 to 2354, right to (23,-24)=2355 or so.
  - Ring 24: 4 segments, side 48-1=47 steps each approx, total numbers (49)^2 - (47)^2 = 2401-2209=192 numbers.
    - Up: y=-24 to 23 at x=24, 47 steps, 2210 to 2256 at (24,23)
    - Left: x=24 to -23 at y=24, but (24,24)=2257, x=23 to -24, 48 steps? Adjust.
    - Standard: up to (24,24)=2210+48=2258, left to (-24,24)=2259 to 2306, down to (-24,-24)=2307 to 2354, right to (24,-24)=2355 to 2401, but adjust.
    - Total 192 numbers, roughly 48 per side.
    - Right segment: from x=-23 to 23 at y=-24, after down segment to (-24,-24)=2354, right to x=23, number 2355 at (-23,-24) to 2401 at (23,-24).
    - So (23,-24)=2401
- (24,-22): ring 24, up segment, (24,-24)=2210, y=-23 is 2211, y=-22 is 2212
- (24,-24)=2210
- (22,-22): near (22,-23)=2209, in ring 23, right segment, x=22, y=-23 is 2209, but y=-22 is next ring or adjust, likely ring 23 ends at (22,-23)=2209, so (22,-22) is in previous ring or next.
  - Check position: after right segment to (22,-23)=2209, next number is ring 24 at (24,-24)=2210, so (22,-22) must be in inner ring.
  - In ring 22, last number 2025 at (22,-22), because ring 22: side 45, last segment right from x=-22 to 22 at y=-22, numbers from (45^2 - 3*44) or compute:
    - Ring 22: numbers 1849+1 to 2025, total (45^2)-(43^2)=2025-1849=176 numbers.
    - Up: y=-22 to 22 at x=22, 44 steps, numbers 1850 to 1893 at (22,21)
    - Left: x=22 to -22 at y=22, 44 steps, 1894 at (21,22) to 1937 at (-22,22)
    - Down: y=22 to -22 at x=-22, 44 steps, 1938 at (-22,21) to 1981 at (-22,-22)
    - Right: x=-21 to 22 at y=-22, 44 steps, 1982 at (-21,-22) to 2025 at (22,-22)
  - So (22,-22)=2025
- (22,-24): likely in ring 23 or 24, near (22,-23)=2209, but y=-24 is outside ring 23's path, so in ring 24's right segment, near (23,-24)=2401, x=22 is one before, so approx 2400
  - Ring 24 right segment: x=-23 to 23 at y=-24, numbers 2355 at (-23,-24) to 2401 at (23,-24), so x=22 is 2401-1=2400
- (24,-23)=2211 (as computed earlier)

Summarizing the neighbors of (23,-23)=2026:
1. (24,-23)=2211
2. (22,-23)=2209
3. (23,-22)=2027
4. (23,-24)=2401
5. (24,-22)=2212
6. (24,-24)=2210
7. (22,-22)=2025
8. (22,-24)=2400

### Step 6: Compute the Sum of Neighbors
Sum = 2211 + 2209 + 2027 + 2401 + 2212 + 2210 + 2025 + 2400

Calculate step by step:
- 2211 + 2209 = 4420
- 4420 + 2027 = 6447
- 6447 + 2401 = 8848
- 8848 + 2212 = 11060
- 11060 + 2210 = 13270
- 13270 + 2025 = 15295
- 15295 + 2400 = 17695

### Final Answer
The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17695**.
