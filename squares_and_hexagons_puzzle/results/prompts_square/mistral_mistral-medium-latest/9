Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand how the numbers are arranged in the spiral and then determine the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral to understand how the numbers are arranged:

```
... 5  4  3
... 6  1  2
... 7  8  9
...
```

From this, we can see that the number `1` is at the center. The numbers increase as we move outward in a counterclockwise spiral:

- `1` is at the center.
- `2` is to the right of `1`.
- `3` is above `2`.
- `4` is to the left of `3`.
- `5` is above `4`.
- `6` is to the left of `5`.
- `7` is below `6`.
- `8` is below `7` (to the left of `1`).
- `9` is to the right of `8` (below `2`).
- And so on...

This pattern continues outward, forming concentric squares around the center.

### Identifying the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of a specific number like `2026`, we need to determine its position in the spiral. One way to do this is to find out which "layer" or "ring" the number is in.

Let's define the layers as follows:

- **Layer 0**: Just the center number `1`.
- **Layer 1**: The numbers forming the first square around `1`, which are `2` to `9`.
- **Layer 2**: The next square, which would be `10` to `25`.
- And so on...

Generally, the `n`-th layer (for `n >= 1`) contains numbers from `(2n - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2n + 1)^2`.

For example:
- Layer 1: `(2*1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` to `(2*1 + 1)^2 = 9`
- Layer 2: `(2*2 - 1)^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10` to `(2*2 + 1)^2 = 25`
- Layer 3: `25 + 1 = 26` to `49`
- And so forth.

### Finding the Layer for 2026

We need to find the smallest `n` such that `(2n + 1)^2 >= 2026`.

Let's solve for `n`:

`(2n + 1)^2 >= 2026`
`2n + 1 >= sqrt(2026)`
`sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01`
So, `2n + 1 >= 46` (since we need an integer)
`2n >= 45`
`n >= 22.5`
Since `n` is an integer, `n = 23`.

So, `2026` is in layer `23`.

Now, let's find the range of numbers in layer `23`:

Start: `(2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`
End: `(2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209`

So, layer `23` goes from `2026` to `2209`.

This means `2026` is the first number in layer `23`.

### Determining the Position of 2026

In each layer, the numbers are arranged in a square. The first number of the layer is always at the bottom right corner of the square.

For layer `n`, the bottom right corner is at position `(n, -n)` if we consider the center `1` at `(0, 0)`, positive x to the right, positive y upwards.

But let's define coordinates more carefully.

Let's place `1` at `(0, 0)`.

Then, the first layer (layer 1) has:
- `2` at `(1, 0)`
- `3` at `(1, 1)`
- `4` at `(0, 1)`
- `5` at `(-1, 1)`
- `6` at `(-1, 0)`
- `7` at `(-1, -1)`
- `8` at `(0, -1)`
- `9` at `(1, -1)`

Similarly, layer `n` starts at `(n, -n + 1)` and goes around.

But a better approach is to note that the first number in layer `n` is at `(n, -n + 1)`.

Given that `2026` is the first number in layer `23`, its position is `(23, -22)`.

Wait, let's verify the starting position for layer `n`:

For layer `1`:
First number is `2` at `(1, 0)` (which is `(n, -n + 1) = (1, 0)`).

For layer `2`:
First number is `10` at `(2, -1)` (`(n, -n + 1) = (2, -1)`).

So, for layer `23`, first number `2026` is at `(23, -22)`.

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026

Now, we need to find all 8 neighbors of `2026`, which are the numbers adjacent to it in the grid, including diagonals.

Given `2026` is at `(23, -22)`, its neighbors are at:

1. `(22, -22)` - left
2. `(24, -22)` - right
3. `(23, -21)` - above
4. `(23, -23)` - below
5. `(22, -21)` - top-left
6. `(24, -21)` - top-right
7. `(22, -23)` - bottom-left
8. `(24, -23)` - bottom-right

Now, we need to find out which numbers are at these positions.

### Calculating the Numbers at Neighboring Positions

To find the number at a given position `(x, y)`, we can determine which layer it's in and its position within that layer.

The layer `n` for a position `(x, y)` is `max(|x|, |y|)`.

For example, `(23, -22)` is in layer `23` because `max(23, 22) = 23`.

Similarly, let's find the layer for each neighbor:

1. `(22, -22)`: `max(22, 22) = 22` → layer `22`
2. `(24, -22)`: `max(24, 22) = 24` → layer `24`
3. `(23, -21)`: `max(23, 21) = 23` → layer `23`
4. `(23, -23)`: `max(23, 23) = 23` → layer `23`
5. `(22, -21)`: `max(22, 21) = 22` → layer `22`
6. `(24, -21)`: `max(24, 21) = 24` → layer `24`
7. `(22, -23)`: `max(22, 23) = 23` → layer `23`
8. `(24, -23)`: `max(24, 23) = 24` → layer `24`

Now, let's find the numbers at these positions.

#### General Approach to Find Number at (x, y):

The number at `(x, y)` can be found by determining its position in its layer.

For layer `n`, the numbers start at `(n, -n + 1)` with the first number `(2n - 1)^2 + 1`, and go around the square.

The square has side length `2n + 1`, but the perimeter is `8n` (since each side has `2n` numbers, but corners are shared).

But a better way is to note that the number at `(x, y)` in layer `n` can be calculated based on its position along the perimeter.

Alternatively, we can use the following method:

The number at `(x, y)` is:

- If `x > y` and `x > -y`: top side
- If `y > x` and `y > -x`: right side
- If `-x > y` and `-x > -y`: bottom side
- If `-y > x` and `-y > -x`: left side

But this might be complex. Instead, let's find the number by moving from the start of the layer.

For layer `n`, the first number is at `(n, -n + 1)`, which is `(2n - 1)^2 + 1`.

Then, moving up (increasing y) until `(n, n)`, then left (decreasing x) until `(-n, n)`, then down (decreasing y) until `(-n, -n)`, then right (increasing x) until `(n, -n)`.

The number increases by 1 at each step.

So, to find the number at `(x, y)` in layer `n`:

1. Start at `(n, -n + 1)` with number `(2n - 1)^2 + 1`.
2. Move up to `(n, y)`: steps = y - (-n + 1) = y + n - 1
   - Number = `(2n - 1)^2 + 1 + (y + n - 1)`
3. Then move left to `(x, y)`: steps = n - x
   - Number = previous + (n - x)

Similarly for other sides.

But this seems involved. Maybe a better approach is to note that the number at `(x, y)` is:

`number = (max(|x|, |y|) * 2 - 1)^2 + offset`

Where `offset` is calculated based on the position along the perimeter.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the number at `(x, y)` is:

If `x >= |y|` (top side):
`number = (2x - 1)^2 + (x + y)`

If `y >= |x|` (right side):
`number = (2y + 1)^2 - (y - x)`

If `-x >= |y|` (bottom side):
`number = (2|x| + 1)^2 - (|x| - y)`

If `-y >= |x|` (left side):
`number = (2|y| - 1)^2 + (|y| + x)`

This seems more straightforward.

Let's apply this to our neighbors.

#### Calculating Each Neighbor:

1. `(22, -22)`:
   `-y = 22 >= |x| = 22` → left side
   `number = (2*22 - 1)^2 + (22 + 22) = 43^2 + 44 = 1849 + 44 = 1893`

2. `(24, -22)`:
   `x = 24 >= |y| = 22` → top side
   `number = (2*24 - 1)^2 + (24 + (-22)) = 47^2 + 2 = 2209 + 2 = 2211`

3. `(23, -21)`:
   `x = 23 >= |y| = 21` → top side
   `number = (2*23 - 1)^2 + (23 + (-21)) = 45^2 + 2 = 2025 + 2 = 2027`

4. `(23, -23)`:
   `-y = 23 >= |x| = 23` → left side
   `number = (2*23 - 1)^2 + (23 + 23) = 45^2 + 46 = 2025 + 46 = 2071`

5. `(22, -21)`:
   `x = 22 >= |y| = 21` → top side
   `number = (2*22 - 1)^2 + (22 + (-21)) = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`

6. `(24, -21)`:
   `x = 24 >= |y| = 21` → top side
   `number = (2*24 - 1)^2 + (24 + (-21)) = 47^2 + 3 = 2209 + 3 = 2212`

7. `(22, -23)`:
   `-y = 23 >= |x| = 22` → left side
   `number = (2*23 - 1)^2 + (23 + 22) = 45^2 + 45 = 2025 + 45 = 2070`

8. `(24, -23)`:
   `x = 24 >= |y| = 23` → top side
   `number = (2*24 - 1)^2 + (24 + (-23)) = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210`

### Verifying the Calculations

Let's verify a couple to ensure our formula is correct.

For `(23, -22)` (which is `2026`):
`x = 23 >= |y| = 22` → top side
`number = (2*23 - 1)^2 + (23 + (-22)) = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026` ✔

For `(23, -21)`:
`number = 2027` (as calculated), which is `2026 + 1` (moving up from `(23, -22)` to `(23, -21)`), seems correct.

Similarly, `(22, -22)` is `1893`, which is in layer `22` (from `1849 + 1` to `2025`), and `1893` is within this range.

### Summing Up the Neighbors

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors with their numbers:

1. `(22, -22)`: 1893
2. `(24, -22)`: 2211
3. `(23, -21)`: 2027
4. `(23, -23)`: 2071
5. `(22, -21)`: 1850
6. `(24, -21)`: 2212
7. `(22, -23)`: 2070
8. `(24, -23)`: 2210

Now, sum them up:

`1893 + 2211 = 4104`
`4104 + 2027 = 6131`
`6131 + 2071 = 8202`
`8202 + 1850 = 10052`
`10052 + 2212 = 12264`
`12264 + 2070 = 14334`
`14334 + 2210 = 16544`

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number `2026` is **16544**.
