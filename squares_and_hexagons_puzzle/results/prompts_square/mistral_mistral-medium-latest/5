Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand the spiral layout and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral to understand how the numbers are arranged:

```
... 5  4  3
... 6  1  2
... 7  8  9
...
```

From this, we can see that the number `1` is at the center. The numbers spiral outwards in a counterclockwise direction:

- `1` is at the center.
- `2` is to the right of `1`.
- `3` is above `2`.
- `4` is to the left of `3`.
- `5` is above `4`.
- `6` is to the left of `5`.
- `7` is below `6`.
- `8` is below `7`.
- `9` is to the right of `8`.
- And so on...

This forms a square spiral where each "layer" or "ring" around the center increases the size of the square by 2 in both dimensions.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of `2026`, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. This involves finding out which "ring" or "layer" it's in and its exact coordinates within that ring.

**Rings in the Spiral:**
- The center is `1` (Ring 0).
- The first ring around `1` contains numbers `2` to `9` (Ring 1).
- The second ring contains numbers `10` to `25` (Ring 2).
- Generally, Ring `n` contains numbers from `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`.

The number of numbers in Ring `n` is `(2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = 8n`.

**Finding the Ring for 2026:**
We need to find the smallest `n` such that `(2n+1)^2 >= 2026`.

Let's calculate:

- `(2n+1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 >= 2026`
- `4n^2 + 4n - 2025 >= 0`

Solving the quadratic equation `4n^2 + 4n - 2025 = 0`:

Using the quadratic formula: `n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)`

Here, `a = 4`, `b = 4`, `c = -2025`:

`n = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 32400)] / 8 = [-4 ± sqrt(32416)] / 8`

`sqrt(32416) ≈ 180.04`

So, `n ≈ (-4 + 180.04)/8 ≈ 176.04 / 8 ≈ 22.005`

Thus, `n ≈ 22`. Let's check:

For `n = 22`:
`(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
`(2*21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849`

So, Ring 22 starts at `1849 + 1 = 1850` and ends at `2025`.
Ring 23 starts at `2026`.

Wait, this seems off because `2026` is the first number of Ring 23, not in Ring 22.

Wait, let's re-examine the ring numbering.

Actually, the center is Ring 0 (`1`), Ring 1 is `2` to `9`, Ring 2 is `10` to `25`, etc.

So, Ring `n` starts at `(2n-1)^2 + 1` and ends at `(2n+1)^2`.

For `n=22`:
Start: `(2*22 -1)^2 +1 = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850`
End: `(2*22 +1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`

So Ring 22: 1850 to 2025
Ring 23: 2026 to ?

`(2*23 +1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209`

So Ring 23: 2026 to 2209

Thus, `2026` is the first number in Ring 23.

### Structure of a Ring

Each ring `n` (for `n >= 1`) has:

- Bottom right corner: `(2n+1)^2`
- Bottom left corner: `(2n+1)^2 - 2n`
- Top left corner: `(2n+1)^2 - 4n`
- Top right corner: `(2n+1)^2 - 6n`
- The numbers increase as we go right, up, left, down.

For Ring 23 (`n=23`):

- Bottom right: `47^2 = 2209`
- Bottom left: `2209 - 46 = 2163`
- Top left: `2209 - 92 = 2117`
- Top right: `2209 - 138 = 2071`

The numbers in Ring 23 go from `2026` to `2209`.

The sequence is:

- Right side (from top right to bottom right): `2071 + 1` to `2209` (139 numbers)
Wait, no.

Actually, the first number in Ring `n` is `(2n-1)^2 + 1`.

For `n=23`: `(2*23 -1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1 = 2026`

The numbers in Ring `n` are from `(2n-1)^2 +1` to `(2n+1)^2`.

The sides are:

1. Right side: `(2n-1)^2 +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n` (top right to bottom right)
2. Top side: `(2n-1)^2 + 2n +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 4n` (right to left)
3. Left side: `(2n-1)^2 + 4n +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 6n` (top left to bottom left)
4. Bottom side: `(2n-1)^2 + 6n +1` to `(2n+1)^2` (left to right)

For `n=23`:

1. Right: `2026` to `2026 + 46 = 2072` (47 numbers)
Wait, no, `(2n-1)^2 +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n` is `2026` to `2026 + 46 = 2072` (47 numbers, but the side length is `2n` for the outer square, but the count is `2n` numbers per side, but the first side is `2n` numbers starting from `(2n-1)^2 +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n`).

Wait, the side length is `2n + 1` for the outer square, but the numbers per side are `2n` for the first side, then `2n-1` for the next, etc., but actually, each side has `2n` numbers except the first side which has `2n` numbers starting from `(2n-1)^2 +1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n`.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates.

### Assigning Coordinates to Numbers

Let's assign coordinates to the numbers where `1` is at `(0,0)`.

The spiral moves in the order: right, up, left, down, right, etc.

The number at position `(x,y)` can be determined by the ring it's in and its position within the ring.

For Ring `n` (`n >= 1`):

- The bottom right corner is at `(n, -n)` with value `(2n+1)^2`.
- The bottom left corner is at `(-n, -n)` with value `(2n+1)^2 - 2n`.
- The top left corner is at `(-n, n)` with value `(2n+1)^2 - 4n`.
- The top right corner is at `(n, n)` with value `(2n+1)^2 - 6n`.

The numbers decrease as we go counterclockwise from the bottom right corner.

But `2026` is the first number in Ring 23, which is at the position just to the right of the bottom right corner of Ring 22.

The bottom right corner of Ring 22 is at `(22, -22)` with value `45^2 = 2025`.

So, `2026` is at `(23, -22)` (one step right from `(22, -22)`).

Now, let's find the coordinates of `2026` and its neighbors.

### Coordinates of 2026

From above, `2026` is at `(23, -22)`.

### Finding the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of `(x,y)` are:

- `(x-1, y-1)`, `(x, y-1)`, `(x+1, y-1)`
- `(x-1, y)`, `(x+1, y)`
- `(x-1, y+1)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x+1, y+1)`

So, for `(23, -22)`:

1. `(22, -23)`
2. `(23, -23)`
3. `(24, -23)`
4. `(22, -22)`
5. `(24, -22)`
6. `(22, -21)`
7. `(23, -21)`
8. `(24, -21)`

Now, we need to find the numbers at these coordinates.

### Determining Numbers at Given Coordinates

To find the number at a given `(x,y)`, we can determine which ring it's in and its position within the ring.

The ring number `n` is `max(|x|, |y|)`.

For each neighbor:

1. `(22, -23)`: `n = 23`
   - This is on the left side of Ring 23.
   - The left side goes from `(-23, -22)` to `(-23, 22)`.
   - `(22, -23)` is not on the left side; actually, the left side is `x = -n`.
   - Wait, no, the left side is `x = -n`, `y` from `-n+1` to `n`.
   - `(22, -23)`: `x=22`, `y=-23`, `n=23`.
   - This is on the bottom side of Ring 23, where `y = -n`, `x` from `-n+1` to `n`.
   - Bottom side: `(x, -23)` from `x=-22` to `x=23`.
   - The number at `(x, -n)` is `(2n+1)^2 - (n - x)` for `x` from `-n` to `n`.
   - Wait, no, the bottom side starts at `(n, -n)` with value `(2n+1)^2`, and decreases as `x` decreases.
   - So, `(x, -n)` has value `(2n+1)^2 - (n - x)`.
   - For `(22, -23)`: `n=23`, `x=22`.
   - Value = `47^2 - (23 - 22) = 2209 - 1 = 2208`.

2. `(23, -23)`: `n=23`
   - Bottom side: `(x, -23)`, `x=23` is the end.
   - Value = `(2n+1)^2 - (n - x) = 2209 - (23 - 23) = 2209 - 0 = 2209`.

3. `(24, -23)`: `n=24` (since `max(24,23)=24`)
   - This is outside Ring 23, so it's in Ring 24.
   - The first number in Ring 24 is `(2*24-1)^2 +1 = 47^2 +1 = 2209 +1 = 2210`.
   - `(24, -23)` is the first number in Ring 24, so `2210`.

4. `(22, -22)`: `n=22`
   - This is the bottom right corner of Ring 22: `(22, -22)` with value `(2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`.

5. `(24, -22)`: `n=24`
   - This is in Ring 24, on the right side.
   - The right side of Ring 24 goes from `(23, -24)` to `(24, -24)` to `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`.
   - Wait, no, the right side is `(n, y)` from `y=-n` to `y=n`.
   - `(24, -22)` is on the right side of Ring 24.
   - The first number on the right side is `(n, -n)` with value `(2n-1)^2 +1`.
   - For `n=24`: `(2*24-1)^2 +1 = 47^2 +1 = 2209 +1 = 2210`.
   - Then, `(24, -23)` is `2210 +1 = 2211`.
   - `(24, -22)` is `2210 + ( -22 - (-24) ) = 2210 + 2 = 2212`.

6. `(22, -21)`: `n=22`
   - This is on the right side of Ring 22.
   - Right side: `(22, y)` from `y=-21` to `y=22`.
   - The first number is `(22, -21)` with value `(2*22-1)^2 +1 = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850`.
   - So, `(22, -21)` is `1850`.

7. `(23, -21)`: `n=23`
   - This is on the right side of Ring 23.
   - Right side: `(23, y)` from `y=-22` to `y=23`.
   - The first number is `(23, -22)` with value `(2*23-1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1 = 2026`.
   - Then, `(23, -21)` is `2026 + ( -21 - (-22) ) = 2026 +1 = 2027`.

8. `(24, -21)`: `n=24`
   - This is on the right side of Ring 24.
   - As before, `(24, -24)` is `2210`, `(24, -23)` is `2211`, ..., `(24, -21)` is `2210 + ( -21 - (-24) ) = 2210 +3 = 2213`.

### Listing the Neighbors and Their Values

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors with their values:

1. `(22, -23)`: `2208`
2. `(23, -23)`: `2209`
3. `(24, -23)`: `2210`
4. `(22, -22)`: `2025`
5. `(24, -22)`: `2212`
6. `(22, -21)`: `1850`
7. `(23, -21)`: `2027`
8. `(24, -21)`: `2213`

### Calculating the Sum of the Neighbors

Now, sum all these values:

`2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2212 + 1850 + 2027 + 2213`

Let's add them step by step:

- `2208 + 2209 = 4417`
- `4417 + 2210 = 6627`
- `6627 + 2025 = 8652`
- `8652 + 2212 = 10864`
- `10864 + 1850 = 12714`
- `12714 + 2027 = 14741`
- `14741 + 2213 = 16954`

### Verifying the Calculations

Let me double-check the addition to ensure no mistakes:

`2208 + 2209 = 4417`
`4417 + 2210 = 6627`
`6627 + 2025 = 8652`
`8652 + 2212 = 10864`
`10864 + 1850 = 12714`
`12714 + 2027 = 14741`
`14741 + 2213 = 16954`

The addition seems correct.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number `2026` is **16954**.
