Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand the spiral layout and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral to understand how the numbers are arranged:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the number `1` is at the center. The numbers increase as we move outward in a counterclockwise spiral:

- To the right of `1` is `2`.
- Above `2` is `3`.
- To the left of `3` is `4`, and so on.

This is a classic Ulam spiral, where numbers are arranged in a square grid spiraling outward from the center.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of `2026`, we first need to determine its position in the grid. That is, we need to find out which "layer" or "ring" it's in and its coordinates within that ring.

**Layers of the Spiral:**

The spiral can be thought of as concentric squares (layers) around the center (`1`). Each layer `n` (where `n >= 1`) is a square with side length `2n + 1`. The number of elements in layer `n` is `(2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 8n` (for `n >= 1`).

Let's find out which layer `2026` is in.

The number at the bottom-right corner of layer `n` is `(2n + 1)^2`. For example:

- Layer 0: `(2*0 + 1)^2 = 1` (just the center)
- Layer 1: `(2*1 + 1)^2 = 9` (numbers 2 to 9)
- Layer 2: `(2*2 + 1)^2 = 25` (numbers 10 to 25)
- ...
- Layer `k`: `(2k + 1)^2`

We need to find the smallest `k` such that `(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`.

Let's solve for `k`:

`(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`
`2k + 1 >= sqrt(2026)`
`2k + 1 >= 45.011...` (since 45^2 = 2025, 46^2 = 2116)
`2k >= 44.011...`
`k >= 22.005...`

So, `k = 22`.

This means `2026` is in layer `22`.

The largest number in layer `21` is `(2*21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849`.
The largest number in layer `22` is `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`.

Wait a minute, this suggests that `2026` is the first number in layer `23`, not layer `22`, because `2025` is the last number in layer `22` (since `45^2 = 2025`), and `2026` starts layer `23`.

Let me re-examine:

Layer `n` starts at `(2n - 1)^2 + 1` and ends at `(2n + 1)^2`.

So, layer `22` starts at `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850` and ends at `45^2 = 2025`.

Layer `23` starts at `45^2 + 1 = 2026` and ends at `47^2 = 2209`.

Therefore, `2026` is the first number in layer `23`.

### Finding the Coordinates of 2026

Now, let's assign coordinates to the numbers. We'll place `1` at `(0, 0)`. Then:

- Right: `(1, 0)` is `2`
- Up: `(1, 1)` is `3`
- Left: `(0, 1)` is `4`, `(-1, 1)` is `5`, etc.
- Down: `(-1, 0)` is `6`, `(-1, -1)` is `7`, etc.
- Right: `(0, -1)` is `8`, `(1, -1)` is `9`, etc.

This pattern continues outward.

To find the coordinates of `2026`, we can observe that each layer starts one step to the right of the bottom-right corner of the previous layer.

The bottom-right corner of layer `n` is `(n, -n)` with value `(2n + 1)^2`.

So, layer `22` ends at `(22, -22)` with value `2025`.
Layer `23` starts at `(23, -22)` with value `2026`.

Therefore, `2026` is at `(23, -22)`.

### Verifying the Position

Let's verify this by checking the positions around `2026`:

- The number before `2026` is `2025` at `(22, -22)`.
- Moving right from `(22, -22)` to `(23, -22)` gives `2026`.

This seems correct.

### Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

The 8 neighbors of a number in the grid are the cells surrounding it, including diagonals. For `(x, y)`, the neighbors are:

- `(x-1, y-1)`, `(x, y-1)`, `(x+1, y-1)`
- `(x-1, y)`, `(x+1, y)`
- `(x-1, y+1)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x+1, y+1)`

So, for `(23, -22)`, the neighbors are:

1. `(22, -23)`
2. `(23, -23)`
3. `(24, -23)`
4. `(22, -22)`
5. `(24, -22)`
6. `(22, -21)`
7. `(23, -21)`
8. `(24, -21)`

Now, we need to find out what numbers these coordinates correspond to.

### Determining the Numbers at Neighboring Coordinates

To find the number at a given `(x, y)`, we can trace the spiral path. However, this can be time-consuming for large coordinates. Instead, we can use the fact that the spiral is built in layers and find the number based on its position in the layer.

Given that `2026` is at `(23, -22)`, which is the first number in layer `23`, let's see how the numbers progress in layer `23`:

Layer `23` starts at `(23, -22)` with `2026` and goes up to `(23, 23)` with `2209`.

The sequence in layer `23` is:

1. Right: `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)`: `2026` to `2026 + 45 = 2071` (since we move up 45 steps in y from -22 to 23)
2. Up: `(22, 23)` to `(-23, 23)`: `2072` to `2072 + 45 = 2117`
3. Left: `(-23, 22)` to `(-23, -23)`: `2118` to `2118 + 45 = 2163`
4. Down: `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)`: `2164` to `2164 + 45 = 2209`

But we don't need the entire layer; we just need the numbers around `2026` at `(23, -22)`.

Let's find each neighbor:

1. `(22, -23)`: This is the last number in the "down" segment of layer `22`, which is `(22, -22)` is `2025`, so `(22, -23)` is `2025 - 1 = 2024`.
   Wait, no. `(22, -22)` is `2025`, and `(22, -23)` is the next in the down direction, which would be `2025 + 1 = 2026`? Wait, no, `(23, -22)` is `2026`, so `(22, -23)` is before that in the spiral.

   Actually, the spiral goes:
   - `(22, -22)`: `2025`
   - `(23, -22)`: `2026`
   - `(23, -21)`: `2027`
   - ...
   So `(22, -23)` is not directly before `(23, -22)`. It's the one below `(22, -22)`.

   The number at `(22, -23)` is `(22, -22)` is `2025`, and moving down decreases y by 1, which in the spiral corresponds to adding 1 to the number (since after `(22, -22)` we go right to `(23, -22)`). Wait, no, the spiral goes right, then up, then left, then down.

   Actually, the sequence is:
   - `(22, -22)`: `2025`
   - `(23, -22)`: `2026`
   - `(23, -21)`: `2027`
   - ...
   So `(22, -23)` is not directly in the sequence. It's part of the previous layer's down segment.

   The down segment of layer `n` goes from `(n, -n)` to `(-n, -n)` to `(-n, -n+1)` to `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, -n+2)`, etc., but actually, the down segment is from `(n, -n+1)` to `(n, -n)` to `(n-1, -n)` to `(-n, -n)` to `(-n, -n+1)` to `(-n+1, -n+1)`, etc.

   This is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to find the number at each neighbor coordinate by tracing the spiral.

Given the complexity, let's try to find a general formula or pattern.

### General Approach to Find Number at (x, y)

There's a mathematical way to determine the number at any coordinate `(x, y)` in the spiral. Here's how:

1. Determine the layer `n` where the point lies. `n = max(|x|, |y|)`.
2. The largest number in layer `n-1` is `(2(n-1) + 1)^2 = (2n - 1)^2`.
3. The smallest number in layer `n` is `(2n - 1)^2 + 1`.
4. The layer `n` starts at `(n, -(n-1))` with number `(2n - 1)^2 + 1`.
5. The sequence in layer `n` is:
   - Right: `(n, -(n-1))` to `(n, n)`: `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n`
   - Up: `(n-1, n)` to `(-n, n)`: `(2n-1)^2 + 2n + 1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 4n`
   - Left: `(-n, n-1)` to `(-n, -n)`: `(2n-1)^2 + 4n + 1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 6n`
   - Down: `(-n+1, -n)` to `(n, -n)`: `(2n-1)^2 + 6n + 1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 8n` = `(2n+1)^2`

Given `(x, y) = (23, -22)`, `n = max(23, 22) = 23`.

The largest number in layer `22` is `(2*22 - 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849`.
The smallest number in layer `23` is `1849 + 1 = 1850`.

But we have `2026` at `(23, -22)`, which is in layer `23`.

Wait, earlier we saw that `(23, -22)` is `2026`, which is the first number in layer `23` (since `2025` is at `(22, -22)`).

But `(2n-1)^2 + 1 = (2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`. So `(23, -22)` is indeed `2026`.

Now, let's find the numbers at the neighboring coordinates.

#### Neighbor 1: `(22, -23)`

This is in layer `n = max(22, 23) = 23`.

The down segment of layer `23` goes from `(23, -22)` to `(23, -23)` to `(22, -23)` to `(-23, -23)` to `(-23, -22)`.

The numbers in the down segment are:

`(2n-1)^2 + 6n + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`.

For `n=23`:

`(2*23 - 1)^2 + 6*23 + 1 = 45^2 + 138 + 1 = 2025 + 139 = 2164` to `47^2 = 2209`.

The sequence is:

`(23, -22)`: `2026` (but this is the start of the layer, not the down segment)
Wait, no, the down segment starts after the left segment.

Actually, the order is:

1. Right: `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)`: `2026` to `2026 + 45 = 2071`
2. Up: `(22, 23)` to `(-23, 23)`: `2072` to `2072 + 45 = 2117`
3. Left: `(-23, 22)` to `(-23, -23)`: `2118` to `2118 + 45 = 2163`
4. Down: `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)`: `2164` to `2164 + 45 = 2209`

So `(22, -23)` is in the down segment.

The down segment starts at `(-22, -23)` with `2164` and goes right to `(23, -23)` with `2209`.

The number at `(x, -23)` in the down segment is `2164 + (x - (-22)) = 2164 + (x + 22)`.

So `(22, -23)`: `2164 + (22 + 22) = 2164 + 44 = 2208`.

Wait, let's check:

`(-22, -23)`: `2164`
`(-21, -23)`: `2165`
...
`(0, -23)`: `2164 + 22 = 2186`
...
`(22, -23)`: `2164 + 44 = 2208`
`(23, -23)`: `2164 + 45 = 2209`

So `(22, -23)` is `2208`.

#### Neighbor 2: `(23, -23)`

This is the last number in the down segment: `2209`.

#### Neighbor 3: `(24, -23)`

This is outside layer `23`, so it's in layer `24`.

The first number in layer `24` is `(2*24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210` at `(24, -23)`.

So `(24, -23)` is `2210`.

#### Neighbor 4: `(22, -22)`

This is in layer `22`.

The largest number in layer `21` is `(2*21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849`.
The largest number in layer `22` is `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`.

`(22, -22)` is the bottom-right corner of layer `22`, so it's `2025`.

#### Neighbor 5: `(24, -22)`

This is in layer `24`.

The first number in layer `24` is `2210` at `(24, -23)`.
The next is `(24, -22)`: `2211`.

#### Neighbor 6: `(22, -21)`

This is in layer `22`.

The right segment of layer `22` is `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)`: `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850` to `1850 + 44 = 1894`.

`(22, -21)` is the first in this segment: `1850`.

#### Neighbor 7: `(23, -21)`

This is in layer `23`.

The right segment of layer `23` is `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)`: `2026` to `2026 + 45 = 2071`.

`(23, -21)` is the second in this segment: `2026 + 1 = 2027`.

#### Neighbor 8: `(24, -21)`

This is in layer `24`.

The right segment of layer `24` is `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`: `2210` to `2210 + 47 = 2257`.

`(24, -21)` is the third in this segment: `2210 + 2 = 2212`.

### Listing All Neighbors and Their Numbers

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors with their numbers:

1. `(22, -23)`: `2208`
2. `(23, -23)`: `2209`
3. `(24, -23)`: `2210`
4. `(22, -22)`: `2025`
5. `(24, -22)`: `2211`
6. `(22, -21)`: `1850`
7. `(23, -21)`: `2027`
8. `(24, -21)`: `2212`

### Calculating the Sum of the Neighbors

Now, sum all these numbers:

`2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212`

Let's add them step by step:

- `2208 + 2209 = 4417`
- `4417 + 2210 = 6627`
- `6627 + 2025 = 8652`
- `8652 + 2211 = 10863`
- `10863 + 1850 = 12713`
- `12713 + 2027 = 14740`
- `14740 + 2212 = 16952`

### Verifying the Sum

Let me double-check the addition to ensure no mistakes:

`2208 + 2209 = 4417`
`4417 + 2210 = 6627`
`6627 + 2025 = 8652`
`8652 + 2211 = 10863`
`10863 + 1850 = 12713`
`12713 + 2027 = 14740`
`14740 + 2212 = 16952`

The sum checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number `2026` in the spiral is **16952**.
