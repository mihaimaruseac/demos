Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand the spiral layout and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the spiral based on the given example:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This seems to be a small portion of an infinite spiral where the natural numbers are arranged in a square grid, starting from 1 at the center and spiraling outward. Here's how the numbers are placed:

- The center is 1.
- To the right of 1 is 2.
- Above 2 is 3.
- To the left of 3 is 4, and so on, spiraling outward.

### Extending the Spiral

Let's try to extend this spiral to include more numbers to see if we can find a pattern or a way to locate any given number, like 2026.

Here's a larger portion of the spiral:

```
... 17 16 15 14 13
... 18  5  4  3 12
... 19  6  1  2 11
... 20  7  8  9 10
... 21 22 23 ...
```

From this, we can observe that the numbers are arranged in concentric squares around the center (1). Each "layer" or "ring" around the center forms a square with increasing side lengths.

### Identifying Layers or Rings

Let's define the layers based on how far they are from the center:

- **Layer 0**: Just the number 1 at the center.
- **Layer 1**: The numbers forming the immediate square around 1, which are 2 to 9.
- **Layer 2**: The next square, which are 10 to 25.
- And so on...

Each layer `k` (where `k >= 1`) contains numbers from `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2k + 1)^2`.

For example:
- Layer 1: (2*1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 to (2*1 + 1)^2 = 9
- Layer 2: (2*2 - 1)^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 to (2*2 + 1)^2 = 25
- Layer 3: 25 + 1 = 26 to 49
- And so on.

### Determining the Layer for 2026

To find out which layer 2026 is in, we need to find the smallest `k` such that `(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`.

Let's solve for `k`:

`(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`
`2k + 1 >= sqrt(2026)`
`2k + 1 >= 45.01` (since sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01)
`2k >= 44.01`
`k >= 22.005`

So, `k = 22` is the smallest integer satisfying this.

Now, let's find the range for layer 22:

Start: `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`
End: `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`

Wait a minute, 2025 is just before 2026. That means 2026 is actually in the next layer, layer 23.

Let me correct that:

For `k = 22`:
Start: 1850
End: 2025

For `k = 23`:
Start: `(2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`
End: `(2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209`

So, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Structure of the Spiral

Each layer `k` forms a square with side length `2k + 1`. The numbers in the layer are arranged in four segments:

1. Right side: from `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2k - 1)^2 + (2k + 1)`
2. Top side: next `2k` numbers
3. Left side: next `2k` numbers
4. Bottom side: next `2k` numbers

But since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it's at the start of the right side.

### Locating 2026 in the Spiral

Given that 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it's located immediately to the right of the last number of layer 22 (which is 2025).

In the spiral, moving from layer 22 to layer 23 means moving one step to the right from the bottom-right corner of layer 22's square.

Let's think about the coordinates. If we assign coordinates to the numbers where the center (1) is at (0, 0), then:

- Moving right increases the x-coordinate.
- Moving up increases the y-coordinate.
- Moving left decreases the x-coordinate.
- Moving down decreases the y-coordinate.

The bottom-right corner of layer `k` is at `(k, -k)`.

So, the bottom-right corner of layer 22 is at `(22, -22)`, which is the number 2025.

Then, 2026 is at `(23, -22)`.

### Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

The 8 neighbors of a number in the grid are the numbers adjacent to it in all eight possible directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.

Given that 2026 is at `(23, -22)`, its neighbors are at:

1. `(23, -21)` - Above
2. `(23, -23)` - Below
3. `(22, -22)` - Left
4. `(24, -22)` - Right
5. `(22, -21)` - Top-left diagonal
6. `(24, -21)` - Top-right diagonal
7. `(22, -23)` - Bottom-left diagonal
8. `(24, -23)` - Bottom-right diagonal

Now, we need to find out which numbers are at these coordinates.

### Determining Numbers at Neighboring Coordinates

To find the number at a given coordinate `(x, y)`, we can observe the following:

The maximum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` gives the layer number `k` where the number is located.

For example, at `(23, -22)`, max(|23|, |-22|) = 23, so it's in layer 23.

Similarly, let's find the layer for each neighbor:

1. `(23, -21)`: max(23, 21) = 23 → layer 23
2. `(23, -23)`: max(23, 23) = 23 → layer 23
3. `(22, -22)`: max(22, 22) = 22 → layer 22
4. `(24, -22)`: max(24, 22) = 24 → layer 24
5. `(22, -21)`: max(22, 21) = 22 → layer 22
6. `(24, -21)`: max(24, 21) = 24 → layer 24
7. `(22, -23)`: max(22, 23) = 23 → layer 23
8. `(24, -23)`: max(24, 23) = 24 → layer 24

Now, let's find the numbers at these positions.

#### Finding Numbers in Layer 23

Layer 23 starts at 2026 and goes up to 2209.

The numbers in layer 23 are arranged as follows:

- Right side: from `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)` → 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071
- Top side: from `(22, 23)` to `(-23, 23)` → 2072 to 2072 + 45 = 2117
- Left side: from `(-23, 22)` to `(-23, -23)` → 2118 to 2118 + 45 = 2163
- Bottom side: from `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)` → 2164 to 2164 + 45 = 2209

But since we're only interested in the neighbors, let's find the specific numbers:

1. `(23, -21)`: This is on the right side. The right side goes from `(23, -22)` (2026) upwards to `(23, 23)` (2071). Each step up increases the y-coordinate by 1, so the number increases by 1.
   - `(23, -22)`: 2026
   - `(23, -21)`: 2027
2. `(23, -23)`: This is on the bottom side. The bottom side goes from `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)`. The number at `(23, -23)` is the last on the bottom side, which is 2209.
3. `(22, -22)`: This is in layer 22. The bottom-right corner of layer 22 is `(22, -22)`, which is the last number in layer 22, which is 2025.
4. `(24, -22)`: This is in layer 24. The right side of layer 24 starts at `(24, -23)` (since layer 24's bottom-right is `(24, -24)`). Wait, let's think carefully.

Actually, the right side of layer `k` goes from `(k, -(k-1))` to `(k, k)`.

For layer 24:
- Right side: `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`
- `(24, -22)` is the second number on the right side.
- The first number is `(24, -23)`: start of layer 24 is `(2*23 + 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210`
- So, `(24, -23)`: 2210
- `(24, -22)`: 2211
5. `(22, -21)`: This is in layer 22. The top side of layer 22 goes from `(22, 22)` to `(-22, 22)`. The bottom side goes from `(-21, -22)` to `(22, -22)`. The left side goes from `(-22, 21)` to `(-22, -22)`.
   - `(22, -21)` is on the right side of layer 22, which is from `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)`.
   - The right side of layer 22 is from `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)`, which is 2025 - 45 + 1 = 1981 to 2025.
   - `(22, -21)` is the first on the right side: 1981
6. `(24, -21)`: This is in layer 24. The right side is `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`.
   - `(24, -21)` is the third number: 2210 (at -23), 2211 (at -22), 2212 (at -21)
7. `(22, -23)`: This is in layer 23. The bottom side is from `(-22, -23)` to `(23, -23)`.
   - `(22, -23)` is the second number from the start: 2164 (at -22), 2165 (at -21), ..., 2209 (at 23)
   - Wait, the bottom side starts at `(-22, -23)`: 2164
   - Then `(-21, -23)`: 2165
   - ...
   - `(22, -23)`: 2164 + (22 - (-22)) = 2164 + 44 = 2208
   - `(23, -23)`: 2209
   - So, `(22, -23)`: 2208
8. `(24, -23)`: This is in layer 24. The right side starts at `(24, -23)`: 2210

Wait a minute, let me double-check the numbering for `(22, -23)` in layer 23.

Layer 23's bottom side:
Starts at `(-22, -23)`: 2164
Ends at `(23, -23)`: 2209
Total numbers: 23 - (-22) + 1 = 46
But the side length is 46, which matches (from -22 to 23 is 46 steps).

So, `(x, -23)`: number is 2164 + (x - (-22)) = 2164 + x + 22 = 2186 + x
`(22, -23)`: 2186 + 22 = 2208
`(23, -23)`: 2186 + 23 = 2209 (matches)

Similarly, for `(24, -21)` in layer 24:
Right side: `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`: 2210 to 2210 + 46 = 2256
`(24, -21)` is 2210 + (-21 - (-23)) = 2210 + 2 = 2212

### Listing All Neighbors

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors with their numbers:

1. `(23, -21)`: 2027
2. `(23, -23)`: 2209
3. `(22, -22)`: 2025
4. `(24, -22)`: 2211
5. `(22, -21)`: 1981
6. `(24, -21)`: 2212
7. `(22, -23)`: 2208
8. `(24, -23)`: 2210

### Calculating the Sum

Now, let's sum these numbers:

2027 (above)
+ 2209 (below)
+ 2025 (left)
+ 2211 (right)
+ 1981 (top-left)
+ 2212 (top-right)
+ 2208 (bottom-left)
+ 2210 (bottom-right)

Adding them step by step:

2027 + 2209 = 4236
4236 + 2025 = 6261
6261 + 2211 = 8472
8472 + 1981 = 10453
10453 + 2212 = 12665
12665 + 2208 = 14873
14873 + 2210 = 17083

### Verifying the Calculations

Let me quickly verify a couple of these to ensure no mistakes:

- `(23, -21)` is directly above `(23, -22)` (2026), so it should be 2027. Correct.
- `(23, -23)` is at the end of the bottom side of layer 23, which is 2209. Correct.
- `(22, -22)` is the bottom-right corner of layer 22, which is 2025. Correct.
- `(24, -22)` is the second number on the right side of layer 24, which is 2211. Correct.
- `(22, -21)` is the first number on the right side of layer 22, which is 1981. Wait, let's check layer 22's right side.

Layer 22's right side:
Start: `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)`
Number at `(22, -21)`: start of right side is `(2*21 + 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850` to `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
Right side has 45 numbers (from -21 to 22 is 44 steps, but actually from -21 to 22 is 44 positions, but the count is 45 numbers including both ends).
Wait, from `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)` is 22 - (-21) + 1 = 44 numbers, but the side length is 45, which seems off.

Actually, the right side of layer `k` is from `(k, -(k-1))` to `(k, k)`, which is `k - (-(k-1)) + 1 = 2k` numbers.

For layer 22: 2*22 = 44 numbers.

Start: `(22, -21)`: 2025 - 44 + 1 = 1982
Wait, no, the entire layer 22 is from 1850 to 2025, which is 176 numbers (44 per side).

But the right side is the first 44 numbers: 1850 to 1893.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with earlier. Maybe a better approach is to note that the number at `(k, -(k-1))` is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`.

For `(22, -21)`: `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`

Then each step up increases by 1: `(22, -20)`: 1851, ..., `(22, 22)`: 1850 + 43 = 1893.

So, `(22, -21)`: 1850
`(22, -22)`: 1850 + 1 = 1851? Wait, no, `(22, -22)` is the bottom-right corner, which is the last number in layer 22, which is 2025.

This seems conflicting. Maybe the initial assumption about the numbering is incorrect.

Alternative approach: The number at `(x, y)` can be calculated based on the layer and position.

Given that, perhaps it's better to accept that `(22, -21)` is 1981 based on the initial calculation, and proceed.

Given the complexity, and assuming the initial assignments are correct, the sum is 17083.

However, let me cross-validate `(22, -21)`:

Layer 22's right side: `(22, -21)` to `(22, 22)`: 44 numbers.
Start: `(2*21 + 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`
End: `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
But the right side is only part of the layer. The entire layer is 2025 - 1850 + 1 = 176 numbers, which is 4 sides * 44 = 176, so right side is 44 numbers: 1850 to 1893.

So, `(22, -21)`: 1850
`(22, -20)`: 1851
...
`(22, 22)`: 1850 + 43 = 1893

Then `(22, -22)` is the bottom-right corner, which is the last number in layer 22: 2025.

This contradicts the earlier assignment where `(22, -22)` was 2025, which is correct, but `(22, -21)` was assigned 1981, which seems incorrect. It should be 1850.

Similarly, `(22, -23)` is in layer 23, bottom side: starts at `(-22, -23)`: 2164
`(22, -23)` is 2164 + (22 - (-22)) = 2164 + 44 = 2208, which seems correct.

Similarly, `(24, -21)` is in layer 24, right side: starts at `(24, -23)`: 2210
`(24, -21)` is 2210 + 2 = 2212, correct.

So, the incorrect assignment was `(22, -21)`: it should be 1850, not 1981.

Let me correct that:

Original sum was 17083, with `(22, -21)` as 1981. It should be 1850, so the correct sum is 17083 - 1981 + 1850 = 17083 - 131 = 16952.

But let's re-add with the correct value:

2027 (above)
+ 2209 (below)
+ 2025 (left)
+ 2211 (right)
+ 1850 (top-left)
+ 2212 (top-right)
+ 2208 (bottom-left)
+ 2210 (bottom-right)

Adding:

2027 + 2209 = 4236
4236 + 2025 = 6261
6261 + 2211 = 8472
8472 + 1850 = 10322
10322 + 2212 = 12534
12534 + 2208 = 14742
14742 + 2210 = 16952

### Final Answer

After carefully recalculating and correcting the value for `(22, -21)`, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16952**.
