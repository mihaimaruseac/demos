Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand the spiral layout and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral pattern for natural numbers on a square grid:

```
... 5  4  3
... 6  1  2
... 7  8  9
...
```

From this, we can see that the number 1 is at the center. The numbers spiral outward in a counterclockwise direction:

- To the right of 1 is 2.
- Above 2 is 3.
- To the left of 3 is 4.
- Below 4 is 5.
- To the left of 5 is 6.
- Below 6 is 7.
- To the right of 7 is 8.
- Above 8 is 9.
- And so on...

This forms a square spiral where each "layer" or "ring" around the center increases the size of the square.

### Identifying the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. This involves:

1. **Determining the ring (or layer) where 2026 is located.**
   - The center is 1, which is in ring 0.
   - The next ring (ring 1) has numbers from 2 to 9 (8 numbers).
   - Ring 2 has numbers from 10 to 25 (16 numbers).
   - Generally, ring `n` contains numbers from `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`.

   Let's find the ring `k` such that `(2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2`.

   - Calculate `(2k-1)^2` for increasing `k` until it's just less than 2026.
     - k=1: 1 (1 to 9)
     - k=2: 25 (10 to 25)
     - k=3: 81 (26 to 81)
     - k=4: 169 (82 to 169)
     - k=5: 325 (170 to 325)
     - k=6: 577 (326 to 577)
     - k=7: 929 (578 to 929)
     - k=8: 1385 (930 to 1385)
     - k=9: 1945 (1386 to 1945)
     - k=10: 2601 (1946 to 2601)

   2026 is between 1946 and 2601, so it's in ring 10.

   The smallest number in ring 10 is `(2*10 - 1)^2 + 1 = 19^2 + 1 = 361 + 1 = 362`? Wait, no, that doesn't match our earlier calculation.

   Wait, let's correct the formula for the first number in ring `k`:

   The first number in ring `k` is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` for `k >= 1`.

   For `k=10`:
   `(2*10 - 1)^2 + 1 = 19^2 + 1 = 361 + 1 = 362`.

   But from our earlier step, ring 10 starts at 1946, which is `(2*10 - 1)^2 + 1 = 19^2 + 1 = 361 + 1 = 362`? Wait, no, that's incorrect because earlier we saw that ring 9 is up to 1945, so ring 10 starts at 1946.

   Hmm, seems like the formula might be off. Let me re-examine the ring numbering.

   Maybe the center is ring 0, with just 1.
   Ring 1: 2 to 9 (8 numbers)
   Ring 2: 10 to 25 (16 numbers)
   ...
   Ring n: (2n-1)^2 + 1 to (2n+1)^2

   So for ring n, the first number is (2n-1)^2 + 1, and the last is (2n+1)^2.

   Let's find n where (2n-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2n+1)^2.

   Compute (2n+1)^2 until it's >= 2026.

   n=10: (21)^2 = 441
   n=11: 23^2 = 529
   n=12: 25^2 = 625
   n=13: 27^2 = 729
   n=14: 29^2 = 841
   n=15: 31^2 = 961
   n=16: 33^2 = 1089
   n=17: 35^2 = 1225
   n=18: 37^2 = 1369
   n=19: 39^2 = 1521
   n=20: 41^2 = 1681
   n=21: 43^2 = 1849
   n=22: 45^2 = 2025
   n=23: 47^2 = 2209

   So 2026 is between 2025 and 2209, meaning it's in ring 22 (since (2*22 -1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849, and next is 45^2 = 2025).

   Wait, no, the first number in ring n is (2n-1)^2 + 1, last is (2n+1)^2.

   So ring 22: first is (43)^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850, last is 45^2 = 2025.
   But 2026 is after 2025, so it's in ring 23: first is 45^2 + 1 = 2026, last is 47^2 = 2209.

   So 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

   But let's confirm:

   Ring 22: 1850 to 2025 (176 numbers)
   Ring 23: 2026 to 2209 (184 numbers)

   So 2026 is at the start of ring 23.

2. **Determining the side of the square where 2026 is located.**
   Each ring can be thought of as a square with four sides: right, top, left, bottom.

   For ring `n`, the length of each side is `2n` (since the inner square is `(2n-1) x (2n-1)`, and we add one layer around it).

   For ring 23, side length is 46.

   The numbers on each side are:
   - Right side: `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n-1)^2 + 2n`
   - Top side: next `2n` numbers
   - Left side: next `2n` numbers
   - Bottom side: next `2n` numbers

   So for ring 23:
   - First number: 2026
   - Right side: 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071
   - Top side: 2072 to 2072 + 45 = 2117
   - Left side: 2118 to 2118 + 45 = 2163
   - Bottom side: 2164 to 2164 + 45 = 2209

   Since 2026 is the first number in the ring, it's at the start of the right side.

3. **Finding the coordinates of 2026.**
   Let's assign coordinates where the center (1) is at (0,0).

   The right side of ring `n` starts at `(n, -n+1)` and goes up to `(n, n)`.

   For ring 23, the right side starts at (23, -22) and goes to (23, 23).

   The first number on the right side is at (23, -22), which is 2026.

   So, 2026 is at (23, -22).

### Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

The 8 neighbors of a number in the grid are the cells surrounding it, including diagonals. For a cell at (x, y), the neighbors are:

- (x-1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x-1, y+1)
- (x, y-1), (x, y+1)
- (x+1, y-1), (x+1, y), (x+1, y+1)

But since the spiral is constructed in a specific way, we need to ensure that these positions are indeed occupied by numbers in the spiral.

Given that 2026 is at (23, -22), let's find the numbers at these neighboring positions.

First, let's recall how the spiral is built:

- Start at (0,0) with 1.
- Move right to (1,0) for 2.
- Move up to (1,1) for 3.
- Move left to (0,1), (-1,1) for 4,5.
- Move down to (-1,0), (-1,-1) for 6,7.
- Move right to (0,-1), (1,-1), (2,-1) for 8,9,10.
- And so on...

The general pattern is that for a given ring, the numbers increase as we move right, then up, then left, then down.

Given that 2026 is at (23, -22), which is the start of the right side of ring 23, the numbers increase as we move up from (23, -22) to (23, 23).

Therefore, the number immediately above (23, -22) is (23, -21), which is 2027.

Similarly, the number to the left would be (22, -22), but we need to see if this is part of the previous ring.

Wait, let's think differently: the number at (x,y) is part of the spiral, and its neighbors are the numbers at the adjacent positions in the grid, provided those positions are within the spiral's extent.

Given that 2026 is at the start of the right side of ring 23, the positions to its left would be part of ring 22.

But let's find the exact numbers at the neighboring positions.

### Calculating the Numbers at Neighboring Positions

To find the number at a given (x,y), we can use the following approach:

1. Determine the ring `n` where the point (x,y) lies: `n = max(|x|, |y|)`.
2. Determine which side of the ring the point is on:
   - Right side: x = n, -n ≤ y ≤ n
   - Top side: y = n, -n ≤ x ≤ n
   - Left side: x = -n, -n ≤ y ≤ n
   - Bottom side: y = -n, -n ≤ x ≤ n
3. Calculate the number based on the side and position.

Given that, let's find the numbers at the 8 neighboring positions of (23, -22):

1. (22, -23): This is on the bottom side of ring 23 (since y = -23, x = 22).
   - Bottom side of ring 23: starts at (23, -23) with number 2026 + 3*46 = 2026 + 138 = 2164 (since right: 46, top: 46, left: 46, bottom: 46)
   - Wait, no, let's calculate properly.

   The first number in ring 23 is 2026 at (23, -22).
   The right side is (23, -22) to (23, 23): 46 numbers (2026 to 2071).
   Then top side: (22, 23) to (-23, 23): 46 numbers (2072 to 2117).
   Then left side: (-23, 22) to (-23, -23): 46 numbers (2118 to 2163).
   Then bottom side: (-22, -23) to (23, -23): 46 numbers (2164 to 2209).

   So (22, -23) is the second last on the bottom side: 2209 - 1 = 2208.

2. (22, -22): This is on the right side of ring 22.
   - Ring 22: first number is (2*22-1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850 at (22, -21).
   - Right side: (22, -21) to (22, 22): 45 numbers (1850 to 1894).
   - So (22, -22) is 1850 + ( -22 - (-21) ) = 1850 -1 = 1849? Wait, no, (22, -21) is 1850, (22, -20) is 1851, ..., (22, 22) is 1850 + 44 = 1894.
   - (22, -22) is before (22, -21), so it's not in ring 22's right side. Hmm, seems like (22, -22) is not part of ring 22's right side.

   Wait, maybe (22, -22) is on the bottom side of ring 22.
   - Bottom side of ring 22: ( -22, -22 ) to (22, -22): 45 numbers.
   - First is ( -22, -22 ): number is (2*22-1)^2 + 3*45 = 1849 + 135 = 1984.
   - Then ( -21, -22 ) is 1985, ..., (22, -22) is 1984 + 44 = 2028.

   Wait, no, let's calculate properly.

   The first number in ring 22 is 1850 at (22, -21).
   Right side: (22, -21) to (22, 22): 45 numbers (1850 to 1894).
   Top side: (21, 22) to (-22, 22): 45 numbers (1895 to 1939).
   Left side: (-22, 21) to (-22, -22): 45 numbers (1940 to 1984).
   Bottom side: (-21, -22) to (22, -22): 45 numbers (1985 to 2029).

   So (22, -22) is the last on the bottom side: 2029.

3. (22, -21): This is on the right side of ring 22: 1850.

4. (23, -23): This is on the bottom side of ring 23: first is (23, -23): 2164.

5. (23, -21): This is on the right side of ring 23: 2026 + ( -21 - (-22) ) = 2026 + 1 = 2027.

6. (24, -22): This is on the right side of ring 24.
   - First number in ring 24: (2*24-1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210 at (24, -23).
   - Right side: (24, -23) to (24, 24): 48 numbers (2210 to 2257).
   - So (24, -22) is 2210 + ( -22 - (-23) ) = 2210 + 1 = 2211.

7. (24, -23): First on right side of ring 24: 2210.

8. (24, -21): On right side of ring 24: 2210 + ( -21 - (-23) ) = 2210 + 2 = 2212.

Now, let's list all 8 neighbors with their numbers:

1. (22, -23): 2208
2. (22, -22): 2029
3. (22, -21): 1850
4. (23, -23): 2164
5. (23, -21): 2027
6. (24, -22): 2211
7. (24, -23): 2210
8. (24, -21): 2212

### Calculating the Sum of the Neighbors

Now, sum all these numbers:

2208 + 2029 + 1850 + 2164 + 2027 + 2211 + 2210 + 2212

Let's add them step by step:

- 2208 + 2029 = 4237
- 4237 + 1850 = 6087
- 6087 + 2164 = 8251
- 8251 + 2027 = 10278
- 10278 + 2211 = 12489
- 12489 + 2210 = 14699
- 14699 + 2212 = 16911

### Verifying the Calculations

Let me double-check the numbers at each position to ensure no mistakes:

1. (22, -23): Bottom side of ring 23, second last: 2209 - 1 = 2208 ✔
2. (22, -22): Bottom side of ring 22, last: 2029 ✔
3. (22, -21): Right side of ring 22, first: 1850 ✔
4. (23, -23): Bottom side of ring 23, first: 2164 ✔
5. (23, -21): Right side of ring 23, second: 2027 ✔
6. (24, -22): Right side of ring 24, second: 2211 ✔
7. (24, -23): Right side of ring 24, first: 2210 ✔
8. (24, -21): Right side of ring 24, third: 2212 ✔

The sum calculation also checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16911**.
