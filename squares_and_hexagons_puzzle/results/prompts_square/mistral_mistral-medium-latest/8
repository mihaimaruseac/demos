Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand how the numbers are arranged in the spiral and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral layout based on the example provided:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is a small portion of an infinite spiral where natural numbers are arranged in a square grid. The number 1 is at the center, and the numbers increase as we move outward in a counterclockwise spiral.

To better understand, let's expand this spiral a bit more to see how the numbers are arranged around 1:

```
... 17 16 15 14 13
... 18  5  4  3 12
... 19  6  1  2 11
... 20  7  8  9 10
... 21 22 23 ...
```

From this, we can observe the pattern:

- The number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers increase as we move right, then up, then left, then down, and so on, forming concentric squares around the center.

### Identifying the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of a specific number (in this case, 2026), we need to determine its position in the spiral. This involves figuring out which "layer" or "ring" the number is in and its exact coordinates within that ring.

**Layers of the Spiral:**

Each layer can be thought of as a square surrounding the previous layer. The layers can be identified by the odd squares (since the bottom-right corner of each layer is an odd square):

- Layer 0: Just the number 1 (center).
- Layer 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (forming a 3x3 square).
- Layer 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (forming a 5x5 square).
- Layer 3: Numbers 26 to 49 (forming a 7x7 square).
- And so on...

The bottom-right corner of layer `k` is `(2k + 1)^2`. For example:

- Layer 0: (2*0 + 1)^2 = 1
- Layer 1: (2*1 + 1)^2 = 9
- Layer 2: (2*2 + 1)^2 = 25
- Layer 3: (2*3 + 1)^2 = 49
- ...

**Finding the Layer for 2026:**

We need to find the smallest `k` such that `(2k + 1)^2 >= 2026`.

Let's calculate:

- k=22: (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
- k=23: (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209

2025 <= 2026 < 2209, so 2026 is in layer 22 (since the bottom-right corner of layer 22 is 2025, and the next layer starts at 2026).

Wait a minute, this seems a bit confusing. Actually, the bottom-right corner of layer `k` is `(2k + 1)^2`, and the numbers in layer `k` range from `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2k + 1)^2`.

So for layer `k`:

- First number: `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`
- Last number: `(2k + 1)^2`

Let's find `k` such that `(2k - 1)^2 + 1 <= 2026 <= (2k + 1)^2`.

Calculate `(2k - 1)^2` for successive `k`:

- k=22: (2*22 - 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849
  - So layer 22: 1850 to 2025
- k=23: (2*23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
  - So layer 23: 2026 to 2209

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

**Position in the Layer:**

Now, let's determine where 2026 is located within layer 23.

Layer 23 is a square with side length `2*23 + 1 = 47`. The numbers in this layer range from 2026 to 2209, totaling `2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184` numbers.

The numbers in a layer are arranged as follows (starting from the bottom-right corner of the previous layer and moving right):

1. Right side: next `side_length - 1` numbers
2. Top side: next `side_length` numbers
3. Left side: next `side_length` numbers
4. Bottom side: next `side_length` numbers

But since the first number is at the bottom-right corner of the previous layer, the sequence is:

- Move right: `side_length - 1` numbers
- Move up: `side_length` numbers
- Move left: `side_length` numbers
- Move down: `side_length` numbers

But actually, the first number in the layer is one step to the right from the bottom-right corner of the previous layer.

Given that, let's see:

For layer `k`, the side length is `2k + 1`.

The first number in the layer is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`, which is at position `(k, -k)` if we consider the center as `(0,0)` and the first layer starts at `(1,0)`.

But to make it clearer, let's define coordinates where `(0,0)` is the center (number 1), `(1,0)` is 2, `(1,1)` is 3, `(0,1)` is 4, `(-1,1)` is 5, and so on.

Then, the position of the first number in layer `k` is `(k, -k + 1)`.

But this might be getting too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to find the coordinates based on the layer.

**Alternative Approach: Finding Coordinates**

Let's define the center as `(0,0)`. Then:

- Layer 0: `(0,0)` is 1.
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 form a 3x3 square around `(0,0)`.
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 form a 5x5 square, and so on.

The bottom-right corner of layer `k` is at `(k, -k)` with number `(2k + 1)^2`.

The number just before the start of layer `k` is `(2k - 1)^2`, which is at `(k - 1, -k + 1)`.

So, the first number in layer `k` is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`, at `(k, -k + 1)`.

Then, the sequence is:

1. Move right: `(k, -k + 1)` to `(k, k)`: `2k` numbers (from `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2k - 1)^2 + 2k`)
2. Move up: `(k, k)` to `(-k, k)`: `2k + 1` numbers
3. Move left: `(-k, k)` to `(-k, -k)`: `2k + 1` numbers
4. Move down: `(-k, -k)` to `(k, -k)`: `2k + 1` numbers

Total numbers in layer `k`: `8k`.

But actually, the first number is at `(k, -k + 1)`, then right to `(k, k)` is `2k - 1` steps (since from `-k + 1` to `k` is `2k - 1` steps), then up to `(-k, k)` is `2k` steps, left to `(-k, -k)` is `2k` steps, down to `(k, -k)` is `2k` steps, totaling `8k` numbers.

But the first number is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1`, and the last is `(2k + 1)^2`, so total numbers is `(2k + 1)^2 - (2k - 1)^2 = 8k`.

Now, for 2026:

We have `(2k - 1)^2 + 1 <= 2026 <= (2k + 1)^2`.

We found `k=23`:

`(2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`.

So, 2026 is the first number in layer 23, at position `(23, -22)`.

Now, let's find the coordinates of 2026.

The first number in layer 23 is at `(23, -22)`.

But let's verify the position:

The bottom-right corner of layer 22 is at `(22, -22)` with number `45^2 = 2025`.

The next number, 2026, is one step to the right: `(23, -22)`.

Then, the sequence is:

- Right: `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)`: 45 steps (from -22 to 23 is 45 steps)
- Up: `(23, 23)` to `(-23, 23)`: 46 steps
- Left: `(-23, 23)` to `(-23, -23)`: 46 steps
- Down: `(-23, -23)` to `(23, -23)`: 46 steps

Total: 45 + 46 + 46 + 46 = 183, but we have 2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184 numbers, which matches (since the first number is at `(23, -22)` and the last at `(23, -23)`).

But actually, the first number is at `(23, -22)`, then right to `(23, 23)` is 45 steps (from -22 to 23 is 45), then up to `(-23, 23)` is 46, left to `(-23, -23)` is 46, down to `(23, -23)` is 46, totaling 45 + 46 + 46 + 46 = 183, but we have 184 numbers, so the first number is at `(23, -22)`, and the sequence is:

2026: `(23, -22)`
2027: `(23, -21)`
...
2070: `(23, 23)`
2071: `(-22, 23)`
...
2116: `(-23, 23)`
2117: `(-23, 22)`
...
2162: `(-23, -23)`
2163: `(22, -23)`
...
2208: `(23, -23)`
2209: `(24, -23)` (start of next layer)

But we only need up to 2026, which is at `(23, -22)`.

### Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

Now, the 8 neighbors of a number at `(x, y)` are:

`(x-1, y-1)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x-1, y+1)`,
`(x, y-1)`, `(x, y+1)`,
`(x+1, y-1)`, `(x+1, y)`, `(x+1, y+1)`

For 2026 at `(23, -22)`, the neighbors are:

1. `(22, -23)`
2. `(22, -22)`
3. `(22, -21)`
4. `(23, -23)`
5. `(23, -21)`
6. `(24, -23)`
7. `(24, -22)`
8. `(24, -21)`

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

**Finding Numbers at Neighboring Positions:**

To find the number at a given `(x, y)`, we can determine which layer it's in and its position within that layer.

The layer `k` is such that `max(|x|, |y|) = k`.

Let's find the layer for each neighbor:

1. `(22, -23)`: max(22, 23) = 23 → layer 23
   - This is on the bottom side of layer 23, moving left from `(23, -23)` to `(-23, -23)`.
   - `(23, -23)` is the last number in the down movement, which is `(2k + 1)^2 - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208`.
   - Then, moving left: `(22, -23)` is 2208 - 1 = 2207
2. `(22, -22)`: max(22, 22) = 22 → layer 22
   - This is the bottom-right corner of layer 22: `(22, -22)` is `(2k + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
3. `(22, -21)`: max(22, 21) = 22 → layer 22
   - This is on the right side of layer 22, moving up from `(22, -22)` to `(22, 22)`.
   - `(22, -22)` is 2025, so `(22, -21)` is 2025 - 1 = 2024
4. `(23, -23)`: max(23, 23) = 23 → layer 23
   - This is the last number in the down movement: `(2k + 1)^2 - 1 = 2208`
5. `(23, -21)`: max(23, 21) = 23 → layer 23
   - This is on the right side of layer 23, moving up from `(23, -22)` to `(23, 23)`.
   - `(23, -22)` is 2026, so `(23, -21)` is 2026 + 1 = 2027
6. `(24, -23)`: max(24, 23) = 24 → layer 24
   - This is the first number in layer 24, which is `(2k - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210`
7. `(24, -22)`: max(24, 22) = 24 → layer 24
   - This is on the right side of layer 24, moving up from `(24, -23)` to `(24, 24)`.
   - `(24, -23)` is 2210, so `(24, -22)` is 2210 + 1 = 2211
8. `(24, -21)`: max(24, 21) = 24 → layer 24
   - Similarly, `(24, -21)` is 2210 + 2 = 2212

Now, let's list the neighbors with their numbers:

1. `(22, -23)`: 2207
2. `(22, -22)`: 2025
3. `(22, -21)`: 2024
4. `(23, -23)`: 2208
5. `(23, -21)`: 2027
6. `(24, -23)`: 2210
7. `(24, -22)`: 2211
8. `(24, -21)`: 2212

### Calculating the Sum of the Neighbors

Now, sum these numbers:

2207 + 2025 + 2024 + 2208 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Let's add them step by step:

- 2207 + 2025 = 4232
- 4232 + 2024 = 6256
- 6256 + 2208 = 8464
- 8464 + 2027 = 10491
- 10491 + 2210 = 12701
- 12701 + 2211 = 14912
- 14912 + 2212 = 17124

### Verification

Let me verify the positions and numbers to ensure no mistakes:

- `(23, -22)`: 2026 (first in layer 23)
- `(23, -21)`: next in right movement: 2027
- `(22, -21)`: layer 22, right side, moving up from `(22, -22)`=2025: 2024
- `(22, -22)`: 2025 (bottom-right corner of layer 22)
- `(22, -23)`: layer 23, bottom side, moving left from `(23, -23)`=2208: 2207
- `(23, -23)`: 2208 (last in down movement)
- `(24, -23)`: first in layer 24: 2210
- `(24, -22)`: next in right movement: 2211
- `(24, -21)`: next: 2212

The sum seems correct: 17124.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **17124**.
