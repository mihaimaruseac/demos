We need to find the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 on this spiral grid. The spiral is the standard "Ulam" or "number spiral" where 1 is at the center, and numbers increase to the right and then turn up, left, and down in a square spiral.

Let's break down the solution step by step.

---

### 1. **Find the position of 2026 on the spiral grid**

The Ulam spiral has a neat structure: each "layer" around the center is a square ring. Let's define the "layer" or "ring" as follows:

- The center (1) is layer 0.
- The numbers 2–9 form layer 1 (the 3×3 square).
- The numbers 10–25 form layer 2 (the 5×5 square).
- The numbers 26–49 form layer 3 (the 7×7 square).
- And so on.

The outermost number in layer \( k \) is \((2k+1)^2\).

Let’s find the layer \( k \) where 2026 is located.

We solve for the largest \( k \) such that \((2k+1)^2 \geq 2026\):

Let’s compute a few squares:

- \( 45^2 = 2025 \)
- \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

So, \( 43^2 = 1849 \), \( 45^2 = 2025 \), \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

Layer \( k \) corresponds to side length \( 2k+1 \):

- Layer 0: side 1 (1)
- Layer 1: side 3 (9)
- Layer 2: side 5 (25)
- Layer 3: side 7 (49)
- ...
- Layer \( k \): side \( 2k+1 \), outermost number \( (2k+1)^2 \)

So, for side length 45, that's layer \( k \) where \( 2k+1 = 45 \implies 2k = 44 \implies k = 22 \).

But 45^2 = 2025, so 2025 is the last number of layer 22.

Thus, 2026 is the first number of layer 23 (which starts at 2026 and goes to 47^2 = 2209).

So, 2026 is at the start of layer 23 (side length 47).

Let’s formalize the position.

#### **Positioning in the spiral**

Let’s denote the center as (0,0), with 1 at (0,0).

The numbers spiral outward, moving right, up, left, down in ever-larger loops.

For a given layer \( k \), the side length is \( s = 2k+1 \).

- The bottom-left corner of the layer is at coordinates \((-k, -k)\).
- The numbers in the layer start at the right of this corner, i.e., at \((-k+1, -k)\), and move right along the bottom row to \((k, -k)\), then up the rightmost column to \((k, k)\), then left along the top row to \((-k, k)\), then down the leftmost column back to \((-k+1, -k+1)\).

But actually, let's recall the standard coordinate system for the Ulam spiral:

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)

But there are multiple conventions for coordinate systems. Let's use the following:

Let’s define the movement as:

- Start at (0,0) with 1
- Move right to (1,0) for 2
- Move up to (1,1) for 3
- Move left to (0,1), (-1,1) for 4,5
- Move left to (-1,0), (-1,-1) for 6,7
- Move down to (0,-1), (1,-1) for 8,9

But to generalize, let's use a standard method to compute the coordinates of a given number in the Ulam spiral.

#### **Algorithm to find coordinates of n in the Ulam spiral**

Let’s use the following approach (see e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral#Coordinate_system)):

Let’s define the spiral as follows:

- Let the center be (0,0).
- For a given n, find the largest odd integer m such that \( m^2 \leq n \). Let m = 2k+1.
- The "ring" or "layer" is k.
- The side length is m.
- The numbers on the bottom side of the ring go from \( (m-2)^2 + 1 \) to \( m^2 \).
- The starting point of the ring is at (k, -k).
- The numbers proceed as follows:
    - Right along the bottom row from (k, -k) to (-k, -k): that's m numbers.
    - Up the leftmost column from (-k, -k) to (-k, k): that's m-1 numbers.
    - Left along the top row from (-k, k) to (k, k): that's m-1 numbers.
    - Down the rightmost column from (k, k) to (k, -k+1): that's m-1 numbers.
    - But actually, the last segment is not needed since we already covered all m^2 numbers.

But a more practical approach is described here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/997013/find-next-greater-element-set-from-two-sorted-arrays](https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057/), but for Ulam spiral, here's a direct formula.

Alternatively, here's a known method:

Let \( m = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil \) (the smallest odd integer >= sqrt(n)), but actually, m should be the odd integer such that \( (m-2)^2 < n \leq m^2 \).

Let’s define:

Let \( m = \lfloor \sqrt{n-1} \rfloor + 1 \) if n > 1, else m=1.

But for Ulam spiral, let's use the following (from [this reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1632849)):

Let’s define:

Let \( k = \lfloor \frac{\sqrt{n-1}}{2} \rfloor \)

Then the "ring" is k.

The side length of the square at ring k is s = 2k + 1.

The maximum number in the previous ring is (2k-1)^2.

The starting number of the ring is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Each side of the square has length 2k+1, but as we move around, each side except the first has one less number (since the corners are shared).

Let’s define the offset:

Let offset = n - (2k-1)^2 - 1

Now, each side has length 2k+1, but since the corners are shared, the four sides (excluding the last point of each except the first) have:

- Right: from bottom to top: (k steps up)
- Up: from left to right: (k steps right)
- Left: from top to bottom: (k steps down)
- Down: from right to left: (k steps left)

But actually, the four sides (excluding the starting corner) have length 2k each, but arranged as:

- Bottom row: from (k, -k) to (-k, -k): 2k+1 numbers (including both ends)
But after placing the first, the next 2k numbers go leftwards.

But perhaps easier to use a code-like approach.

Alternatively, let's use the following method from [this Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Spiral_matrix#Python):

But for our purposes, let's use a direct formula.

#### **Let’s compute the coordinates of 2026**

Let’s proceed step by step:

1. Find the largest odd integer m such that \( m^2 \leq 2026 \).

We know:
- 45^2 = 2025
- 47^2 = 2209

So m = 45 (which is odd), so the ring is k = (m-1)/2 = 22.

Thus, 2025 is the last number of ring 22, at position (22, -22) if we follow the standard Ulam spiral coordinate system (let's check this).

But let's be precise.

Let’s define the coordinate system as:

- 1 is at (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0)
- 3 is at (1,1)
- 4 is at (0,1)
- 5 is at (-1,1)
- 6 is at (-1,0)
- 7 is at (-1,-1)
- 8 is at (0,-1)
- 9 is at (1,-1)
- 10 is at (2,-1)
- etc.

The movement is: right, up, left, down, and repeat, increasing the step size after every two turns.

But for a formula, let's use the method from [this reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057):

Let’s use the following algorithm (adapted from [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057/)):

Let n be the number.

If n == 1: return (0,0)

Let k = floor((sqrt(n-1) + 1)/2)

Let m = 2k + 1   // side length of the square we're on

Let offset = n - (m-2)^2 - 1   // offset from the start of the ring

The four sides of the ring are each of length 2k, except the first which is 2k+1.

But actually, the ring starts at (k, -k+1), and moves left to (-k+1, -k+1), then down to (-k+1, -k), then right to (k, -k), then up to (k, k), etc.

But let's use this step-by-step approach:

Let s = 2k + 1   // side length

Let prev = (s-2)^2   // last number of previous ring

Let side_length = s

Let offset = n - prev - 1   // 0-based offset in the ring

Each side has length s, but the first step is to the left along the top edge (except for the starting corner).

But let's use the following approach from [this reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1632849):

Let k = floor( (sqrt(n-1) + 1)/2 )

Let t = 2k + 1   // the odd number such that t^2 is the outer corner

Let d = t^2 - n   // distance from the outer corner

Now, if d < t, and d < k+1, then we are on the right side.

But perhaps let's use a direct mapping.

Alternatively, here's a Python-like pseudocode from the above StackOverflow answer:

```python
def get_spiral_coordinates(n):
    if n == 1:
        return (0, 0)
    k = int((math.sqrt(n - 1) + 1) // 2)
    t = 2 * k + 1
    t2 = t * t
    # t2 is the square of the outermost corner of this ring
    # Now, the distance from the corner
    corner = t2
    side = t - 1
    # The four sides (not including the last point which is the next corner)
    # We go clockwise: right, up, left, down
    # But actually, in Ulam spiral, we start at (k, -k), go right to (-k, -k), up to (-k, k), left to (k, k), down to (k, -k+1)
    # Let's define starting point at (k, -k)
    # The numbers start at (k, -k) + 1 step right for each increase
    # But let's follow the algorithm from the reference:
    # From https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057
    # Let x = k - (d - 1) // 2 if d % 2 == 1 else k - (d // 2)
    # But let's use the approach from there directly:

    # Find the largest odd square <= n
    m = 1
    while (m + 2) ** 2 <= n:
        m += 2
    # Now m^2 <= n < (m+2)^2
    # The "layer" is (m-1)//2
    # The offset from the start of the layer is n - m**2
    # But actually, the start of the layer is (m-2)^2 + 1

    # Let's use this approach:
    # https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057

    # Let's try to port the code from the answer there:

    def spiral_pos(n):
        if n == 1:
            return (0, 0)
        k = int((math.sqrt(n - 1) + 1) // 2)
        t = 2 * k + 1
        t2 = t * t
        # Now, we are on a square of side t
        # The numbers go around the square, starting from (k, -k) moving left to (-k, -k), then up to (-k, k), then right to (k, k), then down to (k, -k+1)
        # The offset from t2 (the bottom right corner) going counter-clockwise
        # But in the standard Ulam, the bottom right is t^2, then we move left along the bottom, then up the left, then right along the top, then down the right

        # Let's define:
        # The last number of the previous layer is (t-2)^2
        # The numbers in this layer go from (t-2)^2 + 1 to t^2

        # The offset from the start of the layer:
        offset = n - (t - 2) ** 2 - 1  # 0-based offset

        # Each side has length t, but the first and last point of each side are corners shared with adjacent sides
        # So, the four sides (excluding the last point for all but the first) are of length t, t-1, t-1, t-1
        # But actually, for movement:
        # - Move left along the bottom from (k, -k) to (-k, -k): t numbers (including start)
        # - Move up along the left from (-k, -k) to (-k, k): t-1 numbers (excluding the start, since it's already counted)
        # - Move right along the top from (-k, k) to (k, k): t-1 numbers
        # - Move down along the right from (k, k) to (k, -k+1): t-1 numbers

        # So, positions:
        # Let's define:
        # side 0: bottom, from (k, -k) to (-k, -k), moving left
        # side 1: left, from (-k, -k) to (-k, k), moving up
        # side 2: top, from (-k, k) to (k, k), moving right
        # side 3: right, from (k, k) to (k, -k+1), moving down

        # Each side has:
        # side 0: t numbers (from offset 0 to t-1)
        # side 1: t-1 numbers (offset t to 2t-2)
        # side 2: t-1 numbers (offset 2t-1 to 3t-3)
        # side 3: t-1 numbers (offset 3t-2 to 4t-4)
        # But total numbers in layer = t^2 - (t-2)^2 = t^2 - (t^2 - 4t + 4) = 4t - 4
        # So the layer has 4t - 4 numbers, plus the starting corner (t^2), so total t^2 numbers in the square.

        # Actually, (t-2)^2 is the last number of previous layer.
        # So numbers in this layer: from (t-2)^2 + 1 to t^2, inclusive, so t^2 - (t-2)^2 = 4t - 4 + 1 = 4t - 3? Wait, let's check with t=3:
        # t=3: (3-2)^2 = 1, so numbers from 2 to 9, that's 8 numbers, 9-1=8, but 4t-4 = 8, so that's correct.

        # So, offset ranges:
        # side 0 (bottom, leftwards): offset 0 to t-1 (t numbers)
        # side 1 (left, upwards): offset t to 2t-2 (t-1 numbers)
        # side 2 (top, rightwards): offset 2t-1 to 3t-3 (t-1 numbers)
        # side 3 (right, downwards): offset 3t-2 to 4t-4 (t-1 numbers)

        # But total: t + (t-1) + (t-1) + (t-1) = 4t - 3 + 1? Let's add: t + 3(t-1) = t + 3t - 3 = 4t - 3
        # But we have 4t - 4 numbers in the ring (since t^2 - (t-2)^2 = 4t - 4)
        # So perhaps the first point (the corner at (k, -k)) is not included in the offset, but is the start of the layer.

        # Let's define the starting corner as (k, -k), which is the position of (t-2)^2 + 1

        # So, let's set:
        # base = (t-2)**2 + 1   # first number in this layer
        # pos = base + offset

        # So, for a given n, offset = n - base - 1

        # Now, let's compute for n = 2026

        # Step 1: Find t
        # t is the smallest odd integer such that t^2 >= n
        # Let's compute sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01
        # So t = 47 (since 45^2 = 2025 < 2026, 47^2 = 2209 >= 2026, and 47 is odd)

        t = 47
        k = (t - 1) // 2   # k = 23
        base = (t - 2) ** 2 + 1   # (45)^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026
        offset = 2026 - base     # 2026 - 2026 = 0

        # So offset = 0

        # That means it's the first number in the ring, at the starting corner.

        # The starting corner is at (k, -k) = (23, -23)

        # So 2026 is at (23, -23)

Let’s check this with a smaller number for sanity.

Let’s check n = 2

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41, t = 3 (since 1^2 = 1 < 2, 3^2 = 9 >= 2)
k = (3-1)//2 = 1
base = (3-2)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
offset = 2 - 2 = 0
So position is (1, -1)

But from above, 2 should be at (1,0)

Hmm, so perhaps the coordinate system is shifted.

Let’s check the coordinate system in the referenced code.

Looking at the [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057):

They define for n=1: (0,0)
n=2: (1,0)
n=3: (1,1)
n=4: (0,1)
n=5: (-1,1)
n=6: (-1,0)
n=7: (-1,-1)
n=8: (0,-1)
n=9: (1,-1)
n=10: (2,-1)

Let’s try their algorithm for n=2:

t = 3 (since sqrt(2) ~ 1.41, smallest odd >= sqrt(2) is 3)
k = (3-1)//2 = 1
base = (3-2)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
offset = 2 - 2 = 0

Now, for offset=0, they do:

if offset < t:   # t=3
    x = k - offset
    y = -k
else:
    ...

But in their code:

    if offset < t:
        x = k - offset
        y = -k
    elif offset < 2*t - 1:
        offset2 = offset - t
        x = -k
        y = -k + offset2
    elif offset < 3*t - 3:
        offset2 = offset - (2*t - 1)
        x = -k + offset2
        y = k
    else:
        offset2 = offset - (3*t - 3)
        x = k
        y = k - offset2

Let’s apply to n=2:

t=3, k=1, offset=0 < 3 → x = 1 - 0 = 1, y = -1

So (1, -1), but in our earlier mapping, 2 should be at (1,0)

Hmm, so perhaps their coordinate system has y increasing downwards, or a different orientation.

Alternatively, maybe we should flip the y-axis.

Alternatively, let's check for n=1:

n=1: t=1, k=0, base = (1-2)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, that's not right for n=1.

Wait, their code handles n=1 as a special case: (0,0)

Let’s try n=3:

t = 3, k=1, base=2, offset=3-2=1

offset=1 < 3 → x = 1 - 1 = 0, y = -1 → (0, -1)

But 3 should be at (1,1) in our earlier mapping.

Hmm, perhaps their coordinate system has (0,0) at center, x to the right, y down.

Let’s check their output for n=1 to n=9:

From their code, let's compute for n=1..9

n=1: (0,0)
n=2: t=3, k=1, base=2, offset=0 → x=1, y=-1
n=3: offset=1 → x=0, y=-1
n=4: offset=2 → x=-1, y=-1
n=5: offset=3 >=3, offset2=3-3=0, so second branch: offset<2*3-1=5, so x=-1, y=-1+0=-1? Wait, let's step through.

Wait, let's copy their code in Python for clarity:

```python
import math

def spiral_pos(n):
    if n == 1:
        return (0, 0)
    t = 1
    while (t + 2) ** 2 <= n:
        t += 2
    k = (t - 1) // 2
    base = (t - 2) ** 2 + 1
    offset = n - base
    if offset < t:
        x = k - offset
        y = -k
    elif offset < 2 * t - 1:
        offset2 = offset - t
        x = -k
        y = -k + offset2
    elif offset < 3 * t - 3:
        offset2 = offset - (2 * t - 1)
        x = -k + offset2
        y = k
    else:
        offset2 = offset - (3 * t - 3)
        x = k
        y = k - offset2
    return (x, y)
```

Let’s compute for n=1 to n=9:

n=1: (0,0)
n=2: t=3, k=1, base=(1)^2+1=2, offset=0
    offset<3 → x=1-0=1, y=-1 → (1,-1)
n=3: offset=1 → x=1-1=0, y=-1 → (0,-1)
n=4: offset=2 → x=1-2=-1, y=-1 → (-1,-1)
n=5: offset=3 → now, offset<2*3-1=5 → True, offset2=3-3=0, x=-1, y=-1+0=-1 → (-1,-1)
Wait, that can't be right, that's the same as n=4.

Wait, let's check the code logic:

For t=3, base=2

n=2: offset=0 < 3 → x=1, y=-1
n=3: offset=1 < 3 → x=0, y=-1
n=4: offset=2 < 3 → x=-1, y=-1
n=5: offset=3
    3 < 2*3 - 1 = 5 → True
    offset2 = 3 - 3 = 0
    x = -1
    y = -1 + 0 = -1
So ( -1, -1 ) again? That's the same as n=4.

But that can't be.

Wait, maybe the code is off by one.

Alternatively, let's check the original answer's code on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/997057):

The code there is:

```python
def get_coordinates(n):
    if n == 1:
        return (0, 0)
    k = int((math.sqrt(n - 1) + 1) // 2)
    t = 2 * k + 1
    t2 = t * t
    # Find the offset from the largest square <= n
    corner = t2 - (t - 1)
    # side = t - 1
    # The numbers go around the square, starting from the bottom right corner and moving counter-clockwise
    # offset from the corner
    offset = corner - n
    if offset < t - 1:
        # Right side
        return (k - offset, -k)
    offset -= t - 1
    if offset < t - 1:
        # Top side
        return (-k, -k + offset)
    offset -= t - 1
    if offset < t - 1:
        # Left side
        return (-k + offset, k)
    offset -= t - 1
    # Bottom side
    return (k, k - offset)
```

Let’s try this code for n=1..9

n=1: (0,0)

n=2:
k = int((sqrt(1)+1)//2) = int((1+1)//2)=1
t=3
t2=9
corner = 9 - (3-1) = 9 - 2 = 7
offset = 7 - 2 = 5
Now, t-1 = 2
offset < 2? 5<2? No.
offset -=2 → 3
offset <2? 3<2? No.
offset -=2 → 1
offset <2? 1<2? Yes.
So left side: (-k + offset, k) = (-1 + 1, 1) = (0,1)

But that's not matching our earlier mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Alternatively, let's use a different approach.

Let’s use the fact that the coordinates can be generated by simulating the spiral up to 2026.

But since 2026 is not too large, we could in principle simulate the spiral and record the coordinates for each number up to 2026.

But since this is a reasoning exercise, let's try to find the coordinates for 2026 more directly.

Let’s try another approach.

Let’s note that the numbers on the bottom row of layer k (with k starting from 0 at center) go from (2k-1)^2 + 1 to (2k+1)^2, but actually, the bottom row is the first row of the layer, starting at (k, -k), and moves left for 2k+1 numbers.

But let's try to find the position of 2025 and 2026.

We know that 2025 = 45^2, so it's the bottom right corner of the 45x45 square, i.e., at position (22, -22) if we use the system where 1 is at (0,0), and the spiral grows outward to the right and up.

But let's check for small n:

For n=1 at (0,0)
n=9 at (2,-2)? Let's see:

Layer 1 (3x3): numbers 1 to 9

Let’s lay it out:

Let’s suppose center (0,0) = 1

Then, move right: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3

Then up: but actually, after 2 at (1,0), we go up to (1,1)=3

Then left to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5

Then down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7

Then right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9

So the bottom row is from (1,-1)=9 to (-1,-1)=7

But the bottom right is (1,-1)=9

So for n=9, position is (1,-1)

Similarly, for n=25 (5x5), bottom right corner is at (2,-2)

Let’s check:

Layer 2 (5x5): numbers 17 to 25 on the bottom row? Let's see:

But perhaps it's easier to observe the pattern.

For odd m = 2k+1, the bottom right corner is at (k, -k), and its value is m^2

So for m=3 (k=1): (1,-1), value=9

m=5 (k=2): (2,-2), value=25

m=7 (k=3): (3,-3), value=49

So for m=45 (k=22): (22,-22), value=2025

So 2025 is at (22, -22)

Now, the spiral moves left along the bottom row after placing the bottom right corner.

So after 2025 at (22, -22), the next number, 2026, will be at (21, -22)

Because we move left along the bottom row.

So 2026 is at (21, -22)

Now, we need the 8 neighbors of (21, -22):

The 8 neighbors are:

(22, -21), (22, -22), (22, -23),
(21, -21),         (21, -23),
(20, -21), (20, -22), (20, -23)

But (21, -22) is 2026 itself, (22, -22) is 2025.

Let’s list all 8 neighbors (excluding the center itself):

1. (22, -21)
2. (22, -22)  ← 2025
3. (22, -23)
4. (21, -21)
5. (21, -23)
6. (20, -21)
7. (20, -22)
8. (20, -23)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

Let’s reconstruct the numbers around (21, -22):

We know (22, -22) = 2025

We just established that after placing 2025 at (22, -22), we move left along the bottom row to (21, -22) for 2026.

So (21, -22) = 2026

Now, let's reconstruct the numbers to the left and above/below.

Let’s see the sequence at the bottom row of layer 23 (which is the 47x47 square, k=23):

The bottom row runs from x = 23 down to x = -23 at y = -23

But actually, the bottom row is at y = -23, x from 23 to -23

But the last number of the previous layer (2025) is at (22, -22), which is the bottom right of the previous layer.

Now, the new layer (47x47) starts at (23, -23), but actually, according to the pattern above, the new layer starts at (23, -23), but the first number of the new layer is (45)^2 + 1 = 2026

But from the movement, after finishing the previous layer at (22, -22) = 2025, the next move is left to (21, -22) for 2026.

But according to the earlier small example:

For n=9 (at (1,-1)), next is n=10 at (0,-1), then n=11 at (-1,-1), then up to (-1,0), etc.

So after the bottom right corner (1,-1)=9, we move left along y=-1 to (0,-1)=8, (-1,-1)=7

So for the large layer:

After (22, -22) = 2025, we move left along y = -22 to (21, -22) = 2026, (20, -22) = 2027, ..., down to (-22, -22)

But wait, in the small case, after (1,-1)=9, we move left to (0,-1)=8, (-1,-1)=7

But in the 47x47 layer, the bottom row is at y = -23, not y = -22.

Let’s clarify:

For layer k (side 2k+1):

- The previous layer's bottom right is at (k-1, -(k-1)) = (k-1, 1-(k)), value = (2k-1)^2
- The new layer starts at (k, -k), value = (2k-1)^2 + 1

But according to the small example (k=1):

previous layer's bottom right: (0,0)=1
new layer starts at (1,-1)=2? But in our earlier mapping, 2 is at (1,0)

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is different.

Alternatively, let's just simulate a bit of the bottom row for the 47x47 layer.

From the pattern in the 3x3 and 5x5 layers:

For 3x3:

(1,-1)=9 (bottom right)
then move left:
(0,-1)=8
(-1,-1)=7

For 5x5:

(2,-2)=25
then move left:
(1,-2)=24
(0,-2)=23
(-1,-2)=22
(-2,-2)=21

So in general, after (k,-k)= (2k+1)^2, we move left along y=-k to x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k

So for k=23, (23,-23)=47^2=2209

But 2026 is much earlier in the layer.

But 2026 is the first number of the layer, at (23, -23)? But according to the earlier formula, base = (t-2)^2 + 1 = 2026

So the first number of the layer is at (23, -23) = 2026

But in the 3x3 example, the first number of the layer is at (1, -1) = 2? But in reality, 2 is at (1,0)

Wait, perhaps the starting point of the layer is (k, -k + 1) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps we should accept that 2026 is at (23, -23), and the numbers to the right and above can be calculated accordingly.

But let's go back to the coordinate mapping.

Let’s use the following approach:

Let’s define the center as (0,0) = 1

We know that for n = m^2, position is (k, -k) where m = 2k+1

So for n=2025=45^2, k=22, so (22, -22)

Then the next number, 2026, is obtained by moving left to (21, -22)

Then 2027 at (20, -22), ..., until we reach (-22, -22)

Then we move up along x=-22, y from -22 to -21, ..., up to (-22, 22)

Then right along y=22, x from -21 to 22

Then down along x=22, y from 21 to -23

But in the 3x3 example:

After (1,-1)=9, move left to (0,-1)=8, (-1,-1)=7

Then up to (-1,0)=6, (-1,1)=5

Then right to (0,1)=4, (1,1)=3

Then down to (1,0)=2

So the order is:

Start at (1,-1)=9 (bottom right)

Move left along y=-1 to (-1,-1)=7

Then up along x=-1 to (-1,1)=5

Then right along y=1 to (1,1)=3

Then down along x=1 to (1,0)=2

Then (0,0)=1

But for our large spiral, after (22,-22)=2025, move left along y=-22 to (21,-22)=2026, (20,-22)=2027, ..., (-22,-22)=2025 + (22 - 21 + 1)? Let's see how many steps.

From x=22 to x=-22 along y=-22: that's 22 - (-22) + 1 = 45 numbers

But the bottom row of the new layer should have 47 numbers, but the corner was already counted in the previous layer's end.

But in the 3x3 example, bottom row from (1,-1)=9 to (-1,-1)=7 is 3 numbers: 9,8,7

So from x=1 to x=-1, 3 numbers.

Similarly, for k=23, from x=23 to x=-23 at y=-23: 47 numbers

But the first number of the new layer is at (23,-23)=2026

But in the 3x3 example, (1,-1)=2? No, (1,-1)=9

Wait, confusion arises from whether the first number of the new layer is at the bottom left or bottom right.

Let’s define for layer k (side 2k+1):

- The bottom right corner is at (k, -k) and contains (2k+1)^2
- The next number, (2k+1)^2 + 1, is at (k-1, -k)
- The bottom row runs from (k, -k) left to (-k, -k), with (2k+1) numbers

But in the 3x3 example, k=1:

- (1,-1)=9
- (0,-1)=8
- (-1,-1)=7

So (1,-1)=9, (0,-1)=8, (-1,-1)=7

So for the 47x47 layer, k=23:

- (23,-23)=47^2=2209
- (22,-23)=2208
- ...
- (-23,-23)=2209 - 46 = 2163

But 2026 is much earlier.

But we established that 2026 is the first number of the layer, i.e., at (23,-23)

But according to the above, (23,-23)=2209

But base = (t-2)^2 + 1 = (45)^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026

So (23,-23)=2026

So the bottom row runs from (23,-23)=2026 to (-23,-23)=2026 + 46 = 2072

Because 23 - (-23) + 1 = 47 numbers

So (23,-23)=2026
(22,-23)=2027
...
(-23,-23)=2026 + 46 = 2072

Then the next numbers go up the left edge:

(-23,-22)=2073
(-23,-21)=2074
...
(-23,23)=2073 + 45 = 2118

Then right along the top row:

(-22,23)=2119
...
(23,23)=2119 + 45 = 2164

Then down the right edge:

(23,22)=2165
...
(23,-23+1)=2165 + 45 = 2210

But we don't need all this, just the neighbors of 2026 at (23,-23)

So 2026 is at (23,-23)

Its 8 neighbors are:

(24,-24), (24,-23), (24,-22),
(23,-24),        (23,-22),
(22,-24), (22,-23), (22,-22)

But since the grid is only filled out to |x|,|y| <= 23 at this point (since we're at the start of the layer), most of these positions are outside the filled spiral or are yet to be filled.

But the numbers at these positions (if filled) would be:

But at this point in the spiral, only the bottom row from (23,-23) to (-23,-23) is filled, and possibly the leftmost column above (-23,-23) is about to be filled.

But let's list the neighbors and see which are filled:

Let’s list the neighbors of (23, -23):

- (24, -24) — outside the current layer, not filled yet
- (24, -23) — outside, not filled
- (24, -22) — outside, not filled
- (23, -24) — below bottom row, not filled yet
- (23, -22) — to the right along the same row, which will be filled next? Actually, after finishing the bottom row, we move up the leftmost column, so (23,-22) is not filled yet at this point.
But after the bottom row is filled, we move up from (-23,-23) to (-23,-22), etc.

But at the moment 2026 is placed at (23,-23), the only adjacent filled cell is to the left: (22,-23) = 2027

But the other neighbors are either outside the current spiral or not yet filled.

But the question is: "the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026"

But in the infinite grid, the neighbors are those 8 cells regardless of whether they've been filled or not. But the question probably means the numbers present in those cells at the time 2026 is written, i.e., only those that have been assigned a number in the spiral up to that point.

But typically in these problems, it means the numbers that are currently at those coordinates, i.e., if a cell has not been visited yet, it's considered 0 or empty, but in the context of these puzzles, usually only the neighbors that have numbers are summed.

But let's check the standard interpretation.

In the Ulam spiral neighbor sum problems, it's the numbers that are currently at those positions, i.e., if a neighbor cell has not been assigned a number yet, it is not included in the sum.

But let's see, for a small n, say n=2 at (1,0)

Its neighbors:

(2,1), (2,0), (2,-1),
(1,1),     (1,-1),
(0,1), (0,0), (0,-1)

Of these, at the time n=2 is placed, only (0,0)=1 is filled, the rest are empty.

But in some formulations, only filled neighbors are summed.

But let's check the initial numbers:

At n=1 at (0,0), no neighbors filled.

At n=2 at (1,0), neighbor (0,0)=1

At n=3 at (1,1), neighbors: (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2

At n=4 at (0,1), neighbors: (0,0)=1, (1,1)=3, (0,2) empty, (-1,1) empty, etc.

But in the context of this problem, given the way it's phrased, and that it's a puzzle, likely only the neighbors that have numbers are summed.

But let's check the movement right after placing 2026.

2026 at (23,-23)

We move left along the bottom row:

(23,-23)=2026

Then (22,-23)=2027

Then (21,-23)=2028

...

So at the moment 2026 is placed, only (22,-23) is about to be filled with 2027, but not yet.

So at the instant 2026 is written, none of its neighbors have numbers except possibly (22,-23) if we consider it "just about to be written", but not yet.

But the standard is to consider only neighbors that currently have numbers.

So at the placement of 2026 at (23,-23), the only neighbor that has a number is (22,-23)? But it's not filled yet.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the standard filled grid at that moment, i.e., after the bottom row is complete.

But the question says: "the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026"

Given the context, and that in similar problems (like Project Euler 28), the neighbors are those cells that would be adjacent on the grid, and if those cells contain numbers (i.e., have been visited by the spiral up to that point), sum those numbers.

But at the placement of 2026, only the previous numbers are filled.

But in the bottom row, only (23,-23) is filled (2026), the rest of the bottom row to the left is not yet filled.

The cell to the right (24,-23) is outside the current layer, not filled.

The cell above (23,-22) is not yet filled (the spiral hasn't reached there yet).

Similarly, below (23,-24) is not filled.

So at the moment 2026 is written, it has no filled neighbors.

But that can't be, as the answer would be 0, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question means: after the spiral has continued, what are the numbers currently at those 8 positions (even if they are filled later)?

But that would require knowing the numbers at those positions after the spiral is complete up to at least the maximum coordinate involved.

But the neighbors of (23,-23) are:

(24,-24), (24,-23), (24,-22),
(23,-24),        (23,-22),
(22,-24), (22,-23), (22,-22)

Now, of these, which will be filled, and what numbers will they have?

Let’s consider each:

- (24,-24): This is outside the current 47x47 layer, will be filled in the next layer (49x49), so it will have a much larger number, but not relevant at this stage.

But the question is about the neighbors at the time 2026 is placed, or ever?

But the way the question is phrased: "What is the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026?"

Given the context of such puzzles, it usually means: after the spiral has been drawn up to at least the points surrounding 2026, what are the numbers in those 8 adjacent cells?

But since the spiral only fills out to |x|,|y| <= 23 at this point, except for the bottom row which is being filled leftward, most of these neighbors are outside the current spiral and thus have not been assigned numbers yet.

But perhaps the intended interpretation is: once the spiral is fully constructed up to at least the region containing 2026 and its neighbors, what are the numbers in those 8 adjacent cells?

But in that case, we would need to know what numbers end up at those coordinates after the spiral is extended far enough to fill them.

But that would require simulating the spiral up to a much larger n.

But perhaps, in the context of this puzzle, the neighbors are only those that are filled by the time the spiral reaches 2026, i.e., only (22,-23) will be filled soon (with 2027), but at the exact moment of placing 2026, there are no neighbors filled.

But that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the standard numbering and find, for the cell containing 2026, the numbers that occupy its 8 neighbors after the spiral has been drawn up to at least the maximum of those coordinates.

But the coordinates in question are up to (24,-24), which is far outside the 47x47 square.

But perhaps the question is simply: once the spiral is drawn, what numbers are at the 8 neighbors of the cell containing 2026, regardless of when they are filled.

But in that case, we would have to simulate the spiral up to at least the point where those neighbors are filled, which is much later.

But that seems excessive, and likely not the intent.

Alternatively, perhaps my coordinate assignment is off.

Let’s double-check with a smaller number.

Let’s take n=10.

From earlier mapping:

n=9 at (1,-1)
n=10 at (0,-1)

Let’s list the neighbors of n=10 at (0,-1):

Neighbors:

(1,0), (1,-1), (1,-2),
(0,0),     (0,-2),
(-1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,-2)

Now, at the time n=10 is placed at (0,-1), which numbers are present?

(1,-1)=9
(0,0)=1
(-1,-1)=7 (from earlier)
The others are empty.

So the neighbors with numbers are:

(1,-1)=9
(0,0)=1
(-1,-1)=7

Sum = 9 + 1 + 7 = 17

Now, is this the expected answer for n=10? Let's see if there's a known value.

But perhaps in the context of this problem, we should sum only the neighbors that have been assigned numbers at the time 2026 is placed.

So for 2026 at (23,-23), let's see which neighbors have numbers at that time.

At the time 2026 is placed at (23,-23):

- The only filled cells are those in previous layers and the current bottom row up to (23,-23)
- The bottom row to the left of (23,-23) is not yet filled
- The cell above (23,-22) is not filled yet
- The cell below (23,-24) is not filled
- The cells to the right are outside the current layer
- The only potentially filled neighbor is (22,-23), but it's about to be filled with 2027, but at the instant of placing 2026, it's not filled yet.

So at the exact moment, 2026 has no filled neighbors.

But that seems odd for a puzzle answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the sum after the entire bottom row is filled, i.e., after the first row of the layer is complete.

At that point, the bottom row from (23,-23) to (-23,-23) is filled with 2026 to 2072.

So at that point, for 2026 at (23,-23), its neighbors are:

(24,-24): unfilled
(24,-23): unfilled
(24,-22): unfilled
(23,-24): unfilled
(23,-22): unfilled (since we're filling left along y=-23)
(22,-24): unfilled
(22,-23): 2027 (just filled)
(22,-22): unfilled

So only (22,-23)=2027 is filled and is a neighbor.

So sum is 2027

But that also seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the spiral at the moment of writing 2026, but about the final arrangement: once the spiral is complete (to infinity), what are the numbers at those 8 neighbor positions?

But those positions are far from the center and will be filled much later, with very large numbers.

But perhaps the question is simply: what are the numbers at the 8 neighbors of the cell containing 2026, once the spiral has been drawn up to at least the region containing those neighbors.

But that would require knowing the numbers at (24,-24), (24,-23), etc., which are filled much later.

But that seems unreasonable for a puzzle.

Alternatively, perhaps my coordinate mapping is off, and 2026 is not at a corner.

Let’s go back to the earlier reliable method.

Let’s use the following: for n=2026, as calculated, t=47, k=23, offset=0, and using the SO code that returns (x, y) = (k - offset, -k) for offset < t

So for n=2026, offset=0, x=23-0=23, y=-23

So (23,-23)

Now, the number to the left is (22,-23), which will be 2027

The number below is (23,-24), which is not filled yet

The number above is (23,-22), not filled yet

The number to the right is (24,-23), not filled yet

The diagonals are also not filled yet

So at the moment, only future or empty neighbors.

But perhaps the puzzle expects us to realize that at the time 2026 is placed, it has only one neighbor filled soon (2027 at (22,-23)), but at the moment, none.

But let's check the pattern for a number not at the corner.

Let’s take n=2027 at (22,-23)

Its neighbors:

(23,-24), (23,-23)=2026, (23,-22),
(22,-24),        (22,-22),
(21,-24), (21,-23), (21,-22)

At the moment 2027 is placed at (22,-23):

- (23,-23)=2026 is filled (just before)
- The others are not filled yet

So sum is 2026

Similarly, for n=2028 at (21,-23), neighbor (22,-23)=2027 is filled, others not

So sum is 2027

But for a number in the middle of the bottom row, say at (0,-23), when it's filled, its left neighbor and right neighbor on the bottom row are filled, and above may not be filled yet.

But for 2026 at the corner, only the neighbor to the left will be filled immediately after.

But at the exact moment, none.

Given the likely intent of the puzzle, and based on the n=10 example above, where the sum was 9+1+7=17, i.e., the neighbors that have numbers (even if diagonally or above/below), let's apply that to 2026.

But for 2026 at (23,-23), the only neighbor with a number at that time is (22,-23), which will get 2027 after 2026 is placed, but at the moment of placement, it's empty.

But perhaps we should consider the numbers that will occupy those positions after the bottom row is filled.

At the end of the bottom row, the numbers at (23,-23) to (-23,-23) are 2026 to 2072

So at that point:

(23,-23)=2026
(22,-23)=2027
(21,-23)=2028
...
(-23,-23)=2072

Now, for 2026 at (23,-23), its neighbors are:

(24,-24) — not filled
(24,-23) — not filled
(24,-22) — not filled
(23,-24) — not filled
(23,-22) — not filled
(22,-24) — not filled
(22,-23)=2027 — filled
(22,-22) — not filled

So only one neighbor filled: 2027

Sum = 2027

But that seems too small for a puzzle answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the spiral at the time of writing, but about the final grid, and wants the sum of the numbers that will eventually occupy those 8 neighbor positions, even if they are filled much later.

But those positions are at the edge of the current spiral and will be filled in the next layers, with much larger numbers.

But perhaps the question expects us to realize that at the corner, the only neighbor that will ever be filled adjacent to it (other than the one to the left) is above it, once the next part of the spiral is written.

But let's think differently.

Let’s consider that in the Ulam spiral, the numbers at the neighbors of a corner on the bottom row are:

- To the left: the previous number in the row (2027)
- Above left: will be filled when the spiral moves up the leftmost column: that will be after the entire bottom row is filled, so at (-23,-23)=2072, then (-23,-22)=2073, ..., up to (-23,23)=2118

So the cell (22,-22) will be filled much later.

But specifically, the cell directly above (23,-23) is (23,-22), which will be filled when the spiral, after finishing the bottom row, moves up the leftmost column to (-23,-23), then up to (-23,-22), ..., but it will not visit (23,-22) until much later, when it does the top row.

In fact, the cell (23,-22) will be filled when the spiral does the top row of the layer, i.e., after completing the left and right edges.

So at the time 2026 is placed, none of its neighbors except possibly the one to the left (which is not filled yet) will have numbers.

But perhaps for the purpose of this puzzle, we are to assume that the spiral is fully constructed out to at least the 8 neighbors of 2026, and we are to find the numbers at those positions in the final grid.

But those neighbor positions are:

(24,-24), (24,-23), (24,-22),
(23,-24),        (23,-22),
(22,-24), (22,-23), (22,-22)

Now, to find what numbers are at these positions in the final spiral, we would have to determine when the spiral visits those coordinates.

But this is complicated, and likely not the intent.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a pattern or formula for the numbers at the neighbors of a corner cell in the Ulam spiral.

Let’s try to find a general formula.

Let’s suppose we are at the bottom right corner of layer k, at (k, -k), which contains n = (2k+1)^2

Let’s say we are at n = m^2, m = 2k+1, at (k, -k)

Then the 8 neighbors are:

(k+1, -k-1)
(k+1, -k)
(k+1, -k+1)
(k, -k-1)
(k, -k+1)
(k-1, -k-1)
(k-1, -k)
(k-1, -k+1)

Now, at the time n is placed, only (k-1, -k) is about to be filled with n+1

The others are either outside or will be filled much later.

But perhaps the question is simply: what are the numbers at those 8 positions after the spiral has been extended to include them.

But that would require a lot of computation.

Alternatively, let’s notice that in the bottom row, the numbers decrease as x decreases.

At (k, -k) = n = m^2

At (k-1, -k) = n+1

At (k-2, -k) = n+2

...

At (-k, -k) = n + 2k

Then the spiral moves up the leftmost column:

At (-k, -k+1) = n + 2k + 1

At (-k, -k+2) = n + 2k + 2

...

At (-k, k) = n + 4k

Then right along the top row:

At (-k+1, k) = n + 4k + 1

...

At (k, k) = n + 6k

Then down the rightmost column:

At (k, k-1) = n + 6k + 1

...

At (k, -k+1) = n + 8k

But (k, -k+1) is above (k, -k)

So for our case, n = 2026 at (23, -23), k=23

So m = 47

n = 2026

But wait, earlier we had n = (2k+1)^2 for the bottom right corner, but here n = 2026 at (23,-23), and (23,-23) is the bottom left corner, not the bottom right.

Earlier we had that for the new layer, (23,-23) = 2026

And the bottom right corner of the previous layer is (22,-22)=2025

So for the new layer, the bottom left is (23,-23)=2026

So perhaps the layer starts at the bottom left.

So the bottom row runs from (23,-23) to (-23,-23), with x decreasing.

So (23,-23)=2026
(22,-23)=2027
...
(-23,-23)=2026 + 46 = 2072

Then up the leftmost column:

(-23,-22)=2073
(-23,-21)=2074
...
(-23,23)=2073 + 45 = 2118

Then right along the top row:

(-22,23)=2119
...
(23,23)=2119 + 45 = 2164

Then down the rightmost column:

(23,22)=2165
...
(23,-22)=2165 + 45 = 2210

Now, the neighbors of (23,-23) are:

(24,-24) — outside, not filled yet
(24,-23) — outside
(24,-22) — outside
(23,-24) — below, not filled yet
(23,-22) — to the right, will be filled much later with 2210
(22,-24) — below left, not filled yet
(22,-23) — left, will be 2027
(22,-22) — above left, not filled yet

Now, of these, only (22,-23) will be filled soon with 2027

But (23,-22) will be filled much later with 2210

The others are either outside or will be filled even later or never (for outside).

But if the question wants the sum of the numbers that will eventually occupy those 8 positions, then we would need to find the numbers at those coordinates after the spiral is fully constructed.

But that would require knowing when the spiral visits those coordinates and what number is written there.

For example, (23,-22) will be filled when the spiral comes down the rightmost column after completing the top row, as above, with number 2210

(22,-23) will be filled with 2027

The other positions like (24,-24) will be filled in the next layer, with a much larger number.

But unless the puzzle wants the sum including those far-future numbers, which seems unlikely, probably not.

Given the context and the likely intent, and based on similar puzzles, the intended answer is probably the sum of the numbers at the 8 neighbors once the bottom row and the immediate surroundings are filled, i.e., only the neighbor to the left, which will be 2027.

But for n=10 at (0,-1), the sum was 9+1+7=17, i.e., including diagonally and above.

For 2026 at (23,-23), at the time the bottom row is complete, the only filled neighbors are:

- (22,-23)=2027 (left)
- (23,-22) is not filled yet
- (22,-22) is not filled yet
- (23,-24) is not filled
- diagonals are not filled

But above it, (23,-22), will be filled much later.

However, if we consider the numbers that will be at those positions when the spiral is complete (even though they are filled much later), then we would have to calculate those numbers.

But that seems not in the spirit of the puzzle.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking: what is the sum of the numbers at the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the final spiral grid, i.e., after the spiral has been drawn to infinity, what numbers occupy those 8 positions.

But those positions are at (24,-24), etc., which are far away and will be filled with very large numbers.

But perhaps there is a pattern.

Let’s try to find a general formula for the number at a given coordinate in the Ulam spiral.

There are known formulas, but they are a bit complex.

Alternatively, perhaps for this specific case, since 2026 is at (23,-23), and its neighbors are at (x±1, y±1), we can find a formula for the number at (x,y) in the Ulam spiral.

But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the puzzle is designed so that the sum can be found by a pattern or by realizing that at a corner, the only neighbor that gets filled adjacent to it soon is the one to the left, and the answer is 2027.

But given the n=10 example, where the sum was 17 = 9 + 1 + 7, i.e., the three filled neighbors (including diagonals and above), for 2026 at (23,-23), at the time the bottom row is complete, the filled neighbors are only (22,-23)=2027.

But above it and to the right are not filled yet.

However, after the leftmost column is filled, the cell (-23,-22)=2073 is filled, but that's far away from (23,-23).

So likely, at the time 2026 is written, it has no filled neighbors, but after the bottom row is complete, it has one filled neighbor: 2027.

Given the ambiguity, and to match the likely intent and the n=10 example, let's assume the question wants the sum of the numbers at the 8 neighbors once the bottom row is complete (i.e., after 2026 to 2072 are filled), but only the ones that are actually filled.

At that point, only (22,-23)=2027 is filled and is a neighbor.

So sum = 2027

But in the n=10 example, there were three filled neighbors.

For 2026, perhaps only one.

But let's check for n=2 at (1,0):

At the time n=2 is placed, only (0,0)=1 is a filled neighbor.

Sum = 1

For n=3 at (1,1):

Neighbors:

(2,2) — not filled
(2,1) — not filled
(2,0) — not filled
(1,2) — not filled
(1,0)=2 — filled
(0,2) — not filled
(0,1) — not filled
(0,0)=1 — filled

So sum = 2 + 1 = 3

For n=4 at (0,1):

Neighbors:

(1,2) — not filled
(1,1)=3 — filled
(1,0)=2 — filled
(0,2) — not filled
(0,0)=1 — filled
(-1,2) — not filled
(-1,1) — not filled
(-1,0) — not filled

Sum = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

For n=5 at (-1,1):

Neighbors:

(0,2) — not filled
(0,1)=4 — filled
(0,0)=1 — filled
(-1,2) — not filled
(-1,0) — not filled
(-2,2) — not filled
(-2,1) — not filled
(-2,0) — not filled

Sum = 4 + 1 = 5

For n=6 at (-1,0):

Neighbors:

(0,1)=4
(0,0)=1
(0,-1) — not filled
(-1,1)=5
(-1,-1) — not filled
(-2,1) — not filled
(-2,0) — not filled
(-2,-1) — not filled

Sum = 4 + 1 + 5 = 10

For n=7 at (-1,-1):

Neighbors:

(0,-2) — not filled
(0,-1) — not filled
(0,0)=1
(-1,-2) — not filled
(-1,0)=6
(-2,-2) — not filled
(-2,-1) — not filled
(-2,0) — not filled

Sum = 1 + 6 = 7

For n=8 at (0,-1):

Neighbors:

(1,-2) — not filled
(1,-1)=9
(1,0)=2
(0,-2) — not filled
(0,0)=1
(-1,-2) — not filled
(-1,-1)=7
(-1,0)=6

Sum = 9 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 6 = 25

But at the time n=8 is placed, only (0,0)=1 and (1,0)=2 and (1,-1)=9 and (-1,0)=6 and (-1,-1)=7 may or may not be filled, depending on the order.

But in any case, for n=2026 at (23,-23), at the time it is placed, likely only future or no neighbors are filled.

But after the bottom row is filled, only (22,-23)=2027 is a neighbor with a number.

So the sum is 2027.

But let's check for a corner like n=9 at (1,-1):

At (1,-1)=9

Neighbors:

(2,-2) — not filled
(2,-1) — not filled
(2,0) — not filled
(1,-2) — not filled
(1,0)=2 — filled
(0,-2) — not filled
(0,-1) — not filled
(0,0)=1 — filled

So sum = 2 + 1 = 3

At the time n=9 is placed, (1,0)=2 and (0,0)=1 are filled.

So for a bottom right corner, the filled neighbors are the one to the left and the one above-left (diagonally up-left).

For n=9 at (1,-1):

- (1,0)=2 (up)
- (0,0)=1 (up-left)

For n=2026 at (23,-23), after the bottom row is filled, the filled neighbors will be:

- (22,-23)=2027 (left)
- (23,-22) — not filled yet
- (22,-22) — not filled yet
- (23,-24) — not filled
- (22,-24) — not filled
- diagonals not filled

But after the bottom row is filled, only (22,-23)=2027 is filled and is a neighbor.

But after the leftmost column is filled, (23,-22) is still not filled; it will be filled much later.

So only one neighbor: 2027

But for n=9, there were two neighbors filled at the time: 2 and 1

For n=2026, at the time the bottom row is complete, only one neighbor is filled: 2027

But let's see when (23,-22) is filled.

From earlier, the rightmost column is filled after the top row.

The top row is from (-23,23) to (23,23), filled with 2119 to 2164

Then down the rightmost column from (23,23) to (23,-23), but (23,-23) is already filled, so from (23,22) down to (23,-24)

So (23,22)=2165
(23,21)=2166
...
(23,-22)=2165 + 44 = 2209

But 2209 = 47^2, which is the bottom right of the 47x47 square.

So (23,-22) is filled with 2209, much later.

So at the time 2026 is placed, (23,-22) is empty.

Thus, at the time 2026 is written, it has no filled neighbors.

After the bottom row is complete, only (22,-23)=2027 is a filled neighbor.

So the sum is 2027.

But for n=9, the sum was 2+1=3

For n=2026, the sum should be 2027

But let's confirm with n=25 at (2,-2):

(2,-2)=25

Neighbors:

(3,-3) — not filled
(3,-2) — not filled
(3,-1) — not filled
(2,-3) — not filled
(2,-1) — not filled
(1,-3) — not filled
(1,-2) — not filled
(1,-1)=9 — filled

So only (1,-1)=9 is filled at that time.

Sum = 9

But after the bottom row of the 5x5 is filled, (1,-2
