The problem asks for the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a Ulam spiral (or similar square spiral).

First, we need to determine the layer or "ring" in which the number 2026 lies. In a square spiral, the largest number in the $n$-th ring (starting with the center 1 as ring 0) is $(2n+1)^2$.

We look for the smallest integer $n$ such that $(2n+1)^2 \ge 2026$.
We calculate the squares of odd numbers:
$41^2 = 1681$
$43^2 = 1849$
$45^2 = 2025$
$47^2 = 2209$

Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2025 is the corner of the $n$-th ring where $2n+1 = 45$, so $2n = 44$, and $n = 22$.

The number 2026 is in the next layer, the $(n+1)$-th layer, which is ring 23.
The largest number in ring 23 is $47^2 = 2209$.

The $n$-th ring (starting from $n=1$ for the ring containing 2, 3, ..., 9) has side length $2n+1$. The largest number in this ring is $(2n+1)^2$.
For $n=22$, the ring ends at $45^2 = 2025$.

The structure of the spiral shows that the number $(2n-1)^2$ is the bottom-right corner of the $(n-1)$-th ring, and $(2n+1)^2$ is the top-right corner of the $n$-th ring.

The ring containing 2026 is the one whose outermost square has side length $S = 47$. This corresponds to $2n+1 = 47$, so $n=23$.
The largest number in this ring is $47^2 = 2209$.
The previous ring ended at $45^2 = 2025$.

The number 2025 is the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square (the end of the $n=22$ layer). In the standard Ulam spiral (starting from 1 at the center and moving right first):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top-Right corner: $(2n+1)^2$
    \item Top-Left corner: $(2n+1)^2 - (2n)$
    \item Bottom-Left corner: $(2n+1)^2 - 2(2n)$
    \item Bottom-Right corner: $(2n+1)^2 - 3(2n)$ (This is WRONG for the standard construction where movement is Right $\to$ Up $\to$ Left $\to$ Down)
\end{itemize}

Let's re-examine the corners for the square ending at $M = (2n+1)^2$. The side length is $S = 2n$.
Starting from $M$ and moving counter-clockwise (as per the spiral $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to \dots$):
1. $M = (2n+1)^2$ is the TR corner.
2. Move Left $S$ steps: TL corner is $M - S$.
3. Move Down $S$ steps: BL corner is $M - 2S$.
4. Move Right $S$ steps: BR corner is $M - 3S$.
5. Move Up $S-1$ steps to reach $(2n-1)^2$.

For $n=23$, the largest number is $47^2 = 2209$. Here $2n=46$.
TR corner: $2209$.
TL corner: $2209 - 46 = 2163$.
BL corner: $2163 - 46 = 2117$.
BR corner: $2117 - 46 = 2071$.

This is the ring containing numbers from $45^2 + 1 = 2026$ up to $47^2 = 2209$.
The previous square ended at $45^2 = 2025$, which is the BR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square (where $2n'=44$).

The number 2026 is $2025 + 1$. The number 2025 is the bottom-right corner of the previous ring. The next number, 2026, starts moving up along the right edge of the new ring.

The right edge of the ring defined by $47^2$ goes from $2071$ (BR corner) up to $2209$ (TR corner).
Wait, the number 2025 is the *end* of the $45 \times 45$ square. Let's trace the path near 2025:
The $45 \times 45$ square ends at $2025$. This corner is the point where the spiral turns left after completing the bottom edge. (BR corner if we trace backwards from $47^2$).

Let $S_k = (2k+1)^2$.
$S_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$. This number is the corner where the spiral completes the bottom edge and moves one step up to start the new ring.

If we follow the standard Ulam spiral (Right, Up, Left, Down):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Center: 1 (R)
    \item 2 (U)
    \item 3 (L) $\to$ 4 (L)
    \item 5 (D) $\to$ 6 (D) $\to$ 7 (D)
    \item 8 (R) $\to$ 9 (R) $\to$ 10 (R) $\to$ 11 (R)
\end{enumerate}
The corners for $R=2n$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n=1$ (Side 3): $9 = (2\cdot 1+1)^2$. TR corner.
    \item $n=2$ (Side 5): $25 = (2\cdot 2+1)^2$. TR corner.
\end{itemize}
If $N = (2n+1)^2$, $N$ is the Top-Right corner.
$N=2025$ corresponds to $2n+1 = 45$, so $n=22$. $2n=44$. $N=2025$ is the TR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.

The path around 2025 (TR corner of $45 \times 45$ square):
\begin{itemize}
    \item TR: 2025
    \item Left edge (44 steps): $2025 - 44 = 1981$ (TL corner)
    \item Bottom edge (44 steps): $1981 - 44 = 1937$ (BL corner)
    \item Right edge (44 steps): $1937 - 44 = 1893$ (BR corner)
\end{itemize}
The next number is $1893 + 1 = 1894$. This is the start of the segment moving up to $45^2$. Wait, this is not consistent with the diagram provided in the prompt, which shows the movement direction changes around the number 1.

Let's analyze the provided snippet:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

1 is the center.
1 $\to$ 2 (Right)
2 $\to$ 3 (Up)
3 $\to$ 4 (Left)
4 $\to$ 5 (Left)
5 $\to$ 6 (Down)
6 $\to$ 7 (Down)
7 $\to$ 8 (Right)
8 $\to$ 9 (Right)
9 $\to$ 10 (Right, off the snippet)

This is a standard counter-clockwise spiral starting by moving Right.

For $n \ge 1$, the largest number in the $n$-th square is $M_n = (2n+1)^2$. This number is the Top-Right (TR) corner.
The side length of the movement is $S_n = 2n$.

For $n=22$, $2n=44$. $M_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$. This is the TR corner.
The numbers in the outermost layer are from $2025$ down to $(2\cdot 21+1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.

The sequence of corners for the $n=22$ square (ending at 2025):
\begin{itemize}
    \item TR: $2025$
    \item TL: $2025 - 44 = 1981$
    \item BL: $1981 - 44 = 1937$
    \item BR: $1937 - 44 = 1893$
\end{itemize}
The next number is $1893 + 1 = 1894$. This number is one step up from the BR corner, starting the next square's right edge, moving towards $47^2$.

The number 2026 belongs to the next layer, $n=23$. The side length of movement is $S_{23} = 2 \cdot 23 = 46$.
The numbers in this layer start from $1894$ (if we follow the $45^2$ structure, which is complicated) or $2025+1$.

Since $2025$ is the TR corner, the path continues by moving Up (Length 44) from $2025-44=1981$ (TL), Left (Length 44) to $1937$ (BL), Down (Length 44) to $1893$ (BR).
Wait, if $2025$ is TR, the spiral must be moving Left from 2025.

Let's trace the path *after* $43^2 = 1849$ (which must be a corner from the $n=21$ square).
$n=22$: side length $44$. Starts after $1849$.
The number $1850$ is 1 step to the Right of $1849$.

If $M = (2n-1)^2$, the path after $M$ is:
1. R (1 step) $\to (2n)^2 - 2n + 1$. (This is $43^2 + 1 = 1850$)
2. U ($2n-1$ steps)
3. L ($2n$ steps)
4. D ($2n$ steps)
5. R ($2n$ steps) $\to (2n+1)^2$ (TR Corner)

For $n=22$: $2n=44$. $M=43^2 = 1849$.
1. R (1 step): 1850. (This is one step right of $43^2$)
2. U (43 steps): Ends at $1850 + 43 = 1893$. (This should be the TL corner?)
3. L (44 steps): Ends at $1893 + 44 = 1937$. (BL corner)
4. D (44 steps): Ends at $1937 + 44 = 1981$. (BR corner)
5. R (44 steps): Ends at $1981 + 44 = 2025 = 45^2$. (TR corner)

The number 2026 is the next step: Right 1 step from 2025, or the start of the new side length $46$.
Since 2025 is TR, the spiral turns Up to start the next ring ($n=23$, side length $46$).
The path continues:
$2025 \to 2026$ (Up)
This means 2026 is on the Right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.

The Right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square runs from $2071$ (BR) to $2209$ (TR).
The right edge movement starts after $45^2 = 2025$.
The path continues Up from 2025 for $46$ steps to reach $47^2 = 2209$.
$2025 + 46 = 2071$. This must be the Top-Left corner of the next ring if the TR corner is 2209. This is confusing.

Let's use the position relative to the corners of the $47^2=2209$ square ($n=23$, side $S=46$).
If 2209 is TR:
TL: $2209 - 46 = 2163$
BL: $2163 - 46 = 2117$
BR: $2117 - 46 = 2071$

The path moves counter-clockwise: TR $\to$ TL (Left) $\to$ BL (Down) $\to$ BR (Right) $\to$ TR (Up).

The numbers are increasing as we move away from the center.
The segment ending at 2209 (TR) must be the Up segment coming from the BR corner of the previous side, or the Right segment coming from the previous TR corner.

If 2025 is the end of the previous path (TR of $45^2$), the path continues UP:
$2025 \to 2026$ (Up).
2026 is on the Right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square. This Right edge goes from $2071$ (BR) to $2209$ (TR).
If the spiral is moving counter-clockwise (Right $\to$ Up $\to$ Left $\to$ Down $\to$ Right...):

The sequence of numbers moving UP the right side:
$C_{TR} = 2209$ (TR corner)
$C_{BR} = 2071$ (BR corner)

The right edge runs from BR to TR, so the numbers increase as we go UP.
The length of this edge is $S=46$.
The segment of the right edge for the $47 \times 47$ square starts at $2025 + 1$ and ends at $2209$.
$2025$ is the end of the previous path. The path turns UP.

The numbers on the right edge are: $2026, 2027, \dots, 2209$.
The number of steps along this edge is $2209 - 2025 = 184$. This is not $46$.

The $47 \times 47$ square has 4 sides of length 46. Total numbers added: $4 \times 46 = 184$.
$2209 - 2025 = 184$. This confirms that the numbers $2026, 2027, \dots, 2209$ form the boundary of the $47 \times 47$ square, starting right after $45^2 = 2025$.

The path of the $47 \times 47$ boundary (starting from $2026$):
1. **Up** (Right edge): Moves from the position after $2025$ up towards $2209$.
The structure of the spiral means that $2025$ must be the corner where the spiral turns UP to start the next layer. This corner is the **Bottom-Right** corner of the $47 \times 47$ square's boundary path.

If 2209 is TR, and the spiral moves CCW (Right $\to$ Up $\to$ Left $\to$ Down):
The path segment ending at 2209 (TR) must be the UP move.
The segment starting at 2026 must be the RIGHT move from the previous TR ($45^2$).

If $2025$ is TR ($45^2$): The spiral moves UP from $2025$ to start the next square.
The next square ($47^2=2209$) has sides of length $46$.
The segment of length 46 starting from $2025+1$ must be the UP segment, leading to the TR corner $2209$.

$2025 + 46 = 2071$. This should be the TR corner if the path was $2025 \to \dots \to 2071$. But $2209$ is the TR corner.

Let's re-establish the position of $2025$ relative to the $47 \times 47$ square ($S=46$).
The numbers $2026, \dots, 2209$ are on the boundary.
$2209$ is TR. $2071$ is BR.
The right edge is $2071 \to 2209$ (46 steps, moving Up).
The top edge is $2163 \to 2209$ (46 steps, moving Right). Wait, TR is the end of the UP segment and the start of the LEFT segment.

Standard CCW spiral (R $\to$ U $\to$ L $\to$ D):
TR corner is reached via UP segment.
TL corner is reached via LEFT segment.
BL corner is reached via DOWN segment.
BR corner is reached via RIGHT segment (coming from the previous square's TR corner).

$N=2209$ (TR): reached by moving UP. The previous number, $2208$, is below it.
$2208$ is part of the Right Edge segment.

If $2025$ is the last number of the inner square, $2026$ starts the new perimeter.
$2026$ is adjacent to $2025$. Since 2025 is TR, $2026$ must be Up or Left of 2025.
Based on the snippet $1 \to 2$ (R), $2 \to 3$ (U), $3 \to 4$ (L), $4 \to 5$ (L), $5 \to 6$ (D), $6 \to 7$ (D), $7 \to 8$ (R), $8 \to 9$ (R). The spiral moves CCW.

If $2025$ is TR ($45^2$): The path turns UP to start the $47^2$ layer.
$2026$ is directly above $2025$.
$2026$ is on the Right Edge, moving UP towards $2209$.

Right Edge (moving UP):
The numbers on the right edge are $C_{BR}, C_{BR}+1, \dots, C_{TR}$.
$C_{TR} = 2209$. $S=46$.
The previous corner $C_{BR}$ (BR corner of $47^2$) must be $2209 - 46 = 2163$.
Wait, the BR corner must be reached via the Down segment.

Let's use the established corners for $47^2=2209$ (TR):
TR: 2209
TL: $2209 - 46 = 2163$ (Reached by Left segment)
BL: $2163 - 46 = 2117$ (Reached by Down segment)
BR: $2117 - 46 = 2071$ (Reached by Right segment)

The path leading into $2026$ must come from the Right segment of the previous square, which ends at $2025$.
The sequence going UP the right edge is: $2071, 2072, \dots, 2209$. (This is wrong, $2071$ is BR).

The path segments:
1. Right segment (BR to TR): This is the segment *before* the TR corner. Length $S$.
2. Up segment (TR to TL): $2209$ is TR. The path must turn Left from $2209$.

If $2025$ is the end of the path: the path turns UP to start the $47^2$ ring.
$2025 \to 2026$ (Up).
The UP segment is the right edge of the new square. It must connect $2025$ to the $C_{TR}$ corner $2209$ through $46$ steps if the side length is $46$.
$2025 + 46 = 2071$. If $2071$ is the TR corner, then $45^2$ is not TR.

Let's stick to $2025$ being the TR corner of $45^2$.
The spiral moves UP from 2025. This means $2026$ is directly above $2025$.
$2026$ is on the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square boundary.
The right edge runs from $C_{BR}$ to $C_{TR}$.

$C_{TR} = 2209$. $C_{BR} = 2071$. (Calculated above based on $S=46$).
The sequence along the right edge is $2071, 2072, \dots, 2209$ (moving UP).

If $2026$ is above $2025$, it must be $2025+1$.
$2025$ is located at coordinates $(+22, +22)$ relative to the center $(0,0)$, if we use $(R, U)$ coordinates where $R$ is Right/Left, $U$ is Up/Down. $2025 = 45^2$.
The number $2n^2 + 2n + 1$ is at $(n, -n+1)$ (BL corner of $2n+1$ square).
The number $4n^2 + 4n + 1$ is at $(n, n)$ (TR corner). For $n=22$, $(22, 22)$.

If $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$, then $2026$ is at $(22, 23)$. This is one step Up, on the right edge.
This position $(22, 23)$ is on the outer edge of the $47 \times 47$ square (which spans from $-23$ to $23$).

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(x=22, y=23)$ are the 8 surrounding cells:
$(x \pm 1, y), (x, y \pm 1), (x \pm 1, y \pm 1)$.

The numbers are determined by their distance from the center and their position along the perimeter.
The number $N$ at $(x, y)$ is approximately $S^2$, where $S = \max(|x|, |y|)$.
For $2026$, $S = 23$. $23^2 = 529$. This doesn't help much.
$2026$ is on the edge $x=23$ or $y=23$ of the $47 \times 47$ square (if we index from 1 to 47).
If the grid spans $[-23, 23]$ in both directions ($47 \times 47$ points), $2026$ is at $x=22, y=23$.

The numbers on the edge $y=23$ (Top edge): $2163 \to 2209$.
$2209$ is at $(22, 23)$. Wait, if $2025$ is $(22, 22)$, then $2026$ is $(22, 23)$.
$2209$ is TR, so $x=22, y=23$. No, $2n+1 = 45$, $n=22$. Coordinates are $(\pm n, \pm n)$.
$2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.

The next ring $n'=23$ spans $[-23, 23]$.
The segment $2025 \to 2209$ has length $184$. This is $4 \times 46$. It covers the entire $47 \times 47$ perimeter.
The path starts at the position adjacent to $2025$ and covers the entire perimeter, ending at $2209$.

If $2025$ is $(22, 22)$, the spiral moves UP:
$2026$ is at $(22, 23)$. This is the start of the UP segment (Right Edge).
This segment goes from $(22, 23)$ to $(22, -23)$? No, UP means increasing $y$.

The path for the $47 \times 47$ boundary (moving CCW):
1. Start: $2026$ at $(22, 23)$. (One step up from TR of previous square)
2. **UP** segment (Right Edge, $y$ increases): This path must end at the new TR corner, $2209$.
The points on the right edge ($x=22$) go from $(22, 23)$ up to $(22, 23)$? No, the maximum coordinate is $23$.
The perimeter is defined by $x=\pm 23$ or $y=\pm 23$.

$2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.
The path goes UP until $y=23$: $2026, 2027, \dots$.
The point $(23, 23)$ is TR of the $47 \times 47$ square.
$2209$ is the TR corner, located at $(23, 23)$ in the standard coordinate system where $n$ is the maximum coordinate.
If $2n+1 = 47$, $n=23$. TR corner is $(23, 23)$.

If $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$, and the spiral moves CCW:
The path enters the next ring by moving UP to $y=23$.
$2026$ is at $(22, 23)$.
The UP segment (Right Edge) goes from $(22, 23)$ to $(23, 23)$? No, that's only 2 points.

The side length is $46$. The perimeter consists of 4 segments of length 46.
The segment starting at $2026$ is the Right Edge segment. It should have length 46.

If $2209$ is at $(23, 23)$ (TR):
The path must reach $(23, 23)$ via the UP direction (from $(23, 22)$).
The Left segment must end at $2163$ (TL). TL is $(-23, 23)$.
The Down segment must end at $2117$ (BL). BL is $(-23, -23)$.
The Right segment must end at $2071$ (BR). BR is $(23, -23)$.

The path sequence: $\to$ Left $\to$ Down $\to$ Right $\to$ Up.
$2071 \to 2117$ (Down, length 46). $2117$ is BL.
$2117 \to 2163$ (Left, length 46). $2163$ is TL.
$2163 \to 2209$ (Up, length 46). $2209$ is TR.

The segment *before* $2071$ (BR) must be the Right segment, coming from the previous TR ($2025$).
The Right segment (ending at BR) must be: $2025 + 1, \dots, 2071$.
$2071 - 2025 = 46$. This is exactly the length of the side!

The path segments for the $47 \times 47$ boundary ($2026$ to $2209$):
1. **Right segment**: $2026, 2027, \dots, 2071$. (Length 46). Ends at BR $(23, -23)$.
2. **Down segment**: $2072, \dots, 2117$. (Length 46). Ends at BL $(-23, -23)$.
3. **Left segment**: $2118, \dots, 2163$. (Length 46). Ends at TL $(-23, 23)$.
4. **Up segment**: $2164, \dots, 2209$. (Length 46). Ends at TR $(23, 23)$.

The total length is $4 \times 46 = 184$. $2209 - 2025 = 184$. This confirms the structure.

$2026$ is the first number in the Right segment, meaning it is one step to the Right of $2025$.
If $2025$ is $(22, 22)$, then $2026$ is at $(23, 22)$.

Coordinates of 2026: $(x=23, y=22)$.
The 8 neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, 21), (23, 21), (24, 21)$ - Outside the $47 \times 47$ grid boundary ($x \le 23$).
    \item $(22, 22), (24, 22)$ - Outside.
    \item $(22, 23), (23, 23), (24, 23)$ - Outside.
\end{itemize}
The boundary of the $47 \times 47$ square is $x \in \{-23, 23\}$ or $y \in \{-23, 23\}$.
Since $2026$ is at $(23, 22)$, it is on the right edge ($x=23$).
Its neighbors must be within the boundaries of the square defined by the next layer, which is $49 \times 49$ (max coordinate 24).

The neighbors of $(23, 22)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, 21)$: Inner square (part of $45 \times 45$).
    \item $(23, 21)$: Inner square.
    \item $(24, 21)$: Outer square.
    \item $(22, 22)$: $2025$. (The number just before 2026)
    \item $(24, 22)$: Outer square.
    \item $(22, 23)$: Outer square.
    \item $(23, 23)$: $2209$ (TR corner).
    \item $(24, 23)$: Outer square.
\end{enumerate}
This implies we must check which neighbors are present in the set of natural numbers and identify their values.

$2026$ is on the Right segment: $2026, 2027, \dots, 2071$.
Position along the segment: $k = 2026 - 2025 = 1$.
$N(k) = 2025 + k$.

Coordinates mapping for the Right segment (R to BR, $x=23, y$ decreases from $22$ to $-23$):
If $k$ is the step number from $2025$ (i.e., $N = 2025+k$):
$k=1 \implies N=2026$. Position $(23, 22)$.
$k=46 \implies N=2071$. Position $(23, -23)$ (BR).

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, 22)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left neighbor: $(22, 22)$. This is $2025$.
    \item Left-Up: $(22, 23)$. This is on the boundary of the $47^2$ square.
    \item Left-Down: $(22, 21)$. This is inside the $45^2$ square.
\end{itemize}

**Neighbors inside the $45^2$ square (Inner):**
The square $45^2$ ends at $2025$ (TR). The numbers in this square are $1, \dots, 2025$.
The position $(22, 22)$ is the TR corner.
The position $(22, 21)$ is adjacent to TR, one step down.
The TR corner $(n, n)$ is reached by the UP move in the $n$-th square.
If $2025$ is TR, the element below it, $(22, 21)$, must be the last element of the previous segment (Up segment of $45^2$).
The segment before $2025$ (Up segment) ends at $2025$. The element before $2025$ is $2025 - 1 = 2024$ (if it's the Up segment).
$2025 - 44 = 1981$ (TL). $2025 - 3 \times 44 = 1893$ (BR).
The Up segment (from TL to TR) has length 44. $1981 \to 2025$.
$2024$ is at $(22, 21)$ (below 2025). $2024 = 2025 - 1$. This is correct.

Neighbor 1 (Left): $2025$.
Neighbor 2 (L-D): $2024$.

**Neighbors on the current boundary ($47^2$):**
3. Left-Up: $(22, 23)$. This point is on the boundary $y=23$. This is the start of the TL segment (Left segment). This point must be $2163$ or near it.
The TL corner $2163$ is at $(-23, 23)$. $(22, 23)$ is one step right of TL, along the Top edge.
The Top edge runs from TL $(-23, 23)$ to TR $(23, 23)$.
$2163 \to 2209$. $2209 - 2163 = 46$.
If $2163$ is TL, the Top edge is moving Right.
$2026$ is at $(23, 22)$.
The neighbor $(22, 23)$ is $2163 + (22 - (-23)) = 2163 + 45 = 2208$.
Wait, $2163$ is TL $(-23, 23)$. $2209$ is TR $(23, 23)$.
Position $(x, 23)$. $x$ goes from $-23$ to $23$.
If $x=22$, this is $2209 - 1 = 2208$.
Neighbor 3 (L-U): $2208$.

4. Straight Up: $(23, 23)$. This is the TR corner: $2209$.
Neighbor 4 (Up): $2209$.

5. Right-Up: $(24, 23)$. This point is outside the current boundary $47^2$ (max coordinate 23). It must belong to the $49^2$ boundary ($n=24$, max coordinate 24).
This point $(24, 23)$ is on the Left edge of the $49 \times 49$ square (moving Down).

**Neighbors on the outer boundary ($49^2$):**
The next square $49^2$ starts at $2209+1 = 2210$. The side length is $48$.
$2209$ is TR of $47^2$. The path moves Right from $2209$.
$2210$ is at $(23, 24)$ or $(24, 23)$.
Since the spiral moves R, U, L, D: after TR $(23, 23)$, it moves Left to the next square's boundary.
This means $2210$ is at $(22, 23)$? No, that was $2208$.

If $2209$ is TR $(23, 23)$:
Next move is Left: $2210$ is at $(22, 23)$. But this cell is $2208$. This means $2209$ is not the TR corner for the CCW spiral.

Let's trust the established segment structure: $2026$ is on the Right segment, moving towards BR $2071$.
$2026$ is $(23, 22)$.
$2027$ is $(23, 21)$.

Neighbors of $(23, 22)$:
A. Inner ($45^2$):
A1. $(22, 22) = 2025$.
A2. $(22, 21) = 2024$.

B. Current boundary ($47^2$):
B1. $(23, 23)$: TR corner $2209$? No, $2209$ is the end of the UP segment.
$2026$ is on the Right segment, moving down towards BR $(23, -23)$.
The segment is $2026, \dots, 2071$.
The Up neighbor of $2026$ is $(23, 23)$. This point is on the boundary of the $47^2$ square, but not the TR corner.
$2026$ is at $y=22$. The top boundary is $y=23$.
Neighbor $(23, 23)$: This point belongs to the Top Edge segment, starting at $2164$ (TL) and ending at $2209$ (TR).
Since $2209$ is TR $(23, 23)$, the number at $(23, 23)$ must be $2209$.
Neighbor 4 (Up): $2209$.

B2. $(22, 23)$: Left-Up. This point is on the Top Edge.
$2208$ is one step left of $2209$.
Neighbor 3 (L-U): $2208$.

C. Outer boundary ($49^2$):
C1. $(24, 22)$: Right. This point is on the Left edge of the $49^2$ square (moving Down).
The next square starts at $2210$. The side length is $48$. $4 \times 48 = 192$ points.
The boundary of $49^2$ is defined by $x=\pm 24$ or $y=\pm 24$.
The path moves Right from $2209$ (TR of $47^2$). $2210$ is at $(23, 24)$ or $(24, 23)$.
If the spiral moves R, U, L, D on the boundary: $2209$ is TR. Next move is Left.
$2210$ is at $(22, 23)$. But this is $2208$.

Let's use the known sum of neighbors for any point $N$ not on a major diagonal.
If $N$ is not a corner, the sum of its 8 neighbors is $8N$. This occurs when the neighbors perfectly balance around $N$.
For a number $N$ in the $k$-th ring, the neighbors are generally $N \pm 1, N \pm (2k), N \pm (2k+1), N \pm (2k-1)$.

The distance $d = 23$ from the center defines the region. $2026$ is on the perimeter of distance $d=23$.
The side length $S=46$. The difference between the numbers on opposite sides is $2S = 92$.

The number $N$ is at $(x, y)$. Neighbors are $N \pm 1, N \pm (2n), N \pm (2n+1), N \pm (2n-1)$.
For $N$ in ring $n$ (max coordinate $n$), $2n=46$.
The difference between numbers on the same side (e.g., 1 step left vs 1 step right) is $2 \times \text{coord}$.
The difference between opposite side neighbors is $2 \times (\text{side length}) = 2 \times 46 = 92$.

The neighbors relative to $2026$:
1. $2025$ (Inner, Left)
2. $2024$ (Inner, L-Down)

3. $2208$ (Current boundary, L-Up)
4. $2209$ (Current boundary, Up)
5. $X_5$ (Outer boundary, R-Up)

6. $2027$ (Current boundary, Right)
7. $2071 = 2026 + 45$ (BR corner)? No, $2026+45 = 2071$ is the end of the Right segment.
$2027$ is at $(23, 21)$.
Neighbor 6 (Right): $2027$.

8. $X_8$ (Outer boundary, R-Down)

Let's identify the outer neighbors by looking at $2026$'s position $(23, 22)$ relative to the $49 \times 49$ grid (max coordinate $24$).
The outer boundary is $x=24$ or $y=24$.

The path turns Right from $2209$ (TR of $47^2$) to start $49^2$.
$2209$ is $(23, 23)$. Next move is Right: $2210$ is at $(24, 23)$.
The Right segment of $49^2$ starts at $(24, 24)$ (BR corner of $49^2$) and moves Up. This is the spiral turning outwards.

If the spiral is CCW (R $\to$ U $\to$ L $\to$ D):
The number after TR $(23, 23)$ is $2210$ at $(22, 23)$? No, $2208$.

The sequence of corners suggests the spiral path is not strictly $N \to N+1$ being adjacent in one direction.
Since $2026$ is in the Right segment ($2026 \to 2071$, $y$ decreases):

$N=2026$ at $(23, 22)$.
Neighbors:
1. $(22, 22) = 2025$
2. $(22, 21) = 2024$

3. $(22, 23) = 2208$ (Top Edge)
4. $(23, 23) = 2209$ (TR Corner)

5. $(24, 23)$: This is the next layer $49^2$. Since $2209$ is TR, the next number $2210$ starts moving Right. $2210$ is at $(24, 23)$.
Neighbor 5 (R-U): $2210$.

6. $(24, 22)$: This point is on the Right edge of the $49^2$ square, moving Down.
The Right edge of $49^2$ goes from BR $(24, -24)$ to TR $(24, 24)$? No.
TR corner of $49^2$ is $(24, 24)$. BR is $(24, -24)$? No. $S'=48$.
$49^2 = 2401$. TR is $(24, 24)$.
TL: $2401 - 48 = 2353$.
BL: $2353 - 48 = 2305$.
BR: $2305 - 48 = 2257$.

The Right segment (R segment) for $49^2$ goes from $2209+1$ to $2257$.
$2210, 2211, \dots, 2257$. Length 48. This segment moves Down.
$2210$ is at $(24, 23)$.
$2257$ is at $(24, -24)$. (BR corner)

Neighbor 5 (R-U): $(24, 23) = 2210$.
Neighbor 6 (Right): $(24, 22) = 2211$.

7. $(24, 21)$: Outer boundary, Right edge. $2212$.
8. $(22, 21)$ is $2024$.
Neighbor 8 (R-D): $(24, 21) = 2212$.

Neighbors list:
1. $2025$ (L)
2. $2024$ (L-D)
3. $2208$ (L-U)
4. $2209$ (U)
5. $2210$ (R-U)
6. $2211$ (R)
7. $2212$ (R-D)
8. $2027$ (D)? Wait, we missed the Down neighbor.

$2026$ is at $(23, 22)$.
7. Down neighbor: $(23, 21)$. This is on the Right segment, $2026+1 = 2027$.
Neighbor 7 (D): $2027$.

8. R-D neighbor: $(24, 21)$. We assumed this was $2212$. Let's verify if $(24, 21)$ is $2212$.
$2210 (24, 23), 2211 (24, 22), 2212 (24, 21), \dots$
The Right segment moves Down. So $(24, 21)$ is $2212$.

List of 8 Neighbors:
$N_1 = 2025$ (L)
$N_2 = 2024$ (L-D)
$N_3 = 2208$ (L-U)
$N_4 = 2209$ (U)
$N_5 = 2210$ (R-U)
$N_6 = 2211$ (R) $\implies$ ERROR: $2026$ is at $(23, 22)$. $2211$ is at $(24, 22)$.
$N_7 = 2027$ (D)
$N_8 = 2212$ (R-D)

Let's re-evaluate the neighbors based on coordinates $(23, 22)$:
(L, U) = $(22, 23) = 2208$
(L) = $(22, 22) = 2025$
(L, D) = $(22, 21) = 2024$

(U) = $(23, 23) = 2209$
(D) = $(23, 21) = 2027$

(R, U) = $(24, 23) = 2210$
(R) = $(24, 22) = 2211$
(R, D) = $(24, 21) = 2212$

Sum $S$:
$S = (2025 + 2024 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2027)$

Sum of inner neighbors: $2025 + 2024 + 2027 = 6076$.
Sum of current boundary neighbors: $2208 + 2209 = 4417$.
Sum of outer boundary neighbors: $2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 6633$.

$S = 6076 + 4417 + 6633$
$S = 10493 + 6633 = 17126$.

Check the arithmetic:
$2025 + 2024 + 2027 = 4049 + 2027 = 6076$. Correct.
$2208 + 2209 = 4417$. Correct.
$2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 3 \times 2211 = 6633$. Correct.

$6076 + 4417 = 10493$.
$10493 + 6633 = 17126$.

Final confirmation of neighbor values based on $N=2026$ being on the Right Segment ($2026 \to 2071$):
The structure of neighbors of $N$ in a ring $d$ (side $2d$) where $N$ is not a corner:
Neighbors are approximately $N \pm 1, N \pm (2d), N \pm (2d+1), N \pm (2d-1)$.
Here $d=23$ for the outer ring ($47^2$), $2d=46$.
The values surrounding $2026$ are:
Inner: $2026 \pm 1 \implies 2025, 2027$. (Correct: $2025, 2027$)
Inner diagonal: $2026 - 46 = 1980$ (Not present), $2026 + 46 = 2072$ (Past $2071$).
The relationship is based on the coordinates.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is 17126.
