The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid as follows:
$$\begin{array}{ccccccc} \dots & 17 & 16 & 15 & 14 & 13 & \dots \\ \dots & 18 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 12 & \dots \\ \dots & 19 & 6 & 1 & 2 & 11 & \dots \\ \dots & 20 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots \\ \dots & 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 & \dots \end{array}$$

The spiral is formed by moving outwards in layers.
Layer 0: Contains only the number 1. Side length $s_0 = 1$. Max number $M_0 = 1^2 = 1$.
Layer 1: The square containing numbers up to $3^2=9$. The numbers form a $3 \times 3$ square. Side length $s_1 = 3$. Max number $M_1 = 3^2 = 9$. The corners are $3, 5, 7, 9$.
Layer 2: The square containing numbers up to $5^2=25$. The numbers form a $5 \times 5$ square. Side length $s_2 = 5$. Max number $M_2 = 5^2 = 25$. The corners are $13, 17, 21, 25$.
Layer $k$: The square has side length $s_k = 2k+1$. The maximum number in this layer is $M_k = (2k+1)^2$.

We need to find the layer $k$ that contains the number $N = 2026$.
We find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2$.
Since $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$, we look for $2k+1$ close to $45.01$.
If $2k+1 = 45$, then $2k = 44$, so $k=22$.
If $k=22$, then $s_{22} = 2(22)+1 = 45$. The maximum number in this layer is $M_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$.
Since $2026 > 2025$, the number 2026 is in the next layer, Layer $k=23$.
For $k=23$, the side length is $s_{23} = 2(23)+1 = 47$. The maximum number in this layer is $M_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$.
So, $2026$ is on the perimeter of the $47 \times 47$ square, which contains numbers from $45^2+1=2026$ to $47^2=2209$.

Let's examine the position of $M_{k-1} = (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2$.
For $k=23$, $k-1=22$. $M_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$. This is the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square. In the spiral construction, this number is the bottom-right corner.

The path of the spiral for layer $k$ (with side length $s_k = 2k+1$ and max number $M_k = (2k+1)^2$):
The previous layer $k-1$ ends at $M_{k-1} = (2k-1)^2$. This is the bottom-right corner of the $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ square.
The next number, $M_{k-1}+1 = (2k-1)^2+1$, is one step to the right (if we consider the orientation of the $45 \times 45$ square).
The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square are:
Let $L = 2k = 46$. The side length is $s = 2k+1 = 47$.
The largest number is $M_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$. This is the bottom-right corner.
The previous corner is $C_3 = (47-2)^2 + (47-2) = 45^2+45 = 2025+45=2070$ (This is not correct for the standard Ulam spiral).

Let's trace the path from $M_{k-1} = 2025$:
The $45 \times 45$ square ends at $2025$. This is the bottom-right corner.
The next segment goes left from 2025 to $2025 - (45-1) = 2025 - 44 = 1981$. This is the bottom-left corner.
The next segment goes up from 1981 to $1981 - 44 = 1937$. This is the top-left corner.
The next segment goes right from 1937 to $1937 - 44 = 1893$. This is the top-right corner.
The next segment goes down from 1893 to $1893 - 44 = 1849 = 43^2$. This is the end of the previous layer's path, which is not right.

Let's use the standard representation where the center is 1.
$k=0$: $1$.
$k=1$ (size 3x3): Ends at $3^2=9$.
$9$ is bottom-right.
$8$ is left of $9$.
$7$ is left of $8$.
$6$ is up from $7$.
$5$ is up from $6$.
$4$ is right of $5$.
$3$ is right of $4$.
$2$ is down from $3$.
$1$ is left of $2$.

$k=2$ (size 5x5): Ends at $5^2=25$.
$25$ is bottom-right.
$24$ is left of $25$.
$23$ is left of $24$.
$22$ is left of $23$.
$21$ is up from $22$.
...
$10$ is down from $11$.
$9$ is left of $10$.

The maximum number of layer $k$ is $M_k = (2k+1)^2$, located at the bottom-right corner.
For $k=23$, $M_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$. This is at the bottom-right corner.
The previous layer maximum is $M_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$. This is the number just "inside" the bottom-right corner of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The path segment leading to $2209$ is the bottom edge. The length of this edge is $2k = 46$.
The numbers on the bottom edge are from $2209 - 46$ to $2209$. Wait, the length of the side is $2k+1=47$. The number of steps taken is $2k=46$.
The numbers are $2209, 2208, \dots, 2209-46 = 2163$.
The last number of the previous layer, $2025$, is at $(2k-1)^2$. This position is one step up from the bottom edge.
The bottom edge runs from $x=23$ to $x=-23$ at $y=-23$ in a coordinate system centered at 1.
The number $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ if the side is $2k+1$. Let $k=22$. $45 \times 45$. Center is $(0,0)$.
The corners of the $45 \times 45$ square:
Top-Right: $13$. $3^2=9$. $13$ is $9+4$. $2k+1=3$. $k=1$. $13 = 5^2-12$. No.
Corners for $M_k=(2k+1)^2$:
TR: $M_k - 2k$.
TL: $M_k - 4k$.
BL: $M_k - 6k$.
BR: $M_k$.

For $k=22$, $2k=44$. $M_{22}=2025$.
TR: $2025 - 44 = 1981$.
TL: $2025 - 88 = 1937$.
BL: $2025 - 132 = 1893$.
End of layer: $1849 = 43^2$. Wait, $M_{21}=43^2=1849$.
The sequence should be: $1849 \to 1850 \to \dots \to 1893 \to 1894 \to \dots \to 1937 \to 1938 \to \dots \to 1981 \to 1982 \to \dots \to 2025$.
The path for $k=22$ is:
Start at $1850$ (one right of $1849$).
Bottom edge (from right to left): $2025, 2024, \dots, 1894$. $2025-1894+1 = 132$ numbers. $2k+1=45$. $2k=44$. The segment has $2k=44$ steps, so $45$ numbers.
$1849$ is BL corner of $43 \times 43$. $2k-1=43$.
The square has side $45$. The path goes from $1850$ up $44$ steps to $1893$. No, this is confusing.

Let's use the coordinates based on $1$ being at $(0,0)$.
The layer $k$ is defined by $\max(|x|, |y|) = k$.
The maximum number in layer $k$ is $M_k = (2k+1)^2$. This is at $(k, -k)$, the bottom-right corner.
For $N=2026$, $k=23$. $M_{23}=2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
The side length of the perimeter of this square is $2k = 46$ steps, $47$ numbers.
The segment ending at $M_k$ is the bottom edge, traversed from right to left.
The number $M_k$ is the $1^{st}$ number in this segment (counting backwards from $M_k$).
The previous corner is $C_3 = M_k - 2k = 2209 - 46 = 2163$. This is the bottom-left corner $( -k, -k)$.
The segment before that is the left edge, traversed upwards. $C_2 = C_3 - 2k = 2163 - 46 = 2117$. This is the top-left corner $(-k, k)$.
The segment before that is the top edge, traversed from left to right. $C_1 = C_2 - 2k = 2117 - 46 = 2071$. This is the top-right corner $(k, k)$.
The segment before that is the right edge, traversed downwards. $C_0 = C_1 - 2k = 2071 - 46 = 2025$. This is the number $M_{k-1} = 45^2 = 2025$. This number is at $(k, -k+1) = (23, -22)$.

The coordinates of the corners for layer $k=23$ are:
$C_0 = 2025$ at $(23, -22)$ (one above the bottom edge, on the right side).
$C_1 = 2071$ at $(23, 23)$ (Top-Right corner).
$C_2 = 2117$ at $(-23, 23)$ (Top-Left corner).
$C_3 = 2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ (Bottom-Left corner).
$M_{23} = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$ (Bottom-Right corner).

The number $N=2026$ is on the right edge, which runs from $C_0$ to $M_{23}$.
The right edge is where $x=k=23$. The $y$ coordinate decreases from $-22$ to $-23$.
The numbers on this edge are: $2025$ at $(23, -22)$.
The next number is $2026$ at $(23, -23+1)$ if we go from $2025$ towards $2209$.
The path for $k=23$:
1. Start from $2025$ at $(23, -22)$.
2. Move down along $x=23$. The next position is $(23, -23)$, which is $M_{23} = 2209$. No, this is wrong.
The path for layer $k$ goes from $M_{k-1} = (2k-1)^2$ to $M_k = (2k+1)^2$.
$M_{22} = 2025$. It is at the corner $(22, -22)$.
The spiral starts going right from $2025$:
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. (Moving right one step).
The right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square is $x=23$. The $y$ coordinate ranges from $-23$ to $23$.
The top-right corner is $C_1 = 2071$ at $(23, 23)$.
The bottom-right corner is $M_{23} = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$.

The sequence of numbers on the right edge ($x=23$) starting from the top-right corner $C_1=2071$ and going down to $M_{23}=2209$:
$2071$ at $(23, 23)$.
$2070$ at $(23, 22)$? No, the numbers are increasing as we move along the spiral.

Let's re-establish the coordinates for the corners of layer $k$:
$M_k = (2k+1)^2$ is at $(k, -k)$. (Bottom-Right)
$C_3 = M_k - 2k = (2k+1)^2 - 2k$ is at $(-k, -k)$. (Bottom-Left)
$C_2 = C_3 - 2k = (2k+1)^2 - 4k$ is at $(-k, k)$. (Top-Left)
$C_1 = C_2 - 2k = (2k+1)^2 - 6k$ is at $(k, k)$. (Top-Right)
$M_{k-1}+1 = C_1 - 2k + 1 = (2k+1)^2 - 8k + 1 = (2k-1)^2+1$. Wait, $C_0 = C_1-2k = (2k+1)^2-8k = 4k^2+4k+1-8k = 4k^2-4k+1 = (2k-1)^2 = M_{k-1}$. This should be the number just before the path for layer $k$ starts, which is $M_{k-1}$ at $(k, -k+1)$ or $(k, -k+1)$ depending on the drawing.

For $k=23$, $2k=46$. $M_{23}=2209$.
$M_{22}=2025$.
$C_1 = 2209 - 6(23) = 2209 - 138 = 2071$. At $(23, 23)$. (Top-Right)
$C_2 = 2071 - 46 = 2025$. Wait, $C_2$ should be $2209 - 4(23) = 2209 - 92 = 2117$. At $(-23, 23)$. (Top-Left)
$C_3 = 2117 - 46 = 2071$. No, $C_3 = 2209 - 2(23) = 2209 - 46 = 2163$. At $(-23, -23)$. (Bottom-Left)
$M_{22} = 2025$. The number $2025$ is one step before $2026$.
The path for layer 23 starts from $2025$. $2026$ is the first number in the path.
The path goes from $M_{k-1}=(2k-1)^2$ to $M_k=(2k+1)^2$.
The segment leading to $M_k$ is the bottom edge, traversed from right to left.

The segment ending at $M_k=2209$ (bottom-right) has length $2k=46$. So it has $47$ numbers.
The numbers are $\dots, 2209-46, \dots, 2209$.
The number $2209 - 46 = 2163$ is at the bottom-left corner $C_3$.

The path of layer $k$ starts one step away from $M_{k-1}$.
$M_{22} = 2025$. It is at $(22, -22)$.
The spiral moves right from $2025$ to the right edge $x=23$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. (One step right).
Then it moves up towards $C_1=2071$ at $(23, 23)$. The right edge is traversed upwards.
The numbers on the right edge ($x=23$) are from $2026$ to $2071$.
$2071 - 2026 + 1 = 46$ numbers. The length of the side is $2k+1=47$. The segment length is $2k=46$. This matches.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.

We are looking for the 8 neighbors of $N=2026$ at position $(x, y) = (23, -22)$.
The neighbors are $(x+dx, y+dy)$ where $dx, dy \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $(dx, dy) \neq (0, 0)$.
The coordinates of the neighbors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(24, -23)$
    \item $(24, -22)$
    \item $(24, -21)$
    \item $(23, -23)$
    \item $(23, -21)$
    \item $(22, -23)$
    \item $(22, -22)$
    \item $(22, -21)$
\end{enumerate}

We need to identify which layer these neighbors belong to.
Since $2026$ is on the boundary of layer $k=23$, its neighbors can be in layer $k=22$ or layer $k=23$.
The boundary of layer $k=23$ is defined by $\max(|x|, |y|) = 23$.
The boundary of layer $k=22$ is defined by $\max(|x|, |y|) = 22$.

$N=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This point is on the right edge, since $x=23$ and $|y| \le 23$.

The neighbors:
1. $(24, -23)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 24$. This is in layer $k=24$.
2. $(24, -22)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 24$. Layer $k=24$.
3. $(24, -21)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 24$. Layer $k=24$.
4. $(23, -23)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 23$. Layer $k=23$. This is $M_{23}=2209$.
5. $(23, -21)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 23$. Layer $k=23$.
6. $(22, -23)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 23$. Layer $k=23$.
7. $(22, -22)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 22$. Layer $k=22$. This is $M_{22}=2025$.
8. $(22, -21)$: $\max(|x|, |y|) = 22$. Layer $k=22$.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is the sum of the numbers at these 8 locations.
We need the values of the numbers at these coordinates.

Layer $k=24$: $M_{24} = 49^2 = 2401$. $2k=48$.
The corners are:
$C'_1$: $2401 - 6(24) = 2401 - 144 = 2257$ at $(24, 24)$.
$C'_3$: $2401 - 2(24) = 2401 - 48 = 2353$ at $(-24, -24)$.
The path for layer 24 starts from $M_{23}=2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
The spiral moves right from $2209$.
$2210$ at $(24, -23)$. This is neighbor 1.
$2210$ to $2257$ is the right edge traversed upwards.
The right edge for layer 24 ($x=24$) runs from $y=-24$ to $y=24$. Length $2k=48$.
The number $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$. The next number is $2210$ at $(24, -23)$.
The path goes up along $x=24$ from $y=-23$ to $y=24$.
$2210$ is at $(24, -23)$. (Neighbor 1)
The coordinates for neighbors 1, 2, 3 are: $(24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)$.
These are consecutive numbers along the right edge of layer 24, starting from the bottom.
The number at $(24, -23)$ is $2210$.
The number at $(24, -22)$ is $2211$. (Neighbor 2)
The number at $(24, -21)$ is $2212$. (Neighbor 3)

Layer $k=23$: $N=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. The right edge is $x=23$, going up from $y=-22$ to $y=23$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$. (Neighbor 5)
$2071$ at $(23, 23)$.

The left edge of layer 23 is $x=-23$, going up from $y=-23$ to $y=23$. $C_3=2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ and $C_2=2117$ at $(-23, 23)$.
The number at $(23, -23)$ is $2209$. (Neighbor 4)

The coordinates for neighbors 4, 5, 6 are: $(23, -23), (23, -21), (22, -23)$.
Neighbor 4: $(23, -23)$ is $M_{23} = 2209$.
Neighbor 5: $(23, -21)$ is $2026 + 1 = 2027$.

The coordinates for neighbor 6: $(22, -23)$. This is on the bottom edge of layer 23.
The bottom edge goes from $C_3=2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ to $C_4=2209$ at $(23, -23)$. Traversed right to left.
$2209$ is the first number from the right.
The number at $(23, -23)$ is $2209$.
The number at $(22, -23)$ is $2209 - 1 = 2208$. (Neighbor 6)

Layer $k=22$: $M_{22}=2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
Neighbor 7: $(22, -22)$ is $M_{22} = 2025$.
Neighbor 8: $(22, -21)$. This is one step up from $M_{22}=2025$ on the right edge of layer 22.
The right edge of layer 22 ($x=22$) goes from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 22)$.
The number at $(22, -22)$ is $2025$.
The number at $(22, -21)$ is $2025 + 1 = 2026$. No, this is wrong. $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
The numbers on the right edge of layer $k=22$ run from $M_{21}+1 = 43^2+1 = 1850$ to $M_{22}=2025$.
$M_{21} = 1849$ at $(-22, -22)$. No, $M_{21}$ is at $(22, -22)$. No, this is for $k=21$.
For $k=22$, $M_{22}=2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The path segment leading to $2025$ is the bottom edge, from right to left.
$C'_3 = 1937$ at $(-22, -22)$.
The bottom edge of layer 22 ($y=-22$) runs from $x=22$ to $x=-22$. Length $2k=44$. $45$ numbers.
$2025$ is the rightmost number. $2025-44 = 1981$ is the leftmost number at $(-22, -22)$. No, this is not consistent with the previous corner definition.

Let's use the previous layer's corner for $M_{k-1}$: $M_{22}=2025$.
It's at $(22, -22)$.
The path segment entering $2025$ is the bottom edge, from right to left.
The number immediately to the left of $2025$ at $(21, -22)$ is $2024$.
The number immediately below $2025$ at $(22, -23)$ is $2209-1 = 2208$ (from layer 23).

Neighbor 8: $(22, -21)$. This is one position up from $2025$ on the right edge of layer 22.
The right edge of layer 22 ($x=22$) is traversed upwards.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2025+1 = 2026$. Wait, $2026$ is not at $(22, -21)$. $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
The numbers on the right edge of layer 22 are consecutive.
The number at $(22, -21)$ is $2025 + 1 = 2026$.
This means that $2026$ is a neighbor of $2025$, but we found $2026$ at $(23, -22)$. This implies a contradiction in the coordinate mapping.

Let's trust the spiral construction: $2025 \to 2026 \to \dots$
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$. (Right)
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$. (Up)
$2028$ at $(23, -20)$. (Up)
...
$2071$ at $(23, 23)$. (Top-Right)
$2072$ at $(22, 23)$. (Left)
...
$2117$ at $(-23, 23)$. (Top-Left)
$2118$ at $(-23, 22)$. (Down)
...
$2163$ at $(-23, -23)$. (Bottom-Left)
$2164$ at $(-22, -23)$. (Right)
...
$2209$ at $(23, -23)$. (Bottom-Right)

Summary of coordinates and values for neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$:
1. $(24, -23)$: Layer 24. $2209 \to 2210$ is the start of the right edge of layer 24. $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$. The path goes right from $2209$.
$2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.
$2210$ is at $(24, -23)$. (Neighbor 1)
$2211$ is at $(24, -22)$. (Neighbor 2)
$2212$ is at $(24, -21)$. (Neighbor 3)

4. $(23, -23)$: $M_{23} = 2209$. (Neighbor 4)
5. $(23, -21)$: $2026+1 = 2027$. (Neighbor 5)

6. $(22, -23)$: This is on the bottom edge of layer 23. $2209$ at $(23, -23)$. Left is $2208$.
$2209 \to 2208$. (Neighbor 6)

7. $(22, -22)$: $M_{22} = 2025$. (Neighbor 7)
8. $(22, -21)$: This is on the right edge of layer 22, traversed upwards from $2025$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2025+1 = 2026$. But $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This means $(22, -21)$ is not $2026$.
The right edge of layer 22 is from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 22)$.
The number $2025$ is the endpoint of the bottom edge, so it's the last number on the bottom row.
The path continues up from $2025$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2025+1 = 2026$. This must be at $(22, -21)$.
But we established $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This is the key contradiction.

Let's re-examine the position of $2025$ and $2026$.
$M_{22}=2025$ is the end of layer 22. It is the bottom-right corner $(22, -22)$.
Layer 23 starts at $2026$. The path leaves the square of $45 \times 45$ by moving one step right.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$. (Right move). This is correct.

So, neighbor 7 is $2025$ at $(22, -22)$. This is correct.
Neighbor 8 is at $(22, -21)$. This is inside the $45 \times 45$ square, one step up from $2025$.
The path for layer 22 continues upwards from $2025$ to $2071$. No, $2071$ is the top-right corner of layer 23.

The right edge of layer 22 ($x=22$) is traversed upwards from $y=-22$ to $y=22$.
The numbers are $2025, 2026, \dots$
If $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, then the number at $(22, -21)$ must be $> 2026$ or $< 2026$.
If $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$, and the path moves up along $x=22$:
$(22, -22) \to (22, -21) \to (22, -20) \to \dots \to (22, 22)$.
The numbers are $2025, 2025+1, 2025+2, \dots$
The number of steps up is $22 - (-22) = 44$ steps. $45$ numbers.
$2025$ to $2025+44 = 2069$. The top-right corner of layer 22 is $2069$ at $(22, 22)$.
This means neighbor 8 is $2025+1 = 2026$.
Wait, this means $2026$ has two locations, $(23, -22)$ and $(22, -21)$. This is impossible.

The key must be that the spiral does not fill the square completely. The numbers are only on the path.

Let's re-evaluate the neighbors based on the path:
$2025$ is on the path.
$2026$ is on the path.
The neighbors of $N$ are the numbers on the path adjacent to $N$, or in the grid squares immediately surrounding $N$.

Since the spiral is on a square grid, we must use the positions. The position $(22, -21)$ must contain a number.

If $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$, and $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, then the path is:
$\dots \leftarrow 2024 \leftarrow 2025 \to 2026 \to 2027 \to \dots$
The number at $(22, -21)$ is not on the spiral path that passes through $2025$ and $2026$.
The path segment around $2025$ and $2026$ is:
$(22, -23) \leftarrow (22, -22) \leftarrow (21, -22) \leftarrow (21, -21) \leftarrow \dots$ (Previous layers)
$(22, -22) = 2025$.
$(23, -22) = 2026$.
$(23, -23) = 2209$ (Layer 23).
$(22, -23) = 2208$ (Layer 23).

The number at $(22, -21)$ is in the region of layer 22.
If the right edge of layer 22 is traversed upwards from $2025$ at $(22, -22)$, then $(22, -21)$ should be $2026$.
But $(23, -22)$ is $2026$. This implies that the spiral at $2025$ must turn right, not up.

If $2025$ is the bottom-right corner of $45 \times 45$, the next layer starts by moving right from $2025$.
The path for layer 23 starts at $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
The path for layer 22 ends at $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The path segment for layer 22 along the right edge ($x=22$) is from $(22, -22)$ up to $(22, 22)$. The numbers are $2025, 2026, \dots$
If $2026$ is at $(22, -21)$, then $2027$ is at $(22, -20)$, etc.
This contradicts $2026$ being at $(23, -22)$.

The only way this works is if the path of layer 22 does not include the position $(22, -21)$.
The corners of the $45 \times 45$ square (Layer 22):
$M_{22}=2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$C'_3 = 1981$ at $(-22, -22)$. (Bottom-Left)
$C'_2 = 1937$ at $(-22, 22)$. (Top-Left)
$C'_1 = 1893$ at $(22, 22)$. (Top-Right)
$M_{21}=1849$ at $(22, -21)$. (This would be the rightmost before the end).

If $M_{21}=1849$ is at $(22, -21)$, then $2025$ is not the corner.
Let's use the standard representation of Ulam spiral corners:
$M_k = (2k+1)^2$ at $(k, -k)$.
$C_1 = M_k - 2k$. At $(-k, k)$.
$C_2 = M_k - 4k$. At $(-k, -k)$.
$C_3 = M_k - 6k$. At $(k, -k)$. Wait, the corners are on the sides.

Let's assume the path is as derived from the corner calculation:
$C_1 = 2071$ at $(23, 23)$ TR
$C_2 = 2117$ at $(-23, 23)$ TL
$C_3 = 2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ BL
$M_{23} = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$ BR

The path is $2025 \to 2026 \to \dots \to 2209$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$ (Right edge, 2nd from bottom).

Neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$:
1. $(24, -23) \to 2210$ (Layer 24, bottom edge).
2. $(24, -22) \to 2211$ (Layer 24, right edge).
3. $(24, -21) \to 2212$ (Layer 24, right edge).
4. $(23, -23) \to 2209$ (Layer 23, BR corner).
5. $(23, -21) \to 2027$ (Layer 23, right edge).
6. $(22, -23) \to 2208$ (Layer 23, bottom edge).
7. $(22, -22) \to 2025$ (Layer 22, BR corner).
8. $(22, -21)$: This position must be filled by a number from layer 22.
The path for layer 22 ends at $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The numbers on the right edge of layer 22 are $1894, \dots, 2025$.
The right edge ($x=22$) is traversed upwards from $y=-22$ to $y=22$.
The number below $2025$ is $2024$ (if the path went down). Since $2025$ is the end, the number below it is not on the path.

The number at $(22, -21)$ is in the region of layer 22. Since $2025$ is the end of layer 22, the path for layer 23 starts outside. The neighbors that are in the previous layer must be the ones that were traversed immediately before $2025$.
The path for layer 22 ends at $2025$. The previous number $2024$ must be at $(22, -21)$.
The traversal of the right edge ($x=22$): $2025$ at $(22, -22)$. The number before it, $2024$, should be at $(22, -21)$.
If $2024$ is at $(22, -21)$, then neighbor 8 is $2024$.

Let's verify the order of traversal for layer $k=22$:
$M_{21}=1849$. Start $1850$.
Top edge: $1850, \dots, 1893=C'_1$.
Left edge: $1894, \dots, 1937=C'_2$.
Bottom edge: $1938, \dots, 1981=C'_3$.
Right edge: $1982, \dots, 2025=M_{22}$.
The right edge is traversed downwards from top to bottom.
$C'_1=1893$ at $(22, 22)$.
$M_{22}=2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The number at $(22, -21)$ is $2025 - 1 = 2024$. (Neighbor 8)

The sum of the neighbors:
Sum $= 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= (2210+2211+2212) + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= 6633 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= 8842 + 2027 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= 10869 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= 13077 + 2025 + 2024$
Sum $= 15102 + 2024$
Sum $= 17126$.

Final verification of neighbors:
$N=2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
Layer 24 (outside): $2210, 2211, 2212$ at $(24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)$.
Layer 23 (outer boundary): $2209$ at $(23, -23)$, $2027$ at $(23, -21)$, $2208$ at $(22, -23)$.
Layer 22 (inside): $2025$ at $(22, -22)$, $2024$ at $(22, -21)$.

Sum $= 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 2025 + 2024 = 17126$.
