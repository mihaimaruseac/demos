Solution:
The problem asks for the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026, where the numbers are arranged in a square spiral starting from 1 at the center.

First, we need to determine the layer (or ring) in which the number 2026 lies. The layers of the spiral are perfect squares. The $k$-th layer (for $k \ge 1$) consists of numbers whose largest value is $(2k+1)^2$.

Let $n = 2026$. We find the smallest odd square greater than or equal to $n$:
$43^2 = 1849$
$45^2 = 2025$
$47^2 = 2209$

Since $2025 = 45^2$, the number 2025 is the largest number in the layer defined by the odd square $2k+1 = 45$.
$2k+1 = 45 \implies 2k = 44 \implies k = 22$.
This means 2025 is the end of the $k=22$ layer, or equivalently, it's the largest number in the "ring" whose side length is 45.

The number 2026 is immediately to the right of 2025, so it is the first number in the next layer, which has side length $45+2 = 47$.

The number $N = (2k+1)^2$ is located at the bottom right corner of the $(k-1)$-th layer (if we define the layers based on the difference from the center, layer $k$ has maximum value $(2k+1)^2$).
If the side length is $s = 2k+1$, the square is the $(s \times s)$ square. The corners are:
Top right: $(s-1)^2 + (s-1) = s^2 - s + 1$
Top left: $s^2 - s + 1 + (s-1) = s^2 - 1$
Bottom left: $s^2 - 1 + (s-1) = s^2 + s - 2$
Bottom right: $s^2$

Let's look at the layer containing 2026. This layer starts after $45^2 = 2025$.
The numbers in the next layer (side length $s=47$) start from $45^2 + 1 = 2026$.
The maximum number in this layer is $47^2 = 2209$.

The number 2026 is at the beginning of the side corresponding to the path moving right from the bottom right corner of the previous square.
$45^2 = 2025$ is at the bottom right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.

The spiral moves as follows:
Layer $s=45$: ends at $45^2 = 2025$. This is the bottom right corner.
The path continues upwards from 2025.
Position of 2025: Bottom Right Corner.
$2025 \xrightarrow{Up} 2026$ (This is incorrect based on the standard Ulam spiral where 1 is center and moves right, then up, left, down, right).

Let's confirm the path starting from 1:
1 (Center)
Right: 2
Up: 3, 4
Left: 5, 6, 7
Down: 8, 9, 10
Right: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

The number $N$ is on the $s \times s$ square where $s = 2k+1$. The side length $s$ increases by 2 for each new layer.
The corners of the $s \times s$ square:
$s=3$ (Max 9, $k=1$): TR=3, TL=5, BL=7, BR=9.
$s=5$ (Max 25, $k=2$): TR=13, TL=17, BL=21, BR=25.

The largest number in the $(s-2) \times (s-2)$ square is $(s-2)^2$.
The numbers in the $s \times s$ square are from $(s-2)^2 + 1$ to $s^2$.

For 2026, we have $s=47$. $(s-2)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
The numbers in this layer are from 2026 to 2209.
The path segment starts at $(s-2)^2 + 1 = 2026$.

The corners of the $s \times s$ square ($s=47$):
Bottom Right (BR): $47^2 = 2209$
Bottom Left (BL): $47^2 - 46 = 2163$
Top Left (TL): $47^2 - 2 \times 46 = 2117$
Top Right (TR): $47^2 - 3 \times 46 = 2071$

The segment from $(s-2)^2 + 1$ to the next corner (TR) is the first side.
Side 1 (Right edge, moving Up): From $2025+1=2026$ to $2025 + 46 = 2071$.
The number $45^2 = 2025$ is the Bottom Right corner of the previous layer.
The next side (Upwards movement) starts at 2026.

The standard layout based on the example:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

$s=3$, $9$ is BR.
$9 \xrightarrow{Up} 10$ (This is WRONG based on the example: $8 \xrightarrow{Right} 9$).
The example shows:
2 is on the Right edge.
3 is on the Top edge.
4, 5 are on the Left edge.
6 is on the Left edge.
7, 8 are on the Bottom edge.
9 is the BR corner.

The spiral grows outwards:
1 is at (0, 0).
2 is at (1, 0) (Right)
3 is at (1, 1) (Up)
4 is at (0, 1) (Left)
5 is at (-1, 1)
6 is at (-1, 0)
7 is at (-1, -1)
8 is at (0, -1)
9 is at (1, -1) (BR corner of $3 \times 3$)

$s=3$, $9$ is at (1, -1).
The numbers in the $3 \times 3$ square are from 2 to 9. $1$ is the center.

$s=5$ square, max 25, at (2, -2).
The path from 9 (1, -1) to 25 (2, -2):
9 (1, -1) $\xrightarrow{R} 10, 11$ (to (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1)?) No.

Let's use the coordinates relative to the center (1 at (0, 0)).
Layer $k$: Maximum value $M_k = (2k+1)^2$. The coordinates are in $[-k, k] \times [-k, k]$.
For $N=2026$: $45^2 = 2025$. This is the max of $k=22$ layer. $M_{22} = 2025$. This is at position $(22, -22)$.

The number 2026 is in the $k=23$ layer. Max value $M_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$. Coordinates in $[-23, 23] \times [-23, 23]$.

$M_{22} = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ (Bottom Right corner).
The spiral path from $M_{k-1}^2$ to $M_k^2$:
The $(2k+1) \times (2k+1)$ square has side length $s = 2k+1$.
The previous max was $M_{k-1} = (2k-1)^2$. It was at position $(k-1, -(k-1))$.

$k=1$: $M_0=1$ at (0, 0). $s=3$. $M_1=9$ at (1, -1). Path: $2 \xrightarrow{R} (1, 0)$, $3, 4 \xrightarrow{U} (1, 1), (0, 1)$, $5, 6, 7 \xrightarrow{L} (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1)$, $8, 9 \xrightarrow{D} (0, -1), (1, -1)$. (The example order is different).

Let's stick to the example structure:
... 5 4 3
... 6 1 2
... 7 8 9

$k=1$, $s=3$. Center (0, 0).
1 (0, 0)
2 (1, 0) (R)
3 (1, 1) (U)
4 (0, 1) (L)
5 (-1, 1)
6 (-1, 0)
7 (-1, -1) (BL)
8 (0, -1) (D)
9 (1, -1) (BR)

$k=2$, $s=5$. $M_1=9$ at (1, -1). Next number 10.
The side length increases by 2. $2k = 4$. The next path length is $2k+1 = 5$.
From (1, -1):
$10, 11, 12$ move Right (to x=2). (3 steps)
$10$ at (2, -1), $11$ at (2, 0), $12$ at (2, 1). Wait, the side length is 4 steps from corner to corner.
The length of the segment is $s-1 = 2k$. $2k=4$.
$9$ (1, -1). Moves right to $x=2$.
10 at (2, -1).
11 at (2, 0).
12 at (2, 1).
13 at (2, 2) (TR corner of $5 \times 5$ layer starting from 10). $M_2=25$ at (2, -2).

Let's re-examine the corners:
$s=3$: BR=9 (1, -1).
$s=5$: TR=13 (2, 2), TL=17 (-2, 2), BL=21 (-2, -2), BR=25 (2, -2).
The path from 9 (1, -1) to 25 (2, -2) involves 4 sides of length 4. $4 \times 4 = 16$ numbers (10 to 25).

From 9 (1, -1):
Side 1 (Right, to $x=2$): Length 4.
$10$ at (2, -1), $11$ at (2, 0), $12$ at (2, 1), $13$ at (2, 2) (TR).

Side 2 (Up, to $y=2$): Length 4. (Wait, 13 is TR, 17 is TL. Move Left).
From 13 (2, 2):
$14$ at (1, 2), $15$ at (0, 2), $16$ at (-1, 2), $17$ at (-2, 2) (TL).

Side 3 (Left, to $x=-2$): Length 4. (Move Down).
From 17 (-2, 2):
$18$ at (-2, 1), $19$ at (-2, 0), $20$ at (-2, -1), $21$ at (-2, -2) (BL).

Side 4 (Down, to $y=-2$): Length 4. (Move Right).
From 21 (-2, -2):
$22$ at (-1, -2), $23$ at (0, -2), $24$ at (1, -2), $25$ at (2, -2) (BR).

This confirms the structure: The number $N = (2k-1)^2$ is the BR corner $(k-1, -(k-1))$. The next number $(2k-1)^2 + 1$ starts the Right edge, moves towards $x=k$. The sequence of sides is: R, U, L, D. (Wait, the example shows 2(R), 3(U), 4,5(L), 6,7(D), 8,9(R)).

Let's re-examine the example:
1 at (0, 0).
2 (1, 0) [R]
3 (1, 1) [U]
4 (0, 1), 5 (-1, 1) [L]
6 (-1, 0), 7 (-1, -1) [D]
8 (0, -1), 9 (1, -1) [R] $\implies$ This means the path continues Right from 9.

$M_1 = 9$ at (1, -1). Side length $s=3$. $k=1$.
Next layer $s=5$, $k=2$. Path length $2k=4$.
From 9 (1, -1):
Side 1 (R, to $x=2$): $10, 11, 12, 13$. (4 steps)
$10$ (2, -1), $11$ (2, 0), $12$ (2, 1), $13$ (2, 2) (TR).

Side 2 (U, to $y=2$): $14, 15, 16, 17$. (4 steps) (Wait, 13 is TR, 17 is TL. Move Left).
From 13 (2, 2):
$14$ (1, 2), $15$ (0, 2), $16$ (-1, 2), $17$ (-2, 2) (TL).

Side 3 (L, to $x=-2$): $18, 19, 20, 21$. (4 steps) (Move Down).
From 17 (-2, 2):
$18$ (-2, 1), $19$ (-2, 0), $20$ (-2, -1), $21$ (-2, -2) (BL).

Side 4 (D, to $y=-2$): $22, 23, 24, 25$. (4 steps) (Move Right).
From 21 (-2, -2):
$22$ (-1, -2), $23$ (0, -2), $24$ (1, -2), $25$ (2, -2) (BR).

This confirms: From $M_{k-1}^2$ at $(k-1, -(k-1))$, the next number $M_{k-1}^2+1$ starts moving Right towards $x=k$.

We have $N = 2026$. $45^2 = 2025$. $k=23$. $s=47$.
$M_{22} = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ starts the $k=23$ layer, side length $2k = 46$.
$2026$ starts moving Right to $x=23$.

The path is: R, U, L, D. (4 sides of length 46).
$2026$ is on the Right side, moving towards $x=23$.
Position of 2026: $(23, y)$.
Since 2025 is at $(22, -22)$, the next step is Right to $(23, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This is the starting point of the Right edge segment.

The Right edge goes from $y=-22$ to $y=23$. (46 steps, $23 - (-22) = 45$ values including start/end).
No, the length of the side is $s-1 = 2k = 46$.
The segment covers 46 points.
From $(k, -(k-1))$ to $(k, k)$. $k - (-(k-1)) = 2k-1$ points. Wait, this must be 46 points.

$k=23$. Layer $23$. $x, y \in [-23, 23]$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
Side 1 (Right, increasing $x$ from 22 to 23):
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This is the first point on the edge $x=23$.

The side length $s-1 = 46$ refers to the number of steps between corners.
The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square:
TR: $(23, 23)$, TL: $(-23, 23)$, BL: $(-23, -23)$, BR: $(23, -23)$.
The path should move from $(22, -22)$ towards the TR corner $(23, 23)$.

Side 1 (R to $x=23$): Moves from $(22, -22)$ to $(23, -22)$. (1 step).
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.

Side 2 (U to $y=23$): From $(23, -22)$ to $(23, 23)$. (45 steps).
$2026, 2027, \dots, 2026+45 = 2071$.
$2071$ is at $(23, 23)$ (TR corner).

Side 3 (L to $x=-23$): From $(23, 23)$ to $(-23, 23)$. (46 steps).
$2072$ at $(22, 23)$, $\dots$, $2071 + 46 = 2117$ at $(-23, 23)$ (TL corner).

Side 4 (D to $y=-23$): From $(-23, 23)$ to $(-23, -23)$. (46 steps).
$2118$ at $(-23, 22)$, $\dots$, $2117 + 46 = 2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ (BL corner).

Side 5 (R to $x=23$): From $(-23, -23)$ to $(23, -23)$. (46 steps).
$2164$ at $(-22, -23)$, $\dots$, $2163 + 46 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$ (BR corner). $47^2 = 2209$.

The number $N=2026$ is the first number in this layer, located at coordinates $P_{2026} = (23, -22)$.

We need the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
$P_{2026} = (23, -22)$.
The neighbors are at $(x+\delta x, y+\delta y)$ where $\delta x, \delta y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $(\delta x, \delta y) \neq (0, 0)$.

Neighbors' coordinates $(\delta x, \delta y)$:
1. $(-1, -1) \implies (22, -23)$
2. $(0, -1) \implies (23, -23)$
3. $(1, -1) \implies (24, -23)$ (Outside the $47 \times 47$ grid, $x \le 23$)
4. $(-1, 0) \implies (22, -22)$
5. $(1, 0) \implies (24, -22)$ (Outside)
6. $(-1, 1) \implies (22, -21)$
7. $(0, 1) \implies (23, -21)$
8. $(1, 1) \implies (24, -21)$ (Outside)

The neighbors must be within the established grid boundaries $[-23, 23] \times [-23, 23]$.

1. $(22, -23)$: Belongs to the previous layer ($k=22$). $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
Side 4 (D) of $k=22$ ends at $2025$ at $(22, -22)$. The path to $2025$: $2163 \xrightarrow{R} 2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
Wait, $M_{22}=2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ (BR corner of $45 \times 45$).

Let's re-examine the position of $M_{22}=2025$:
$k=22$. $M_{22}=2025$ is BR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square, position $(22, -22)$.

The layer $k=23$ starts at $(23, -22)$ with 2026.
The neighbors of 2026 at $(23, -22)$:

1. $(-1, -1) \implies (22, -23)$. This is the bottom edge of the previous layer, $y=-22$. It must be in layer $k=22$ or the edge connecting $k=22$ and $k=23$.
The maximum $y$ for $k=22$ is $y=22$. The minimum $y$ is $y=-22$.
The number at $(22, -23)$ would be in the layer $k=23$ if $y=-23$ is a valid coordinate, which it is. This point is on the Bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ grid. This point belongs to the segment $2164, \dots, 2209$ (Side 5).
$2163$ is at $(-23, -23)$ (BL). $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$ (BR).
The point $(22, -23)$ is the number $2209 - (23 - 22) = 2208$.

2. $(0, -1) \implies (23, -23)$. This is the BR corner of the $47 \times 47$ square: $N = 2209$.

3. $(1, -1) \implies (24, -23)$. Outside the $47 \times 47$ grid. This neighbor must be in the next layer ($k=24$).

4. $(-1, 0) \implies (22, -22)$. This is the BR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square: $N = 2025$.

5. $(1, 0) \implies (24, -22)$. Outside.

6. $(-1, 1) \implies (22, -21)$. This point is on the Right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square, $x=22$.
The Right edge of $k=22$ (Side 1) goes from $(22, -21)$ to $(22, 22)$. (44 steps).
$2025 = (22, -22)$ is the end of Side 4 (Down) of $k=22$.
Let's trace the end of $k=21$ ($43^2 = 1849$ at $(21, -21)$).
$k=22$ starts at $(22, -21)$ with $1849+1 = 1850$.
$1850$ at $(22, -21)$.
Side 1 (R): $1850, \dots, 1850+44 = 1894$ at $(22, 22)$ (TR).

$1894$ at $(22, 22)$.
Side 2 (L): $1895, \dots, 1894+44 = 1938$ at $(-22, 22)$ (TL).
Side 3 (D): $1939, \dots, 1938+44 = 1982$ at $(-22, -22)$ (BL).
Side 4 (R): $1983, \dots, 1982+44 = 2026$? No, $2025$. $1982+43 = 2025$. (43 steps from BL to BR).
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$ (BR). This matches $45^2$.
So, $N_{22, -21} = 1850$. This neighbor is $N = 1850$.

7. $(0, 1) \implies (23, -21)$. This is on the Right edge of $k=23$, which starts at $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$N_{23, -21} = 2026 + 1 = 2027$.

8. $(1, 1) \implies (24, -21)$. Outside.

We need to identify the neighbors that are *inside* the $47 \times 47$ grid defined by $k=23$. The 8 neighbors must exist. If one neighbor falls outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary, it must be the number $2209+1$, or $2209+2$, etc.
Since 2026 is in the layer $k=23$, its 8 neighbors can be in layer $k=22$, $k=23$, or $k=24$.

The neighbors are:
4. $N_{22, -22} = 2025$. (Previous layer)
6. $N_{22, -21} = 1850$. (Previous layer)
7. $N_{23, -21} = 2027$. (Same layer, next number)
2. $N_{23, -23} = 2208$. (Same layer, on the bottom edge)

We need $N_{22, -23}$, $N_{24, \cdot, \cdot}$.

$N_{22, -23}$: This point is outside the $45 \times 45$ square ($y \ge -22$). This point must belong to the $47 \times 47$ square.
As calculated before, $N_{23, -23} = 2209$.
$N_{23, -23} = 2209$.
$N_{22, -23}$: If we trace the spiral backwards from 2025, we go to 1983 at $(-22, -22)$.
The point $(22, -23)$ is on the bottom edge $y=-23$, where numbers increase to the right ($2164, \dots, 2209$).
$N_{23, -23} = 2209$. $N_{23, -22} = 2026$. This path is wrong.

Let's re-establish the coordinates for $N_{2026} = (23, -22)$.
The bottom row $y=-23$ is covered by $\{2164, \dots, 2209\}$.
$2209$ at $(23, -23)$ (BR). $2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ (BL).
The order is increasing $x$.
$N_{23, -23} = 2209 - (23 - x)$.
If $x=22$, $N = 2209 - 1 = 2208$. This is $N_{22, -23}$? No, $x=22$ is in $k=23$.
$N_{23, -22} = 2026$.
$N_{23, -23} = 2209$. This is a jump of $2209 - 2026 = 183$. This implies the path is not simple.

The segment $2164$ to $2209$ (Side 5, Right) is from $(-23, -23)$ to $(23, -23)$.
$2163$ at $(-23, -23)$. No, $2163$ is BL corner.
$2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ (BL). $2209$ at $(23, -23)$ (BR).
The numbers increase from left to right on the bottom edge.
$N_{2163, -23} = 2163$.
$N_{23, -23} = 2209$.

Let's re-check Side 4 (D): From $(-23, 23)$ to $(-23, -23)$.
$2117$ at $(-23, 23)$ (TL). $2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ (BL).
$2117 + 46 = 2163$. This is correct.

Side 5 (R): From $(-23, -23)$ to $(23, -23)$. 46 steps.
$2164$ at $(-22, -23)$. $\dots$ $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
$2164 + (x - (-23)) - 1 = N$.
$2164 + x + 23 - 1 = N$. $N = x + 2186$.
If $x=22$, $N = 2208$. This is $N_{22, -23}$. (This point is in the $k=23$ layer).

Neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$:
1. $(22, -23)$: $N = 22 + 2186 = 2208$.
2. $(23, -23)$: $N = 23 + 2186 = 2209$. (BR Corner)
3. $(24, -23)$: Outside, $N_{24, -23}$. This must be $47^2 + 1 = 2210$. (Start of $k=24$ layer).

4. $(22, -22)$: $2025$. (Previous Layer)
5. $(24, -22)$: Outside, $47^2 + 2 = 2211$. (Start of next layer).

6. $(22, -21)$: $1850$. (Previous Layer)
7. $(23, -21)$: $2027$. (Same Layer)
8. $(24, -21)$: Outside, $47^2 + 3 = 2212$.

The neighbors must be the 8 numbers immediately surrounding 2026 in the grid, regardless of layer.

The 8 neighbors are:
$N_1 = 2208$ (from position $(22, -23)$)
$N_2 = 2209$ (from position $(23, -23)$)
$N_3 = 2210$ (hypothetical, next number on the next layer)
$N_4 = 2025$ (from position $(22, -22)$)
$N_5 = 2211$ (hypothetical)
$N_6 = 1850$ (from position $(22, -21)$)
$N_7 = 2027$ (from position $(23, -21)$)
$N_8 = 2212$ (hypothetical)

Since the problem is about the sum of all 8 neighbors, the numbers that fall outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary (i.e., on the $x=24$ column) must be the first few numbers of the next layer ($k=24$).
$47^2 = 2209$.
$N_{24, y} = 2209 + \delta$.

$N_3 = 2209 + 1 = 2210$.
$N_5 = 2209 + 2 = 2211$.
$N_8 = 2209 + 3 = 2212$.

The 8 neighbors are: $\{2208, 2209, 2210, 2025, 2211, 1850, 2027, 2212\}$.

Sum $S = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212$.
$S = (2025 + 2027) + (1850 + 2208) + (2210 + 2211 + 2212) + 2209$.
$S = 4052 + 4058 + 6633 + 2209$.
$S = 8110 + 8842 = 16952$.

Final check of the sum:
$2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952$.
