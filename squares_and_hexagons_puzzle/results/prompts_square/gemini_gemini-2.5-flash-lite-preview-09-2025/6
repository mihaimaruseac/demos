Solution:
The problem asks for the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a Ulam spiral laid out on a square grid.

First, we need to determine the location of the number 2026 in the spiral. The spiral is built in layers around the center number 1. The side length of the square layer containing the number $n$ can be determined by finding the smallest odd integer $2k+1$ such that $n \le (2k+1)^2$. The side length of the square is $s = 2k+1$, and the largest number in this layer is $s^2$.

We find the smallest odd square greater than or equal to 2026:
$40^2 = 1600$
$45^2 = 2025$
$46^2 = 2116$

Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2025 is the top-right corner (the end of the $45 \times 45$ square layer).
The side length of the square layer containing 2026 is $s = 47$. The largest number in this layer is $47^2 = 2209$.

The spiral is constructed in layers. The numbers in the layer corresponding to $s=2k+1$ range from $(2k-1)^2 + 1$ to $(2k+1)^2$.
For $s=47$, we have $2k+1 = 47$, so $2k = 46$, and $k=23$.
The previous square is $(2k-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
The numbers in the $47 \times 47$ layer start at $2025 + 1 = 2026$ and end at $2209$.

The number $n$ is on the layer with side length $s$. Its coordinates $(x, y)$ are relative to the center $(0, 0)$ where 1 is located. The coordinates of the corners of the $s \times s$ square are $(\pm k, \pm k)$, where $s = 2k+1$.
For $s=47$, $k=23$. The corners are at $(\pm 23, \pm 23)$.

The number $s^2 = 2209$ is at $(23, -23)$ (bottom-right corner, as the spiral moves counter-clockwise).
The sides of the square are of length $s-1 = 46$.

The side ending at $s^2$ is the bottom side, moving right to left (from $x=23$ to $x=-23$).
$2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.
The bottom side is $y = -23$. The $x$ coordinate changes from $23$ down to $-23$.
The numbers on the bottom side are:
$2209, 2208, \ldots$
The bottom-right corner $(23, -23)$ is $47^2 = 2209$.
The bottom-left corner $(-23, -23)$ is $47^2 - 46 = 2163$.

The side before the bottom side is the right side, moving up.
The top-right corner $(23, 23)$ is $43^2 + 46 \times 2 = 1849 + 92 = 1941$ (No, this is incorrect).
Let's use the standard convention for the Ulam spiral construction:
1 is at $(0, 0)$.
Layer $k$ has side length $2k+1$. The numbers go from $(2k-1)^2 + 1$ to $(2k+1)^2$.
The coordinates of the corners of the $s \times s$ square are $(\pm k, \pm k)$.

$s=3$ ($k=1$): $2^2+1=5$ to $3^2=9$. $9$ is at $(1, -1)$ (Bottom-Right).
$s=5$ ($k=2$): $4^2+1=17$ to $5^2=25$. $25$ is at $(2, -2)$ (Bottom-Right).
In general, $(2k+1)^2$ is at $(k, -k)$.

For $s=47$, $k=23$. $47^2 = 2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.

The sides are traversed in the order: Left, Up, Right, Down (for the outermost layer).
The path for the $s=47$ layer starts after $45^2 = 2025$, which is at $(-22, -23)$ (the point just before the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square, but the path continues from the $45 \times 45$ outer boundary).

Let's trace the path starting from $45^2 = 2025$ at $(-22, -22)$.
The number $2026$ starts the $47 \times 47$ layer.

1. The spiral moves right from $45^2=2025$ at $(-22, -22)$ to $2026$ at $(-22, -21)$. (This is the path from the previous layer's end point).
   However, the standard Ulam spiral goes:
   $1$ at $(0, 0)$.
   $2$ at $(1, 0)$ (Right).
   $3$ at $(1, 1)$ (Up).
   $4$ at $(0, 1)$ (Left).
   $5$ at $(-1, 1)$ (Left).
   $6$ at $(-1, 0)$ (Down).
   $7$ at $(-1, -1)$ (Down).
   $8$ at $(0, -1)$ (Right).
   $9$ at $(1, -1)$ (Right).

For $s=47$, $k=23$. The last number of the inner layer is $45^2 = 2025$.
The location of $45^2 = 2025$ is $(-22, -22)$.

The path to go to the $47 \times 47$ square:
From $(-22, -22)$, the spiral moves right by 1 step to $(-22, -21)$? No, the next number is on the border.
The corner $(-22, -22)$ is $45^2=2025$.
The path moves right to $(-21, -22)$? No, the spiral turns.

The side length $s=2k+1$. The numbers on the border of the $s \times s$ square start one step away from the inner square border.
The number $(2k-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ is at the corner $(-22, -22)$.
The next step is Right, to $(-21, -22)$. This is wrong based on the drawing.

Let's follow the drawing:
1 at $(0, 0)$.
2 at $(1, 0)$ (R).
3 at $(1, 1)$ (U).
4 at $(0, 1)$ (L).
5 at $(-1, 1)$ (L).
6 at $(-1, 0)$ (D).
7 at $(-1, -1)$ (D).
8 at $(0, -1)$ (R).
9 at $(1, -1)$ (R). (Corner of $3 \times 3$ square).

The next side is Up, length 2.
10 at $(1, 0)$ (U). Wait, 2 is at $(1, 0)$.
The path is counter-clockwise (CCW).

Layer $k=1$ ($s=3$): $2^2+1=5$ to $9$.
$4$ is at $(0, 1)$. $5$ is at $(-1, 1)$. (Left side)
$6$ is at $(-1, 0)$. (Down side)
$7$ is at $(-1, -1)$. (Down side)
$8$ is at $(0, -1)$. (Right side)
$9$ is at $(1, -1)$. (Right side) (Bottom-Right Corner)

Layer $k=2$ ($s=5$): $4^2+1=17$ to $25$. $16$ is at $(1, 0)$.
The path starts from $16$ at $(1, 0)$ which is the Rightmost point of the $3 \times 3$ square boundary.
The path for $s=5$ should start from the point adjacent to $16$ on the new layer boundary.
$16$ is at $(1, 0)$. The next number $17$ must be on the $5 \times 5$ boundary.

The coordinates for the corners of the $s \times s$ square ($s=2k+1$) are $(\pm k, \pm k)$.
$s^2$ is at $(k, -k)$ (Bottom-Right).

$45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.

The side length $s=47$, $k=23$. The layer starts at $2026$.
The spiral moves from the inner square's boundary.
The number $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The next number $2026$ must be one step away from $2025$ along the new layer boundary.

From $(22, -22)$, the path moves:
1. Right: $(23, -22)$ - This is on the right edge.
2. Up: $(23, -21), (23, -20), \ldots, (23, 22)$. (Length $46$)
3. Left: $(22, 23), (21, 23), \ldots, (-22, 23)$. (Length $46$)
4. Down: $(-23, 22), (-23, 21), \ldots, (-23, -22)$. (Length $46$)
5. Left: $(-22, -23), (-21, -23), \ldots, (22, -23)$. (Length $46$)

Let's check the coordinates:
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$ (Right side, starting the Upward movement).

Side 1: Right edge, $x=23$. Moves Up from $y=-22$ to $y=23$. Length $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps.
The numbers are $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2026 + 45 = 2071$.
$2071$ is at $(23, 23)$ (Top-Right Corner).

Side 2: Top edge, $y=23$. Moves Left from $x=23$ to $x=-23$. Length $23 - (-23) = 46$ steps.
$2072$ is at $(22, 23)$.
The numbers are $2072, \ldots, 2072 + 45 = 2117$.
$2117$ is at $(-23, 23)$ (Top-Left Corner).

Side 3: Left edge, $x=-23$. Moves Down from $y=23$ to $y=-23$. Length $46$ steps.
$2118$ is at $(-23, 22)$.
The numbers are $2118, \ldots, 2118 + 45 = 2163$.
$2163$ is at $(-23, -23)$ (Bottom-Left Corner).

Side 4: Bottom edge, $y=-23$. Moves Right from $x=-23$ to $x=23$. Length $46$ steps.
$2164$ is at $(-22, -23)$.
The numbers are $2164, \ldots, 2164 + 44 = 2208$.
$2208$ is at $(22, -23)$.
The last number of the layer is $47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$ (Bottom-Right Corner).

We need to locate $n=2026$.
$2026$ is the first number in this layer, located at $(x_n, y_n) = (23, -22)$.

The 8 neighbors of $(x_n, y_n)$ are:
$(x_n+dx, y_n+dy)$ where $dx, dy \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $(dx, dy) \neq (0, 0)$.

Coordinates of 2026: $P = (23, -22)$.
Neighbors' coordinates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_1 = (23-1, -22-1) = (22, -23)$: This is $2164$.
    \item $N_2 = (23, -22-1) = (23, -23)$: This is $2209$.
    \item $N_3 = (23+1, -22-1) = (24, -23)$: This is outside the $47 \times 47$ square boundary. This point must belong to the next layer's boundary.
    \item $N_4 = (23-1, -22) = (22, -22)$: This is $2025$.
    \item $N_5 = (23+1, -22) = (24, -22)$: Outside.
    \item $N_6 = (23-1, -22+1) = (22, -21)$: This is $2024$.
    \item $N_7 = (23, -22+1) = (23, -21)$: This is $2027$.
    \item $N_8 = (23+1, -22+1) = (24, -21)$: Outside.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors of $n$ must be numbers present in the spiral. In an open grid, the neighbors are determined by their coordinates relative to $n$. The neighbors of a number $n$ in the spiral are its 8 surrounding cells in the grid.

The coordinates for $n=2026$ are $(23, -22)$.

The values at the neighboring coordinates are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23)$: This is on the bottom edge, $y=-23$. This is $2164$.
    \item $(23, -23)$: This is the bottom-right corner, $47^2 = 2209$.
    \item $(24, -23)$: This coordinate belongs to the $49 \times 49$ layer.
    \item $(22, -22)$: This is $2025$.
    \item $(24, -22)$: This coordinate belongs to the $49 \times 49$ layer.
    \item $(22, -21)$: This is on the right edge, $x=23$. Since $2026$ is the first on the right edge, the previous one is on the previous side.
          The numbers on the right edge are $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2071$.
          $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
          $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$.
          $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
          The number at $(22, -21)$ is $2025 - 1 = 2024$ (from the $45 \times 45$ layer trace).
    \item $(23, -21)$: This is $2027$.
    \item $(24, -21)$: Outside.
\end{enumerate}

The numbers that are neighbors of 2026 are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2025$ (at $(22, -22)$)
    \item $2027$ (at $(23, -21)$)
    \item $2024$ (at $(22, -21)$)
    \item $2164$ (at $(22, -23)$)
    \item $2209$ (at $(23, -23)$)
\end{itemize}
The neighbors that fall outside the $47 \times 47$ layer boundary defined by $k=23$ are $(24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)$. These points belong to the next layer, $k=24$, side length $49$.

The neighbors of a number $n$ are the 8 numbers whose grid cells surround the cell containing $n$. These numbers are simply the values in the adjacent cells.

The neighbors are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23)$: $2164$ (Bottom-Left of 2026's $2 \times 2$ block, part of the previous side's end)
    \item $(23, -23)$: $2209$ (Bottom-Right corner)
    \item $(24, -23)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ area, belongs to the $49 \times 49$ area.
    \item $(22, -22)$: $2025$ (Previous number)
    \item $(24, -22)$: Outside.
    \item $(22, -21)$: $2024$
    \item $(23, -21)$: $2027$ (Next number on the same side)
    \item $(24, -21)$: Outside.
\end{enumerate}

The question implies a standard square grid arrangement where every number has 8 neighbors, even if it's on the edge of the considered area. The neighbors are the numbers in the 8 adjacent cells.

If $P=(x, y)$ is the location of $n$, its neighbors are at $(x+dx, y+dy)$ for $dx, dy \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, $(dx, dy) \neq (0, 0)$. The values at these locations are the neighbors, regardless of which layer they belong to.

The coordinates of the neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -23)$: This is $2164$.
    \item $(23, -23)$: This is $2209$.
    \item $(24, -23)$: This is on the right side of the $47 \times 47$ square, it is the next layer's $(23, -23)$ position, which is $2209 + 1 = 2210$ if the path continues right. No, it's the next layer $49 \times 49$.
    \item $(22, -22)$: $2025$.
    \item $(24, -22)$: Next layer.
    \item $(22, -21)$: $2024$.
    \item $(23, -21)$: $2027$.
    \item $(24, -21)$: Next layer.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors must belong to the set of natural numbers. The spiral covers all natural numbers. The cell $(x, y)$ contains a unique natural number.

We need the numbers at:
$N_1 = (22, -23)$. This is on the bottom side of the $47 \times 47$ square. The rightmost of this side is $(22, -23)$. The bottom side goes from $(-22, -23)$ to $(22, -23)$, length 45.
$2164$ is at $(-22, -23)$. $2208$ is at $(22, -23)$. So $N_1 = 2208$.

$N_2 = (23, -23)$: $2209$.

$N_3 = (24, -23)$: This is outside the $47 \times 47$ square. It's on the $(49 \times 49)$ layer, $k=24$.
$47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. The next layer starts from $2209+1=2210$.
The path continues right: $2210$ at $(24, -23)$. So $N_3 = 2210$.

$N_4 = (22, -22)$: $2025$.

$N_5 = (24, -22)$: This is on the right edge ($x=24$) of the next layer. The right edge of $47 \times 47$ ends at $(23, 23)$. The next point $(24, -22)$ is not easy to determine immediately.

Let's use the property that for any $n$ not on a corner, its neighbors are $n \pm 1, n \pm (2k+1), n \pm (2k+2)$.
Since $2026$ is not a corner, we are in the middle of a side.
$2026$ is on the Right side, $x=23$, $y$ from $-22$ to $23$.
The previous number is $2025$ (at $(22, -22)$).
The next number is $2027$ (at $(23, -21)$).
The side length is $s=47$, so $2k+1 = 47$. The size of the previous layer was $45 \times 45$. The difference between the start of the side and the end of the previous side is related to $2k$.

The distance between the centers of the side where $n$ lies and the opposite side is $2k = 46$.
The distance to the corresponding number on the opposite side is $2(2k) = 92$.

$P = (23, -22)$. $n=2026$.
Opposite side is the Left side, $x=-23$. The corresponding $y$ is $-22$.
The number at $(-23, -22)$ is $2163 - 1 = 2162$ from the calculation above ($2163$ is at $(-23, -23)$).
Let's recheck the corners:
$2117$ at $(-23, 23)$.
$2163$ at $(-23, -23)$.
$2118$ is at $(-23, 22)$.
The left side: $y$ goes from $22$ to $-23$. Steps: $22 - (-23) = 45$.
$2118 + 45 = 2163$. This is correct.
$2163$ is at $(-23, -23)$.
$2162$ is at $(-23, -22)$. So $N_6 = 2162$.

The number diagonally opposite to $n$ across the center of the square is not well-defined.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is:
$S = (2025 + 2027) + (2024 + 2026) + (\text{other 4 neighbors})$.
The sum of the 8 neighbors of $n$ is $8n$ plus the sum of the differences $\sum (n_i - n)$.

The neighbors are:
$n_{-1, -1} = 2025$ (Previous)
$n_{0, -1} = 2162$ (Opposite side's corresponding point)
$n_{1, -1}$: Outside, $2210$.

$n_{-1, 0} = 2024$
$n_{1, 0}$: Outside, $2211$.

$n_{-1, 1} = 2027$ (Next)
$n_{0, 1} = 2027$ (Wait, $(23, -21)$ is $2027$. $(22, -21)$ is $2024$. $(24, -21)$ is $2211$ or $2212$).

Let's use the general formula for the sum of neighbors, based on the layer $k$:
If $n$ is on a side, its neighbors are $n \pm 1$, $n \pm (2k+1)$, $n \pm (2k+2)$, and the two numbers on the corners. (This is for $n$ on the side of length $2k$).

Since $2026$ is near the beginning of a side, its neighbors are close in value.
$2024$ at $(22, -21)$, $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$.

$N = \{2024, 2025, 2027, 2162, 2208, 2209, 2210, \text{one more}\}$.

The 8 neighbors are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23)$: $2208$
    \item $(23, -23)$: $2209$
    \item $(24, -23)$: $2210$ (Next number in the sequence, if it were on the right edge).
    \item $(22, -22)$: $2025$
    \item $(24, -22)$: This is $(23+1, -22)$. This cell is on the $49 \times 49$ layer.
          The $49 \times 49$ layer starts at $2210$ at $(24, -23)$. The path moves Up.
          $2211$ at $(24, -22)$.
    \item $(22, -21)$: $2024$
    \item $(23, -21)$: $2027$
    \item $(24, -21)$: $2212$.
\end{enumerate}

The sum of the 8 neighbors is:
$S = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 2024 + 2027 + 2212$
$S = (2024 + 2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)$

Sum of the smaller three: $2024 + 2025 + 2027 = 6076$.
Sum of the larger five: $5 \times 2210 + (-2 - 1 + 0 + 1 + 2) = 5 \times 2210 = 11050$.

$S = 6076 + 11050 = 17126$.

Final check of the values:
$2024$ at $(22, -21)$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$.

$2208$ at $(22, -23)$.
$2209$ at $(23, -23)$.

$2210$ at $(24, -23)$ (Start of $49 \times 49$ layer, moving up).
$2211$ at $(24, -22)$.
$2212$ at $(24, -21)$.

Sum $S = (2024 + 2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)$
$S = 6076 + 11050 = 17126$.
