To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we can analyze the pattern of the spiral to determine the positions of the neighbors relative to 2026.

First, let's determine the position of 2026 in the spiral. The spiral is laid out in layers, with each layer containing an odd number of cells on each side (1, 3, 5, etc.). We can find the layer that 2026 is in by successively subtracting the squares of odd numbers until we reach a number less than the square of the next odd number.

Starting with 2026, we subtract the squares of odd numbers:

- 2026 - 1^2 = 2025 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 3^2 = 2017 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 5^2 = 2001 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 7^2 = 1985 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 9^2 = 1957 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 11^2 = 1925 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 13^2 = 1893 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 15^2 = 1861 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 17^2 = 1829 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 19^2 = 1797 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 21^2 = 1765 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 23^2 = 1733 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 25^2 = 1701 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 27^2 = 1669 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 29^2 = 1637 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 31^2 = 1605 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 33^2 = 1573 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 35^2 = 1541 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 37^2 = 1509 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 39^2 = 1477 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 41^2 = 1445 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 43^2 = 1413 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 45^2 = 1381 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 47^2 = 1349 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 49^2 = 1317 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 51^2 = 1285 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 53^2 = 1253 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 55^2 = 1221 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 57^2 = 1189 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 59^2 = 1157 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 61^2 = 1125 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 63^2 = 1093 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 65^2 = 1061 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 67^2 = 1029 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 69^2 = 997 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 71^2 = 965 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 73^2 = 933 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 75^2 = 901 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 77^2 = 869 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 79^2 = 837 (not enough to subtract the next square)
- 2026 - 81^2 = 805

Now we know that 2026 is in the layer that starts with 805 + 1 = 806 and ends with 81^2 = 6561. To find the position of 2026 within this layer, we can calculate the distance from the start of the layer:

2026 - 806 = 1220

Since each side of this layer has 81 numbers, we can find the position of 2026 along the side of the square by taking the remainder of 1220 divided by 81:

1220 % 81 = 49

Now, we need to determine if 2026 is on a corner, edge, or in the middle of the side. Since 49 is not 0, 80, or a multiple of 81, it is not on a corner. Since 49 is not exactly in the middle of 81 (which would be 40 or 41), it is on an edge. Specifically, it is on the 49th position from the start of the side, which is the bottom edge in this case because 2026 is in the first half of the numbers in the layer.

The 8 neighbors of a number on the edge (but not on a corner) are as follows:

- The two numbers on the same edge (left and right)
- The two numbers on the adjacent edges (above and below)
- The four numbers on the corners of the 3x3 block that the number is a part of (above left, above right, below left, below right)

Let's find each of these neighbors:

1. Left neighbor: 2026 - 1 = 2025
2. Right neighbor: 2026 + 1 = 2027
3. Above neighbor: Since 2026 is on the bottom edge, going up one row would take us to the last number of the previous row. The last number of the previous row is 806 + 79 (since 2026 is the 49th number on its row, and the row has 81 numbers). So, 806 + 79 = 885.
4. Below neighbor: Since 2026 is on the bottom edge, going down one row would take us to the first number of the next row. The first number of the next row is 806 + 80 (since 2026 is the 49th number on its row, and the row has 81 numbers). So, 806 + 80 = 886.
5. Above left neighbor: We need to go up one row and left one column from 2026. Since we are on the bottom edge, we can't go directly up and left without skipping a number, so we actually go up one row and then left to the last number of that row. This takes us to the last number of the row above, which we already calculated as 885.
6. Above right neighbor: We need to go up one row and right one column from 2026. This takes us to the first number of the row above, which is 886.
7. Below left neighbor: We need to go down one row and left one column from 2026. This takes us to the last number of the row below, which is 2026 + 80 (since 2026 is the 49th number on its row, and the row has 81 numbers). So, 2026 + 80 = 2106.
8. Below right neighbor: We need to go down one row and right one column from 2026. This takes us to the first number of the row below, which is 2026 + 81 (since 2026 is the 49th number on its row, and the row has 81 numbers). So, 2026 + 81 = 2107.

Now we can sum these neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 885 + 886 + 885 + 886 + 2106 + 2107 = 12907

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 12907.
