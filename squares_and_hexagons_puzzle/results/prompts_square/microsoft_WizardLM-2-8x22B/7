To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine where 2026 lies on the spiral. The spiral starts at 1 and then moves in a square pattern, incrementing by 1 each step.

The pattern of the spiral is as follows:

1. Start at the center (number 1).
2. Move right to the next number (2).
3. Move up to the next number (3).
4. Move left to the next number (4).
5. Move down to the next number (5).
6. Repeat steps 2-5, but each time you change direction, move one more step in that direction than you did the last time you moved in that direction.

To find the position of 2026, we can simulate this process. However, instead of doing this step by step, we can recognize that each complete loop around the spiral (four sides of the square) increases the count by 8, 12, 16, etc. This is because each side of the square is 1, 2, 3, etc. numbers longer than the previous side.

Let's find out in which loop and on which side 2026 lies:

1. Calculate the number of complete loops:
   Each loop contains 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 numbers.
   The nth loop will contain 8n additional numbers (since each side of the square grid increases by 1).
   Let's find the largest n such that 10n + (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2) <= 2026.

2. We need to find the sum of the first n squares, which is given by the formula (n(n + 1)(2n + 1))/6.
   We can use this to find n by solving the inequality:

   (n(n + 1)(2n + 1))/6 + 10n <= 2026

   This inequality requires a bit of trial and error or iterative calculations to solve for n. We can start with a guess and adjust until we find the largest n that satisfies the condition.

3. Once we find n, we can determine the exact position of 2026 within the loop by calculating the remaining numbers after the last complete loop:

   remaining = 2026 - (10n + (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2))

4. Depending on the remainder, we can determine the position of 2026 on the current side of the spiral (top, right, bottom, or left) and which neighbors it has.

5. After finding the position of 2026, we can then find its 8 neighbors: above, below, left, right, and the four diagonal directions.

Let's calculate the value of n:

Starting with n = 40 (since 2026 is roughly 2000 and 2000/10 = 200, and we have to account for the sum of squares which grows faster than n):

For n = 40:
(40(40 + 1)(2*40 + 1))/6 + 10*40 = 11480/6 + 400 = 1913.33 + 400 = 2313.33

This is too high, so we need to try a lower number.

For n = 39:
(39(39 + 1)(2*39 + 1))/6 + 10*39 = 39*40*79/6 + 390 = 38760/6 + 390 = 6460 + 390 = 6850

This is still too high. We continue this process until we find the largest n such that the sum is less than or equal to 2026.

After some calculations, we find that for n = 30:
(30(30 + 1)(2*30 + 1))/6 + 10*30 = 30*31*61/6 + 300 = 18915/6 + 300 = 3152.5 + 300 = 3452.5

And for n = 29:
(29(29 + 1)(2*29 + 1))/6 + 10*29 = 29*30*59/6 + 290 = 16950/6 + 290 = 2825 + 290 = 3115

Now, for n = 30, the sum is less than 2026, and for n = 31:
(31(31 + 1)(2*31 + 1))/6 + 10*31 = 31*32*63/6 + 310 = 19544/6 + 310 = 3257.33 + 310 = 3567.33

So, 2026 is within the 31st loop. Now we calculate the remaining numbers after the last complete loop (n = 30):

remaining = 2026 - (10*30 + (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 30^2))
remaining = 2026 - (300 + 3152.5)
remaining = 2026 - 3452.5
remaining = -1426.5

This is incorrect because the sum of the first 31 loops should be less than 2026. We made a mistake in our calculation for the sum of the first 30 squares. Let's correct that:

(30(30 + 1)(2*30 + 1))/6 = 30*31*61/6 = 18615/6 = 3102.5

Now, let's find the correct n:

For n = 31:
(31(31 + 1)(2*31 + 1))/6 + 10*31 = 31*32*63/6 + 310 = 19872/6 + 310 = 3312 + 310 = 3622

This is too high, so we go back to n = 30:

remaining = 2026 - (10*30 + (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 30^2))
remaining = 2026 - (300 + 3102.5)
remaining = 2026 - 3402.5
remaining = -1376.5

This value is negative, which means we went too far. We need to find the remaining numbers after the 30th complete loop, not the 31st. Let's correct the remaining calculation for n = 30:

remaining = 2026 - (10*30 + sum of squares up to 30^2)
remaining = 2026 - (300 + 3102.5)
remaining = 2026 - 3402.5
remaining = -1376.5

This is still incorrect because the sum of the first 30 squares is incorrect (we have calculated it as 3102.5, which is incorrect). Let's correct the sum of the first 30 squares:

sum of squares up to 30^2 = (30(30 + 1)(2*30 + 1))/6 = (30*31*61)/6 = 18360/6 = 3060

Now, let's find the correct remaining number after the 30th loop:

remaining = 2026 - (10*30 + sum of squares up to 30^2)
remaining = 2026 - (300 + 3060)
remaining = 2026 - 3360
remaining = -1334

This is still incorrect because we are not supposed to have a negative number. We need to find the correct n that gives us a non-negative remainder. Let's try n = 31 again and find the correct sum of squares up to 31^2:

sum of squares up to 31^2 = (31(31 + 1)(2*31 + 1))/6 = (31*32*63)/6 = 19872/6 = 3312

Now, let's calculate the remaining numbers after the 31st loop:

remaining = 2026 - (10*31 + sum of squares up to 31^2)
remaining = 2026 - (310 + 3312)
remaining = 2026 - 3622
remaining = -1596

This is still incorrect because the sum of the first 31 loops plus the sum of squares up to 31^2 exceeds 2026. We need to find the exact n such that when we add the sum of the first n loops and the sum of squares up to n^2, we get a remainder that is less than the length of the loop side, which is n + 1.

Let's try n = 30 again and find the correct sum of squares up to 30^2:
