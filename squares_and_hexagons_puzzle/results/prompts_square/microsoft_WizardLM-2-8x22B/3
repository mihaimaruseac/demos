To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral. The spiral is laid out in such a way that it starts at the center with the number 1, and each subsequent natural number is placed in the next position on the spiral, which moves outward in a square fashion.

The spiral progresses as follows:

1. Start at the center with 1.
2. Move right to 2.
3. Move down to 3.
4. Move left to 4.
5. Move up to 5, which is back at the center.
6. Move right to 6, starting the next layer of the spiral.
7. Continue in this fashion, with each layer of the spiral being one step longer than the previous layer.

To find 2026, we need to determine which layer it is on and its position within that layer. We can do this by calculating the square root of 2026 and finding the largest integer less than or equal to it, which gives us the size of the largest complete square within the spiral up to 2026.

The largest complete square less than or equal to 2026 is 44^2 = 1936, which is 44 squares along each side. This means that 2026 is on the 45th layer of the spiral (since we start counting layers from 1).

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within the 45th layer. Since the 44th layer ends with 1936, the 45th layer starts with 1937. The numbers in the 45th layer will fill up the right side of the square, the top side, the left side, and finally the bottom side, before reaching the next corner at 2025. Therefore, 2026 is the first number on the bottom side of the 45th layer.

The layout of the numbers on the 45th layer just before 2026 is as follows:

```
... 2009 2010 2011 ...
... 2008 2025 2012 ...
... 2007 2024 2013 ...
... 2006 2023 2014 ...
... 2005 2022 2015 ...
... 2004 2021 2016 ...
... 2003 2020 2017 ...
... 2002 2019 2018 ...
```

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, left, right, and diagonally adjacent to it:

- Above: 2018
- Above right: 2017
- Right: 2016
- Below right: 2027
- Below: 2025
- Below left: 2015
- Left: 2005
- Above left: 2006

Now we can sum these numbers:

2018 + 2017 + 2016 + 2027 + 2025 + 2015 + 2005 + 2006 = 16043

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16043.
