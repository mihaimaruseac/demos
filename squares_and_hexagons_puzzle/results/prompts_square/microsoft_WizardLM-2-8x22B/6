To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its neighbors.

The spiral of natural numbers is laid out as follows:

```
... 17 16 15 ...
... 18  5 14 ...
... 19  4  3 ...
... 20  1  2 ...
... 21  8 13 ...
... 22  7  6 ...
... 23 12 11 ...
... 24 19 18 ...
... 25 10  9 ...
... 30 31 32 ...
```

We can see that the natural numbers increase in a counter-clockwise spiral, with each segment of the spiral having more numbers than the previous one. The first segment has 1 number, the second has 3, the third has 5, and so on, with the number of elements in each segment increasing by 2 each time.

To find the segment that contains 2026, we need to determine which segment it would fall into by calculating the cumulative sum of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, ... until we reach or exceed 2026.

Let's find the segment:

1^2 = 1
1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30
...

We can see that the sum of the first n odd numbers gives us the cumulative sum of the first n segments. The nth odd number is (2n - 1), and the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.

We want to find n such that:

n^2 < 2026 ≤ (n + 1)^2

Let's find n by trial and error:

41^2 = 1681
42^2 = 1764
43^2 = 1849
44^2 = 1936
45^2 = 2025
46^2 = 2116

We see that 2026 is between 45^2 and 46^2. Therefore, 2026 is in the 46th segment of the spiral.

Now, we need to determine how far into the 46th segment 2026 is. We calculate the difference:

2026 - 45^2 = 2026 - 2025 = 1

So, 2026 is the first number in the 46th segment.

Since each segment is a square, the number directly above the first number in a segment is the last number of the previous segment. Therefore, the number directly above 2026 is 2025. Similarly, the number to the left of 2026 is the last number of the segment before the previous one, which is 45^2 - 45 + 1 = 2025 - 44 = 1981.

Continuing this pattern, we can find the other neighbors:

- The number to the left of 1981 is 1981 - 1 = 1980.
- The number below 1980 is 1980 - 44 = 1936 (which is 44^2).
- The number to the right of 1936 is 1936 + 1 = 1937.
- The numbers to the right of 2026 are 2026 + 1 = 2027 and 2026 + 2 = 2028.
- The number below 2026 is 2026 + 45 = 2071.

Now we can sum all the neighbors of 2026:

2025 (above) + 1981 (left) + 1980 (further left) + 1936 (below left) + 1937 (below) + 2027 (right) + 2028 (further right) + 2071 (below) = 14005

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \boxed{14005}.

The answer is: 14005.
