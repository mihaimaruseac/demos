To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its neighbors.

Let's visualize how the numbers are laid out in the spiral:

```
... 24 23 22 21 ...
... 25 17 16 20 ...
... 26 18 3  19 ...
... 27 19 2  18 ...
... 28 29 1   4 ...
```

Here, we can see that 2026 is in the 3rd row from the center (including the center as a row). Since the spiral is symmetrical, we can deduce that 2026 must be in the same layer as the number 2025, which is one step before it. We know that 2025 is at the end of the 2nd row from the center, so 2026 is at the beginning of the 3rd row from the center.

Let's count the layers to find the layer that contains 2026. We know that each layer contains a square number of cells, with each side of the layer being one number longer than the side of the previous layer. The first layer contains 1^2 = 1 cell, the second layer contains 2^2 = 4 cells, the third layer contains 3^2 = 9 cells, and so on.

Let's calculate the number of cells in each layer up to the 3rd layer:

1st layer: 1^2 = 1 cell (contains 1)
2nd layer: 2^2 = 4 cells (contains 2 to 5)
3rd layer: 3^2 = 9 cells (contains 6 to 14)

Now we'll calculate the number of cells in each subsequent layer until we reach 2026:

4th layer: 4^2 = 16 cells (contains 15 to 30)
5th layer: 5^2 = 25 cells (contains 31 to 55)
6th layer: 6^2 = 36 cells (contains 56 to 90)
7th layer: 7^2 = 49 cells (contains 91 to 135)
8th layer: 8^2 = 64 cells (contains 136 to 199)
9th layer: 9^2 = 81 cells (contains 200 to 280)

We can see that 2026 is within the 9th layer. Since the 9th layer contains numbers from 200 to 280, we can determine that 2026 is exactly 26 numbers away from the beginning of the 9th layer.

Now, let's find the exact position of 2026. The 9th layer has 9 rows and columns. The first 8 layers have a total of 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 8^2 = 204 cells. Therefore, 2026 is the (204 + 26)th cell in the spiral.

The 9th layer starts with 200, so we can visualize a portion of the 9th layer like this:

```
... (200) (201) (202) (203) ...
... (204) (205) (206) (207) ...
... (208) (209) (210) (211) ...
...        .                .
...        .                .
... (224) (225) (226) (227) ...
... (228) (229) (230) (231) ...
... (232) (233) (234) (235) ...
... (236) (237) (238) (239) ...
```

Since we're looking for the 230th cell (204 + 26), we can count down 3 rows from the top and then 4 cells to the right to find 2026.

Now we need to identify the 8 neighbors of 2026. These neighbors will be directly adjacent to it in the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and the 4 diagonal directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).

Given the position of 2026 on the 9th layer, its neighbors are:

- Up: 2026 - 9 = 2017
- Down: 2026 + 9 = 2035
- Left: 2026 - 1 = 2025
- Right: 2026 + 1 = 2027
- Up-left: 2017 - 1 = 2016
- Up-right: 2017 + 1 = 2018
- Down-left: 2035 - 1 = 2034
- Down-right: 2035 + 1 = 2036

Now let's sum the neighbors:

2016 + 2017 + 2018 + 2025 + 2027 + 2034 + 2035 + 2036

First, we'll sum the pairs that are vertically aligned with 2026:

(2017 + 2035) + (2025 + 2027) = 4052 + 4052 = 8104

Now, we'll sum the pairs that are diagonally aligned with 2026:

(2016 + 2036) + (2018 + 2034) = 4052 + 4052 = 8104

Finally, we'll add these sums to get the total:

8104 + 8104 = 16208

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is \(\boxed{16208}\).

The answer is: 16208.
