To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its adjacent numbers.

The spiral of natural numbers on a square grid can be divided into layers, with each layer having a width of 2, 4, 6, etc. The first layer is just the number 1, the second layer contains numbers 2 through 8, the third layer contains numbers 9 through 24, and so on.

To find the layer in which 2026 is located, we can calculate the square root of 2026 and then determine how many complete layers of the spiral fit into that square root. Since the square root of 2026 is approximately 45, we can see that the layers up to 44^2 (which is 1936) are complete. This means 2026 is in the 45th layer.

The 45th layer starts at 1937 and ends at 2025 (since 45^2 = 2025). The numbers in this layer will go from 1937 to 2025 in a spiral pattern. To find the position of 2026 within this layer, we subtract 1937 from 2026, giving us 89. This means 2026 is the 89th number in the 45th layer.

The 45th layer has 45 * 2 sides, so it has 180 numbers. Since the spiral turns at the corners, we need to determine at which point in the spiral we are. There are 4 turns in each layer, so we divide 89 by 4 to find out how many full turns we have completed in this layer, which gives us 22 full turns with a remainder. This means 2026 is located after the 22nd turn in the 45th layer.

The 22nd turn will be at number 22 * 45 = 990. Subtracting this from 1937 (the start of the 45th layer) gives us 947, which is where the 22nd turn starts. The remainder when 89 is divided by 4 is 1, which means 2026 is on the first side after the 22nd turn.

Since we are on the first side after a turn, 2026 will be on the top side of the spiral. The neighbors of 2026 will then be:

- Directly above: 2026 - 45
- Diagonally above and to the left: 2026 - 46
- To the left: 2026 - 47
- Diagonally below and to the left: 2026 - 48
- Directly below: 2026 - 45 - 1 (since we are at the start of a new side after a turn)
- Diagonally below and to the right: 2026 - 46 - 1
- To the right: 2026 - 47 - 1
- Diagonally above and to the right: 2026 - 48 - 1

Now we can calculate the actual numbers:

- Directly above: 2026 - 45 = 1981
- Diagonally above and to the left: 2026 - 46 = 1980
- To the left: 2026 - 47 = 1979
- Diagonally below and to the left: 2026 - 48 = 1978
- Directly below: 2026 - 45 - 1 = 1975
- Diagonally below and to the right: 2026 - 46 - 1 = 1974
- To the right: 2026 - 47 - 1 = 1973
- Diagonally above and to the right: 2026 - 48 - 1 = 1972

Now we sum these neighbors:

1981 + 1980 + 1979 + 1978 + 1975 + 1974 + 1973 + 1972 = 15832

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is \boxed{15832}.

The answer is: 15832.
