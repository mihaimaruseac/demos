To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its immediate neighbors.

The spiral of natural numbers is laid out in a specific pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves in a clockwise direction, with each new layer containing an additional ring of numbers around the previous layer.

To visualize the spiral, let's denote the layers as follows:
1. The first layer is just the number 1.
2. The second layer contains the numbers 2 to 4.
3. The third layer contains the numbers 5 to 8.
4. The fourth layer contains the numbers 9 to 12.
And so on.

Each layer has 4 corners, and the numbers at the corners increase by 8 for each subsequent layer. We can find the layer that contains 2026 by finding the largest square number less than or equal to 2026. This is because the corners of each layer are perfect squares.

The largest square less than or equal to 2026 is 44^2 = 1936. This means that 2026 is in the 45th layer of the spiral. The 45th layer will contain the numbers from (45^2 - 44) to 45^2, which are 2025 to 2026. Therefore, 2026 is the last number in its layer.

The 45th layer has 4 sides of length 45, so the total number of elements along one side is 45 * 4 = 180. Since the spiral is symmetric, we can just consider one quadrant and then multiply the sum of that quadrant's neighbors by 4 to get the total sum.

In one quadrant, the neighbors of 2026 are:
- The corner of the previous layer (44^2 = 1936)
- The number just before 2026 on the same side (2026 - 1 = 2025)
- The number at the end of the previous side (180 * (45 - 1) + 45 = 180 * 44 + 45)

Let's calculate these numbers:
- The corner of the previous layer: 1936
- The number just before 2026: 2025
- The number at the end of the previous side: 180 * 44 + 45 = 7920 + 45 = 7965

Now, we will find the sum of these neighbors for one quadrant and then multiply by 4:
Sum for one quadrant = 1936 + 2025 + 7965 = 3731
Total sum for all 8 neighbors = 4 * Sum for one quadrant = 4 * 3731 = 14924

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 14924.
