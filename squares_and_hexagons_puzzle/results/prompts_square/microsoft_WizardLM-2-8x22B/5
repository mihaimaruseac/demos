To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a square grid spiral, we need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its neighbors.

The spiral of natural numbers is laid out as follows:

```
21 20 19 18 17 16
22 15 14 13 12 11
23 10   9   8 11 10
24  7   6   5   4
25  8   1   2  27
30 29 32 31 .
```

Here, we can see that the number 1 is at the center, and the numbers increase in a counter-clockwise spiral. We can notice a pattern in the spiral where each loop around the spiral contains a square number of elements. The first loop has 1^2 = 1 element, the second loop has 2^2 = 4 new elements, the third loop has 3^2 = 9 new elements, and so on.

To find the loop in which 2026 falls, we need to find the largest square number that is less than or equal to 2026. This is because the loops are based on square numbers, and each new loop starts with a square number.

The largest square number less than 2026 is 44^2 = 1936. This means that 2026 is in the loop that starts after 1936. The next square number is 45^2 = 2025. Since 2026 is one more than 2025, it is the first number in the new loop (the 45th loop).

Now, we need to determine the position of 2026 within its loop. Since it's the first number in the loop, it is on the bottom row of the loop. The bottom row of each loop has 4 sides (top, right, bottom, left), and the numbers on each side increase by 1 starting from the corner.

For the 45th loop, the bottom row starts with 2025 (the corner), and the numbers increase by 1 as we move to the right. The bottom row ends with 2025 + 44 = 2069. Since 2026 is the first number in this row, its neighbors are the last number of the previous (44th) loop and the next 7 numbers in the current loop.

The last number of the 44th loop is 2025 (the corner of the 45th loop). The next 7 numbers in the current loop are 2027 to 2033.

Now we can sum these neighbors:

2025 (last number of the 44th loop) + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033 (first 7 numbers of the 45th loop)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 + 2033

To calculate this sum, we can simply add 1 to 2025 and multiply by 8 (since there are 8 numbers in total):

Sum = (2025 + 1) * 8
Sum = 2026 * 8
Sum = 16184

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16184.
