 The spiral is the “Ulam’’ – or “square’’ – spiral that starts with 1 at the centre and then runs  

\[
\text{right,\;up,\;left,\;left,\;down,\;down,\;right,\;right,\;right,\;up,\;up,\;up,\;\dots }
\]

so that the side‑length of the squares increases by 2 each time.

### 1.  Locate 2026  

For a square of side \(2n+1\) the largest number is \((2n+1)^2\).
Since  

\[
45^{2}=2025<2026<47^{2}=2209,
\]

the number 2026 lies on the outer ring of the square of side \(47\) (the “\(n=23\)’’ ring).  
The first number of this ring is  

\[
(2n-1)^{2}+1=45^{2}+1=2026,
\]

and it sits at the coordinate  

\[
(23,-22)
\]

(i.e. one step to the right of the bottom‑right corner of the previous square).

### 2.  The eight neighbours  

The eight neighbours of a point \((x,y)\) are the eight cells \((x+dx,y+dy)\) with
\(dx,dy\in\{-1,0,1\}\) (excluding \((0,0)\)).
For \((23,-22)\) they are  

| direction | coordinate | number |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| West      | \((22,-22)\) | \(2025\)  (bottom‑right of the inner square) |
| North‑West| \((22,-21)\) | \(1850\)  (first cell of the inner ring) |
| North     | \((23,-21)\) | \(2027\)  (= 2026 + 1) |
| North‑East| \((24,-21)\) | \(2212\)  (third cell of the next ring) |
| East      | \((24,-22)\) | \(2211\)  (second cell of the next ring) |
| South‑East| \((24,-23)\) | \(2210\)  (first cell of the next ring) |
| South     | \((23,-23)\) | \(2209\)  (= \(47^{2}\)) |
| South‑West| \((22,-23)\) | \(2208\)  (cell just left of the bottom‑right corner of the outer ring) |

All these numbers are obtained from the formulas for the three consecutive rings
(\(n=22,23,24\)).

### 3.  Sum of the neighbours  

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{sum}&=2025+1850+2027+2212+2211+2210+2209+2208  \\
           &=16952 .
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence the required sum of the eight cells surrounding the number 2026 is  

\[
\boxed{16952}.
\]
