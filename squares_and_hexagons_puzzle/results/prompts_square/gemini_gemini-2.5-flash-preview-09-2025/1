Here is a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the Ulam spiral.

## 1. Understanding the Spiral and Coordinates

The spiral starts at 1 and moves outwards in layers. We can associate each number $N$ with a coordinate $(x, y)$, where $(0, 0)$ is the position of 1.

The layers (or rings) of the spiral are defined by the size of the square they form. The maximum value in the $k$-th layer is $(2k+1)^2$.

Let $N = 2026$. We need to determine which layer this number belongs to and find its coordinates.

## 2. Locating the Number $N=2026$

We look for the perfect squares surrounding 2026, focusing on odd squares:

* $43^2 = 1849$
* $45^2 = 2025$
* $47^2 = 2209$

Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2025 is the corner of an odd-sided square.

**Key Corner Information:**
Let $S_k = (2k+1)^2$.
* $k=22$: $S_{22} = (2\cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.

The number 2025 is the **bottom-right corner** of the $k=22$ layer.

## 3. Determining the Coordinates of 2026

The size of the square containing 2025 is $45 \times 45$. The coordinates of the corners of this square are determined by the side length $L = 45$. The distance from the center $(0, 0)$ to the edge is $R = (L-1)/2 = 22$.

* **Position of 2025:** $(R, -R) = (22, -22)$.

The spiral moves counter-clockwise. Starting from the bottom-right corner (2025), the next number moves **Up** (increasing $y$).

* **Position of 2026:** One step up from 2025.
  $N=2026$ is at coordinates $(22, -21)$.

## 4. Identifying the Neighbors of 2026

We are looking for the 8 neighbors of $N=2026$ at position $(x_N, y_N) = (22, -21)$.

The coordinates of the 8 neighbors are:
$$
(22 \pm 1, -21 \pm 1) \text{ or } (22, -21 \pm 1) \text{ or } (22 \pm 1, -21)
$$

| Neighbor | Coordinates $(x, y)$ | Value $N'$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $N_1$ | $(22, -20)$ | |
| $N_2$ | $(22, -22)$ | |
| $N_3$ | $(21, -21)$ | |
| $N_4$ | $(23, -21)$ | |
| $N_5$ | $(21, -20)$ | |
| $N_6$ | $(21, -22)$ | |
| $N_7$ | $(23, -20)$ | |
| $N_8$ | $(23, -22)$ | |

We must now find the number corresponding to each coordinate.

## 5. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

We use the known corner value $C_{22} = 2025$ at $(22, -22)$ and the next layer corner $C_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$.

**A. Neighbors in the $k=22$ Layer (Radius $R=22$):**

The maximum number in this layer is 2025, located at $(22, -22)$. The numbers decrease as we move counter-clockwise from the top-left corner $(R, R)$ or increase as we move counter-clockwise from the bottom-right corner $(-R, -R)$.

1. **$N_2$ at $(22, -22)$:** This is the corner.
   $$N_2 = 2025$$
2. **$N_3$ at $(21, -21)$:** This is 1 unit "inward" from 2025.
   In the spiral, if $N$ is at $(x, y)$, then $N-1$ is at $(x, y+1)$ (since 2026 is above 2025). We need to reverse the process to find the number at $(21, -21)$.
   $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$. The number at $R-1$ often corresponds to $S_{k-1} + $ diagonal offset.
   $43^2 = 1849$. The diagonal running through $(x, -x)$ corresponds to the numbers $1, 9, 25, 49, \dots$ which are $(2k-1)^2$.
   $41^2 = 1681$. $43^2 = 1849$.
   The value at $(21, -21)$ is the number that precedes the bottom-right corner $C_{21} = 43^2 = 1849$ by $2R$.
   The numbers on the main anti-diagonal $(x, -x)$ are the odd squares, $(2k-1)^2$.
   $k=21$: $(2\cdot 21 - 1)^2 = 41^2 = 1681$.
   The number 1681 is at coordinates $(20, -20)$.
   The next number on this anti-diagonal is 2025 at $(22, -22)$.
   Let's check the position of $1849 = 43^2$. This is the bottom-right corner of the $k=21$ square, $(21, -21)$.
   $$N_3 = 1849$$
3. **$N_6$ at $(21, -22)$:** This is 1 unit left of 2025.
   Since 2025 is the corner, the numbers proceed UP from 2025. Moving left (decreasing $x$) means going back in the spiral count.
   The maximum number reached on the bottom edge is the bottom-left corner $B_{L}$:
   $B_L = C_{22} - (2R) = 2025 - 44 = 1981$. This is at $(-22, -22)$.
   The bottom row runs from $x=22$ (2025) down to $x=-22$ (1981).
   $N(x, -22) = 2025 - (22 - x)$.
   For $x=21$: $N_6 = 2025 - (22 - 21) = 2025 - 1 = 2024$.
   $$N_6 = 2024$$

**B. Neighbors in the $k=23$ Layer (Radius $R=23$):**

The maximum number in this layer is $C_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$, located at $(23, -23)$. The layer starts counting down from 2209.

4. **$N_4$ at $(23, -21)$:** This number is on the right edge ($x=23$).
   The right edge runs from the top-right corner $(23, 23)$ down to the bottom-right corner $(23, -23)$.
   Top-Right Corner $T_R$: $C_{23} - 4R = 2209 - 4(23) = 2209 - 92 = 2117$. This is at $(23, 23)$.
   The values decrease downwards (decreasing $y$):
   $N(23, y) = 2117 - (23 - y)$.
   For $y=-21$: $N_4 = 2117 - (23 - (-21)) = 2117 - 44 = 2073$.
   $$N_4 = 2073$$
5. **$N_7$ at $(23, -20)$:** On the right edge, $y=-20$.
   $N_7 = 2117 - (23 - (-20)) = 2117 - 43 = 2074$.
   $$N_7 = 2074$$
6. **$N_8$ at $(23, -22)$:** On the bottom edge, 1 unit left of $C_{23}$.
   This number is immediately preceding 2209 on the bottom edge.
   $N_8 = 2209 - (23 - 23) + 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.
   (Wait, this calculation is confusing. Let's use the definition of the layer.)
   $C_{23} = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. The bottom row goes left (decreasing $x$).
   The number at $(23, -22)$ is 1 unit up from the corner, which means it is $4R$ units before the corner in the spiral count.
   $C_{23} - 4R = 2117$.
   The right edge starts at $(23, 23)$ with $2117$ and ends at $(23, -23)$ with $2209$.
   We are looking for $N_8$ at $(23, -22)$.
   $N_8 = 2117 - (23 - (-22)) = 2117 - 45 = 2072$.
   $$N_8 = 2072$$

**C. Remaining Neighbors (Above 2026):**

The central number is $N=2026$ at $(22, -21)$. The numbers increase as we move upwards in the spiral.

7. **$N_1$ at $(22, -20)$:** 1 unit up from 2026.
   $$N_1 = 2027$$
8. **$N_5$ at $(21, -20)$:**
   $N_5$ is adjacent to $N_1=2027$ and $N_3=1849$ and $N_6=2024$.
   $N_5$ is on the $R-1$ boundary, in the right segment of the square.
   We know $N_3 = 1849$ is at $(21, -21)$. This is the corner $C_{21}$.
   The numbers spiral outwards from 1849.
   1850 is at $(21, -20)$.
   $$N_5 = 1850$$

Let's summarize the list of neighbors:

| Value $N'$ | Coordinates $(x, y)$ | Distance from 2026 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $N_1 = 2027$ | $(22, -20)$ | Up |
| $N_2 = 2025$ | $(22, -22)$ | Down |
| $N_3 = 1849$ | $(21, -21)$ | Left |
| $N_4 = 2073$ | $(23, -21)$ | Right |
| $N_5 = 1850$ | $(21, -20)$ | Up-Left |
| $N_6 = 2024$ | $(21, -22)$ | Down-Left |
| $N_7 = 2074$ | $(23, -20)$ | Up-Right |
| $N_8 = 2072$ | $(23, -22)$ | Down-Right |

## 6. Calculation of the Sum

We sum the 8 neighboring values:

$$
S = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6 + N_7 + N_8
$$
$$
S = 2027 + 2025 + 1849 + 2073 + 1850 + 2024 + 2074 + 2072
$$

Group by approximate value:

1. **Near 2026 (Central Group):**
   $2027 + 2025 + 2024 = 6076$
2. **Right Side Group (Near 2073):**
   $2073 + 2074 + 2072 = 6219$
3. **Left Side Group (Near 1850):**
   $1849 + 1850 = 3699$

Total Sum:
$$
S = 6076 + 6219 + 3699
$$
$$
S = 12295 + 3699
$$
$$
S = 15994
$$

---
*(Self-Check using the average property: The sum of 8 neighbors of $N$ in a square grid is usually close to $8N$. $8 \times 2026 = 16208$. Since 2026 is close to a major corner (2025), two neighbors (1849 and 1850) are much smaller, pulling the average down significantly. $16208 - 15994 = 214$. The difference is about $1800 \times 2 - 2000 \times 2 = 400$ roughly, which is consistent with the pull of the inner layer.)*

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 15994.
