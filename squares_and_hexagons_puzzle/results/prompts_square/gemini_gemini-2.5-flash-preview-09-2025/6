This problem requires finding the location of the number $N=2026$ in the spiral grid and then calculating the sum of the numbers located at its eight neighboring positions.

1. Determine the layer $k$ for $N=2026$.
The highest number in layer $k$ is $S_k = (2k+1)^2$.
We find $k$ such that $S_{k-1} < 2026 \le S_k$.
Since $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$, we check $2k+1 = 45$.
$S_{22} = (2\cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
$S_{23} = (2\cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$.
$N=2025$ is the maximum number in Layer $k=22$. It is located at the lower right corner, $(k, -k) = (22, -22)$.

$N=2026$ starts Layer $k=23$. The spiral path dictates the starting position of a new layer $k$ is at $(k, -(k-1))$.
$P = 2026$ is located at $(x_P, y_P) = (23, -22)$.

2. Determine the values of the 8 neighbors $Q_i$ of $P(23, -22)$.
The neighbors $Q_i$ are located at $(x, y)$ where $x \in \{22, 23, 24\}$ and $y \in \{-23, -22, -21\}$, excluding $P$ itself.

We use the properties of the spiral layers (where $L_k$ denotes Layer $k$, and $S_k$ is the maximum value in $L_k$):

A. Neighbors in Layer 22 ($k=22$). $S_{22} = 2025$.
$Q_2 = (22, -22)$. This is $S_{22}$. $N(Q_2) = 2025$.

$Q_1 = (22, -21)$. This point is 1 unit above $Q_2$. Since $Q_2$ is $C_{22, R}$, the numbers decrease as we move up along $x=22$ in Layer 22 if we trace the path backwards from $S_{22}$.
However, Layer 22 starts at $S_{21}+1$ at $(22, -21)$.
$S_{21} = 41^2 = 1681$.
$N(Q_1) = N(22, -21) = 1681 + 1 = 1682$. (This is the start of $L_{22}$).

B. Neighbors in Layer 23 ($k=23$). $S_{23} = 2209$. $P=2026$.
$P(23, -22)$ starts the path defined by $L_{23}$. The path moves Up from $P$.
$Q_4 = (23, -21)$. This is the next number in the spiral path. $N(Q_4) = 2026 + 1 = 2027$.

$Q_5 = (23, -23)$. This is $C_{23, R}$. $N(Q_5) = S_{23} = 2209$.

$Q_3 = (22, -23)$. This position is immediately to the left of $Q_5$. Since the segment ending at $Q_5$ runs rightwards (increasing $x$), $Q_3$ is the predecessor of $Q_5$ on the spiral path.
$N(Q_3) = S_{23} - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.

C. Neighbors in Layer 24 ($k=24$). $S_{23} = 2209$.
$L_{24}$ starts at $S_{23}+1 = 2210$. The starting position is $(k, -(k-1)) = (24, -23)$.
$Q_8 = (24, -23)$. $N(Q_8) = 2210$.

The path for $L_{24}$ starts with 1 step Right, then moves Up.
R segment (1 step): $2211$ at $(25, -23)$. (Not a neighbor).

Wait, the derived segments for layer $k$: R(1), U(2k-1), L(2k), D(2k), R(2k).
For $k=24$: $S_{23}=2209$.
1. R (1 step). $2210$ at $(24, -23)$. This is $Q_8$.
2. U (47 steps). Starts at $(24, -23)$.
$2211$ at $(24, -22)$. This is $Q_7$.
$2212$ at $(24, -21)$. This is $Q_6$.

3. Calculate the Sum $S$:
$N(Q_1) = 1682$
$N(Q_2) = 2025$
$N(Q_3) = 2208$
$N(Q_4) = 2027$
$N(Q_5) = 2209$
$N(Q_6) = 2212$
$N(Q_7) = 2211$
$N(Q_8) = 2210$

$$S = 1682 + 2025 + 2208 + 2027 + 2209 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210$$
$$S = (1682 + 2025) + (2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)$$
The sum of the five consecutive numbers centered around 2210 is $5 \times 2210 = 11050$.
$$S = 3707 + 2027 + 11050$$
$$S = 5734 + 11050 = 16784$$
