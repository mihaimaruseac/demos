Here is the step-by-step solution to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

### 1. Understand the Spiral Layout

The numbers are arranged in concentric square rings (shells). We need to determine where the number $N=2026$ falls.

The corners of the $k$-th square shell are typically perfect squares or squares plus/minus a small offset.

Let's focus on the corners of the squares $C_k$ that are on the positive $x$-axis (East direction, $y=0$):
* $k=1$: $1$ (Center)
* $k=2$: $9$ (Bottom right corner of the 3x3 square)
* $k=3$: $25$ (Bottom right corner of the 5x5 square)
* $k$: The number in the South-East (SE) corner of the $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ square is $(2k-1)^2$.

Let $S_k = (2k-1)^2$ be the number at the SE corner of the $k$-th shell.

### 2. Locate 2026

We need to find the square $S_k$ that is closest to 2026.

$$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$$

The nearest odd squares are:
* $43^2 = 1849$
* $45^2 = 2025$
* $47^2 = 2209$

Since $2025$ is a perfect square, it is an SE corner number.
$2025 = 45^2$.
This corresponds to the shell where $2k-1 = 45$, so $2k = 46$, or $k=23$.

The $23$-rd shell has side length 45, and the number $2025$ is located at the South-East (SE) corner.

### 3. Determine the Position of 2026

The numbers increase counter-clockwise.
The SE corner is $2025$.
The next number, $2026$, must be immediately North of 2025.

Let $(x, y)$ be the grid coordinates, with $(0, 0)$ being the center (where 1 is).
The $k=23$ shell extends from $x=-(22)$ to $x=22$ and $y=-(22)$ to $y=22$.
The side length is $2 \cdot 22 + 1 = 45$.
The maximum coordinate magnitude is $M = (45-1)/2 = 22$.

**Position of 2025 (SE Corner):**
$(x, y) = (22, -22)$.

**Position of 2026:**
Moving North from $(22, -22)$ brings us to $(22, -21)$.

So, $N=2026$ is at coordinates $(22, -21)$.
This means $2026$ is on the **East face** of the 23rd shell.

### 4. Find the Neighbors

We are looking for the sum of the 8 neighbors surrounding $N=2026$ at position $P = (22, -21)$.

The neighbors are the numbers at the surrounding coordinates $(x', y')$:
$x' \in \{21, 22, 23\}$
$y' \in \{-22, -21, -20\}$

We need to determine which numbers occupy these 8 positions.

#### A. Neighbors on the same shell ($k=23$) or smaller ($k < 23$)

The 23rd shell involves coordinates where $\max(|x|, |y|) = 22$.
The outer boundary of the $k=23$ shell is $|x|=22$ or $|y|=22$.

1. **Neighbor N1 (22, -20):**
   This is still on the East face, $|x|=22, |y|<22$. $N_1$ belongs to the $k=23$ shell.

2. **Neighbor N2 (21, -20):**
   $|x|<22, |y|<22$. This coordinate belongs to the internal $k=22$ shell (or smaller).
   Since $|x|$ and $|y|$ are 21 and 20, the containing shell is $k=22$, which has a max coordinate magnitude of $21$.

3. **Neighbor N3 (21, -21):**
   This is an inner corner position for the $k=23$ shell, belonging to the $k=22$ shell.

4. **Neighbor N4 (21, -22):**
   This is on the South face, $|x|<22, |y|=-22$. $N_4$ belongs to the $k=23$ shell.

5. **Neighbor N5 (22, -22):**
   This is the SE corner of the $k=23$ shell. We already know this number: $2025$.

#### B. Neighbors on the next shell ($k=24$)

The 24th shell has a maximum coordinate magnitude of $M' = 23$.

6. **Neighbor N6 (23, -22):** SE Face of the $k=24$ shell.
7. **Neighbor N7 (23, -21):** East Face of the $k=24$ shell.
8. **Neighbor N8 (23, -20):** East Face of the $k=24$ shell.

### 5. Calculate the Neighbor Values

Let $M=22$. The $k=23$ shell runs from $S_{22} + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$ up to $S_{23} = 2025$, and then wraps around. (Wait, $S_k$ is the corner of the $(2k-1)\times(2k-1)$ square, which is the $k$-th shell).

$S_{23} = 2025$ (SE corner, $22, -22$)
The shell starts at $S_{22} + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850$.
$2025$ is the SE corner.

The coordinates for $2026$ are $(M, -M+1) = (22, -21)$.

#### Finding Neighbors on Shell 23 ($M=22$):

**N5 (22, -22):** SE Corner.
$$N_5 = 2025$$

**N4 (21, -22):** South Face.
The South face runs from $(M-1, -M)$ up to $(-M, -M)$.
The length of the side is $2M$. $2025$ is the start of the side (moving counter-clockwise).
$N_4$ is immediately West of $N_5$. Since numbers increase counter-clockwise, the number West of 2025 must be smaller.
The numbers $N$ on the South side are in the range $1850 \leq N \leq 2025$.
The SW corner is $S_{23} - (2M) = 2025 - 44 = 1981$.
The numbers on the South side are counted clockwise from SW (1981) to SE (2025).
$P_{SE} = 2025$. $P_{SE-1} = 2024$.
$N_4$ is at $(21, -22)$, which is 1 step West of $(22, -22)$.
$$N_4 = 2024$$

**N1 (22, -20):** East Face.
$N_1$ is 1 step North of $N=2026$.
$N=2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
The NE corner is $S_{23} + (2M) = 2025 + 44 = 2069$.
$N_1$ is 2 steps North of 2025.
$$N_1 = 2027$$

#### Finding Neighbors on Shell 24 ($M'=23$):

$S_{24} = 47^2 = 2209$. This is at $(23, -23)$.
$M'=23$. The total side length is $2M' = 46$.

The sequence goes: $2209$ (SE) $\rightarrow 2210, 2211, \dots$ North along the East face.

**N6 (23, -22):**
This is 1 step North of the SE corner $(23, -23)$.
$$N_6 = 2209 + 1 = 2210$$

**N7 (23, -21):**
This is 2 steps North of the SE corner.
$$N_7 = 2209 + 2 = 2211$$

**N8 (23, -20):**
This is 3 steps North of the SE corner.
$$N_8 = 2209 + 3 = 2212$$

#### Finding Neighbors on Shell 22 ($M''=21$):

The $k=22$ shell has its SE corner at $S_{22} = 43^2 = 1849$. This position is $(21, -21)$.
$M''=21$.

**N3 (21, -21):** SE Corner of the inner shell.
$$N_3 = 1849$$

**N2 (21, -20):**
$N_3=1849$ is at the SE corner $(21, -21)$. The numbers increase counter-clockwise (North).
$N_2$ is immediately North of $N_3$.
$$N_2 = 1850$$

### 6. Calculate the Sum

We have found the 8 neighbors:
$$
\begin{matrix}
N_2 (1850) & N_1 (2027) & N_8 (2212) \\
N_3 (1849) & \mathbf{2026} & N_7 (2211) \\
N_4 (2024) & N_5 (2025) & N_6 (2210) \\
\end{matrix}
$$

Sum $S = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6 + N_7 + N_8$
$S = 2027 + 1850 + 1849 + 2024 + 2025 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$

Let's group them strategically:
1. Neighbors below 2026: $1850 + 1849 + 2024 + 2025$
2. Neighbors above 2026: $2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$

Group 1: $2024 + 2025 + 1849 + 1850 = 4049 + 3699 = 7748$
Group 2: $2027 + (2210 + 2211 + 2212)$
The average of the three large numbers is 2211. Sum $= 3 \times 2211 = 6633$.
Group 2: $2027 + 6633 = 8660$

Total Sum $S = 7748 + 8660$
$S = 16408$

### Alternative Method Check (Sum = $8 \times N + K$)

The sum of 8 neighbors of a number $N$ is often close to $8N$. Let $N=2026$. $8N = 16208$.

We can calculate the difference $K$:
$N_1 = N + 1$
$N_5 = N - 1$
$N_4 = N - 2$
$N_3 = 1849 = N - 177$
$N_2 = 1850 = N - 176$

$N_6 = 2210 = N + 184$
$N_7 = 2211 = N + 185$
$N_8 = 2212 = N + 186$

$K = (1) + (-1) + (-2) + (-177) + (-176) + (184) + (185) + (186)$

We calculate the sum of the offsets:
$K = (1 - 1) - 2 + (184 + 185 + 186) - (177 + 176)$
$K = -2 + (555) - (353)$
$K = 553 - 353$
$K = 200$

Total Sum $= 8N + K = 16208 + 200 = 16408$.

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16408.
