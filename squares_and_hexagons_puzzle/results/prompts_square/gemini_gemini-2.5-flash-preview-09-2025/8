The position of a number $N$ in this square spiral arrangement is determined by finding the layer $K$ to which it belongs. The largest number in layer $K$ is $M_K = (2K+1)^2$.

We find $K$ such that $M_{K-1} < 2026 \le M_K$.
We calculate the squares of odd integers:
$43^2 = 1849$. $M_{21} = 1849$.
$45^2 = 2025$. $M_{22} = 2025$.
$47^2 = 2209$. $M_{23} = 2209$.

Since $2025 < 2026 \le 2209$, the number $N=2026$ belongs to Layer $K=23$.

Let $K=23$. The center of the spiral is $(0, 0)$. Layer $K$ spans coordinates from $-K$ to $K$.
The number $M_{K-1}=2025$ is located at the South-East corner of the Layer $K-1=22$ square, which is $(K-1, -(K-1)) = (22, -22)$.

The numbers in Layer $K$ start immediately after $M_{K-1}$, moving one step East.
$N=2026$ is located at $(23, -22)$.

We need to find the values of the 8 neighbors of $P_N = (23, -22)$. Let $L(x, y)$ be the number at $(x, y)$.

1. $P_1 = (23, -21)$. The spiral continues North along the $x=23$ line (Segment 2 of Layer 23).
$L_1 = L(23, -21) = 2026 + 1 = 2027$.

2. $P_2 = (23, -23)$. This is the South-East corner of Layer 23, where the layer ends.
$L_2 = L(23, -23) = M_{23} = 2209$.

3. $P_3 = (22, -21)$. This point belongs to Layer 22. $M_{22}=2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The Layer 22 spiral started moving East from $M_{21}=1849$ at $(21, -21)$ to $S_{22}$ at $(22, -21)$, and then North.
$S_{22} = M_{21} + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.
$L_3 = L(22, -21) = 1850$.

4. $P_4 = (22, -22)$. This is $M_{22}$.
$L_4 = L(22, -22) = 2025$.

5. $P_5 = (22, -23)$. This point is on the closing segment (East segment) of Layer 23, which runs along $y=-23$ towards $M_{23}=2209$.
$L_5 = L(23-1, -23) = M_{23} - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.

6. $P_6 = (24, -21)$. This point belongs to the next layer, $K''=24$.
Layer 24 starts at $S_{24} = M_{23} + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210$.
$S_{24}$ is located at $(24, -23)$. (East 1 step from $M_{23}$).
The spiral then moves North:
$L(24, -23) = 2210$.
$L(24, -22) = 2211$.
$L(24, -21) = 2212$.
$L_6 = 2212$.

7. $P_7 = (24, -22)$.
$L_7 = 2211$.

8. $P_8 = (24, -23)$.
$L_8 = 2210$.

The sum $S$ of the 8 neighbors is:
$S = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + L_4 + L_5 + L_6 + L_7 + L_8$
$S = 2027 + 2209 + 1850 + 2025 + 2208 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210$

$S = (2027 + 2025) + 1850 + (2209 + 2208) + (2212 + 2211 + 2210)$
$S = 4052 + 1850 + 4417 + 6633$
$S = 5902 + 4417 + 6633$
$S = 10319 + 6633$
$S = 16952$.
