Here is a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the Ulam spiral layout.

## 1. Analyze the Spiral Layout and Identify Corner Numbers

The spiral starts at 1 and moves outwards. Key numbers are found on the corners of the expanding squares.

We define $C(k)$ as the number that is the top-right corner of the $k$-th layer square (where $k$ is the side length of the square minus 1, or $2n$ where $n$ is the layer number).

Let $L$ be the side length of the square being completed. The numbers on the corners are perfect squares of odd numbers.

| Layer (n) | Side Length (L = 2n+1) | Corner (TR) Value $C$ | Formula ($L^2$) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 3 | 9 | $3^2$ |
| 2 | 5 | 25 | $5^2$ |
| 3 | 7 | 49 | $7^2$ |
| k | 2k+1 | $(2k+1)^2$ | $(2k+1)^2$ |

The key observation is that numbers that are perfect squares of *odd* numbers are located at the bottom-right position of their respective squares, which corresponds to the location of the number 9 in the provided diagram.
Wait, let's re-examine the provided diagram and coordinate system.

\begin{matrix}
... & 5 & 4 & 3 & ... \\
... & 6 & 1 & 2 & ... \\
... & 7 & 8 & 9 & ... \\
\end{matrix}

The number 9 is the **Bottom-Right** corner of the $3 \times 3$ square.

The square numbers we care about are $L^2$: $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, etc. These define the end of each layer (moving counter-clockwise).

## 2. Locate 2026 in the Spiral

We need to find the perfect odd square closest to 2026.

$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$

The nearest odd square is $45^2$.
$45^2 = 2025$.

Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2025 is the corner number for the square of side length 45. This corner is the **Bottom-Right (BR)** position.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\hline
\dots & \text{Previous Layer} & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\hline
\dots & \dots & \mathbf{2025} & \mathbf{2026} & \dots \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
(This visualization might be tricky; let's rely on the structure relative to the center 1.)

**Position of 2025:**
The center of the square grid is (0, 0), occupied by 1.
The side length $L=45$. The coordinates of 2025 are $(n, -n)$, where $n = (L-1)/2 = 22$.
So, 2025 is located at $(22, -22)$.

**Position of 2026:**
The spiral moves counter-clockwise from 2025 (BR).
2026 must be directly to the left of 2025, starting the move up the left edge of the $45 \times 45$ square.
Wait, let's check the direction of movement near 9:
$9 \to 8 \to 7$ (Moving Left).
Since 2025 is a $45^2$ number, it is located at the $BR$ corner. The numbers decrease as we move left (e.g., $9 \to 8$).
Numbers increase as we move counter-clockwise.

The spiral movement:
1. $1 \to 2$ (Right)
2. $2 \to 3$ (Up)
3. $3 \to 4 \to 5$ (Left)
4. $5 \to 6$ (Down)
5. $6 \to 7 \to 8$ (Right)
6. $8 \to 9$ (Down) <-- ERROR IN PROVIDED DIAGRAM

Let's re-examine the provided diagram:
\begin{align*}
& \dots & 5 & 4 & 3 \\
& \dots & 6 & 1 & 2 \\
& \dots & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{align*}
Movement: $1 \to 2$ (R), $2 \to 3$ (U), $3 \to 4$ (L), $4 \to 5$ (L), $5 \to 6$ (D), $6 \to 7$ (D), $7 \to 8$ (R), $8 \to 9$ (R).

Ah, $9$ is the **Bottom-Right** (BR) corner. The numbers *increase* in this direction.

$2025 = 45^2$. This is the BR corner.
$2026$ must be the number that immediately follows 2025 in the spiral sequence.

The path sequence near 2025:
... (Previous number $P$) $\to 2025$ (BR) $\to 2026 \to 2027 \dots$

Based on the $8 \to 9$ movement (Right), the spiral moves Right along the bottom row, completing the square at the BR corner (9, 25, 49, ..., 2025).

If 2025 is at the BR corner, the next layer starts by moving **Up** from 2025.

If 2025 is at $(22, -22)$:
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$. (Moving Up)

**2026 is located on the Right Edge of the grid, one cell above the Bottom-Right corner.**

## 3. Identify the Neighbors of 2026

Since 2026 is at $(22, -21)$, we can identify its 8 neighbors relative to coordinates $(x, y)$:

| Neighbor | Coordinates (x, y) | Position relative to 2026 | Value (N) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| N1 | (22, -20) | Above (U) | $N_{U}$ |
| N2 | (23, -20) | Up-Right (UR) | $N_{UR}$ |
| N3 | (23, -21) | Right (R) | $N_{R}$ |
| N4 | (23, -22) | Down-Right (DR) | $N_{DR}$ |
| N5 | (22, -22) | Below (D) | $N_{D}$ |
| N6 | (21, -22) | Down-Left (DL) | $N_{DL}$ |
| N7 | (21, -21) | Left (L) | $N_{L}$ |
| N8 | (21, -20) | Up-Left (UL) | $N_{UL}$ |

We know $N_5 = 2025$ (The BR corner).
We need to determine the layer structure for the remaining neighbors.

The number 2026 is on the right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square (where the numbers range up to $45^2=2025$) or near the starting edge of the $47 \times 47$ square ($47^2=2209$).

Since 2026 is at $x=22$, it is on the boundary of the layer $n=22$.

### Neighbor Values Calculation

**A. Neighbors within the $45 \times 45$ boundary (x=21 or y=-22)**

We use $L=45$.
The center of the sides are defined by $L^2 - (L-1)/2$.
$2025 - 22 = 2003$.
2003 is the center of the right side (R). This means 2003 is at $(22, 0)$.

Wait, $45^2=2025$ is the BR corner $(22, -22)$.
The right edge consists of numbers moving from top (small number) to bottom (2025).

Let's find the values of the four corners (CCW starting from 2025):
$C_{BR} = 45^2 = 2025$ (At (22, -22))
$C_{BL} = 2025 - 44 = 1981$ (At (-22, -22))
$C_{TL} = 1981 - 44 = 1937$ (At (-22, 22))
$C_{TR} = 1937 - 44 = 1893$ (At (22, 22))

Now we trace the previous layer values ($L=43$, ending at $43^2=1849$).
$1849$ is at $(21, -21)$.

$L=45$. The coordinates of the grid are $-22 \le x, y \le 22$.

**$N_5$ (D): (22, -22)**
$N_5 = 2025$

**$N_6$ (DL): (21, -22)**
This is on the bottom edge, one step left of 2025.
Since the bottom edge moves Right ($7 \to 8 \to 9$), the numbers increase rightward.
$N_6$ is one cell left of 2025.
$N_6 = 2025 - 1 = 2024$.

**$N_7$ (L): (21, -21)**
This is the TR corner of the $43 \times 43$ square.
$N_7 = 43^2 = 1849$.
(This conclusion depends on the starting point of the spiral. Let's verify.)
$1849$ is located at $(21, 21)$ if we use the same corner definition.
$43^2 = 1849$. For $L=43$, $n=21$. The $L^2$ number is always at $(n, -n)$ = $(21, -21)$.
$N_7 = 1849$.

**$N_8$ (UL): (21, -20)**
This position is one cell above $N_7$ (1849) and is part of the move outward from the previous layer.
The move from $L^2$ to $(L+2)^2$ happens generally Up (from BR) then Left (from TR).
Since 1849 is at $(21, -21)$, and it is the BR corner of the $43 \times 43$ square, the number $1850$ is at $(21, -20)$.
$N_8 = 1850$.

**B. Neighbors outside the $45 \times 45$ boundary (x=23 or y=-20)**

The number 2026 is $(22, -21)$. It belongs to the current layer $n=22$.
The next square is $47 \times 47$. $47^2 = 2209$. This square defines coordinates $x, y \in [-23, 23]$.

**$N_1$ (U): (22, -20)**
2026 is $2025+1$. Since 2025 is BR, the spiral moves Upward.
$N_1$ is the number immediately following 2026.
$N_1 = 2027$.

**$N_2$ (UR): (23, -20)**
This is located on the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square. This side is currently being filled.
The full length of the right side is $L+1 = 46$ steps (from $y=-22$ to $y=23$).
The numbers $2026, 2027, \dots$ fill this side, moving up.
The right edge ends at the TR corner $C_{TR}$ (of the $47 \times 47$ square), which is $47^2 - (47-1)/2 - 46\times 2 - 46 = 2209 - 23 - 92 - 46 = 2048$.
Wait, calculating the corners of the $47 \times 47$ square:
$C_{BR} = 47^2 = 2209$. (At (23, -23))
$C_{BL} = 2209 - 46 = 2163$.
$C_{TL} = 2163 - 46 = 2117$.
$C_{TR} = 2117 - 46 = 2071$. (At (23, 23))

The path starts at 2025 (BR of $45^2$ square).
The path moves Up: $2026, 2027, \dots$ up the side $x=22$.
The side length $L_{side}$ of the new layer is $L=47$. The distance from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 23)$ is $45$ steps.
2025 is at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
$2027$ is at $(22, -20)$. ($N_1$)
...
The sequence continues until $y=22$. $2025 + (22 - (-22)) = 2025 + 44 = 2069$.
$2069$ is at $(22, 22)$.

$N_1 = 2027$.

$N_2$ (UR) = (23, -20). This location will be filled when the spiral reaches the edge $x=23$.
The number 2070 is at $(22, 23)$. (This is the top neighbor of 2069).
The spiral then moves Left.

The numbers $2026, 2027, \dots, 2070$ fill the column $x=22$. This is the Right side of the $45 \times 45$ square.

Now we need to consider the structure shown in the initial diagram around 1:
\begin{matrix}
5 & 4 & 3 \\
6 & 1 & 2 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{matrix}
The location (22, -21) corresponds to the location of 2.
Neighbors of 2: 1, 3, 9. (And 4, 8, L1, L2, L3)

Neighbors of 2:
1 (L), 3 (U), 9 (D).
Wait, 2 is at (1, 0).
L (0, 0) = 1
U (1, 1) = 3
D (1, -1) = 9

Let's adjust coordinates based on the $L^2$ position (BR):
9 is at (1, -1). 2025 is at (22, -22).
8 is at (0, -1). 2024 is at (21, -22). ($N_6$)
7 is at (-1, -1). 2023 is at (20, -22).
...

2 is at (1, 0). 2026 is at (22, -21).
Neighbors of 2026 (22, -21):

| Pos | Coords | Value | Name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| D | (22, -22) | 2025 | $N_5$ |
| DL | (21, -22) | 2024 | $N_6$ |
| L | (21, -21) | 1849 | $N_7$ |
| UL | (21, -20) | 1850 | $N_8$ |
| U | (22, -20) | 2027 | $N_1$ |

We still need $N_2, N_3, N_4$. These are outside the $x=22$ column, at $x=23$.
The numbers $2026, 2027, \dots, 2070$ fill the $x=22$ column.
After $2070$ (at $(22, 23)$), the spiral moves Left, filling $y=23$.
$2071$ is at $(21, 23)$.

$N_2$ (UR): (23, -20).
$N_3$ (R): (23, -21).
$N_4$ (DR): (23, -22).

These positions will be filled much later when the spiral reaches the boundary $x=23$.

The $47 \times 47$ square boundary starts at $2070+1 = 2071$ if we follow standard Ulam spirals (which move CCW around the origin).

Let's confirm the coordinates of the start of the next layer based on the $9 \to 10$ transition (if $L=3$ square is $9$, $L=5$ square starts at $10$).
$9$ is at $(1, -1)$.
$10$ is at $(2, -1)$. (Moving Right, $9 \to 10$)

Wait, my coordinates or direction of spiral flow are inconsistent with the standard Ulam spiral. Let's strictly follow the provided sequence:

\begin{matrix}
\dots & 5 & 4 & 3 \\
\dots & 6 & 1 & 2 \\
\dots & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{matrix}
$1 \to 2$ (R), $2 \to 3$ (U), $3 \to 4$ (L), $4 \to 5$ (L), $5 \to 6$ (D), $6 \to 7$ (D), $7 \to 8$ (R), $8 \to 9$ (R).

The spiral moves CCW, except for the last step $8 \to 9$ which moves R. This completes a square of odd side length $L$.
The next number, 10, starts the next layer.
$9$ is at BR. $10$ must start the next layer, either up or left/down.
If 10 follows the CCW movement, $9 \to 10$ should be Down, completing the structure. But the layout suggests 9 is the terminus.

Let's assume the spiral continues CCW:
$9 \to 10$ must be down (if 9 is BR) or left (if 9 is TL). Since 9 is BR, the square is complete.
The next number must be $L+2$ away from the center (L=5 side length).
If we follow $5 \to 6 \to 7$, the square expands downwards and rightwards.

If 9 is $(1, -1)$. 10 must be the start of the next layer.
If we examine standard Ulam spirals, the numbers $L^2$ are often found on the diagonal $(n, -n)$ or $(-n, n)$. Here, $9$ is at $(1, -1)$.

If 10 is at $(2, -1)$ (Continuing Right), this means the bottom row continues right, and then the $5 \times 5$ square starts building around that.

If $9 \to 10$ is R:
$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$
$6, \dots$
$7, 8, 9, 10$

If 10 is at $(2, -1)$:
$10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25$.
$25$ is $5^2$.
If $9$ is at $(1, -1)$, $25$ is at $(2, -2)$. This confirms $L^2$ numbers are at $(-n, -n)$ or $(n, n)$ for even $L$.
Since $L=5$ is odd, $n=2$. $25$ is at $(2, -2)$.

Wait, $9$ is $L=3$, $n=1$. Coordinates $(1, -1)$.
$25$ is $L=5$, $n=2$. Coordinates $(2, -2)$.

The BR corner of layer $n$ is at $(n, -n)$.
2025 is $45^2$. $n=22$. 2025 is at $(22, -22)$.

The sequence is: $L^2, L^2+1, L^2+2, \dots$ along the bottom edge, moving Right.
$9 \to 10 \to 11 \to \dots \to 25$.

$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. (Moving Right from 2025)

This means 2026 is starting the next layer ($L=47$). It is located on the **Bottom Edge**.

## 4. Re-evaluate Position of 2026

If $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, it is one step right of the corner 2025.

**The location of 2026 is $N_4$ (DR) in the previous calculation.**
$N_4 = 2026$.

We must find the 8 neighbors of $X=2026$ located at $(23, -22)$.

| Neighbor | Coordinates (x, y) | Position relative to X | Value (N) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| N1 | (23, -21) | Above (U) | $N_{U}$ |
| N2 | (24, -21) | Up-Right (UR) | $N_{UR}$ |
| N3 | (24, -22) | Right (R) | $N_{R}$ |
| N4 | (24, -23) | Down-Right (DR) | $N_{DR}$ |
| N5 | (23, -23) | Below (D) | $N_{D}$ |
| N6 | (22, -23) | Down-Left (DL) | $N_{DL}$ |
| N7 | (22, -22) | Left (L) | $N_{L}$ |
| N8 | (22, -21) | Up-Left (UL) | $N_{UL}$ |

$L=45$. $n=22$. $45^2 = 2025$.
$L=47$. $n=23$. $47^2 = 2209$.

**A. Neighbors in the $45 \times 45$ square (x=22, y=-22):**

$N_7$ (L): (22, -22). This is the corner $45^2$.
$N_7 = 2025$.

$N_8$ (UL): (22, -21). This position is on the Right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square.
$C_{BR} = 2025$ (at (22, -22)).
Since the spiral fills the right edge from TR (1893) downwards to BR (2025), the numbers decrease moving Up.
$2025$ is $45^2$. The side length is 44 steps.
$2025 - 1 = 2024$ must be at $(22, -21)$.
$N_8 = 2024$.

**B. Neighbors in the expanding layer (x=23 or y=-23):**

2026 is on the bottom row, moving R.
$2026 \to 2027 \to \dots \to 2209$.

$N_3$ (R): (24, -22). $2026$ is at $x=23$. $N_3$ is two steps right of 2025.
$N_3 = 2027$.

$N_4$ (DR): (24, -23).
$N_5$ (D): (23, -23).
$N_6$ (DL): (22, -23).

These three positions belong to the $47 \times 47$ square edge ($n=23$).
The maximum $x, y$ coordinates are 23.
Since $N_4, N_5, N_6$ have $y=-23$, they must be on the bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The bottom edge ranges from $x=-23$ to $x=23$.
The BR corner $47^2 = 2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.

$N_5$: (23, -23). This is $2209$.
$N_4$: (24, -23). This is outside the $47 \times 47$ square range.

Wait, if $N_7 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$, and $X=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, then the layer $n=22$ spans $x \in [-22, 22]$, $y \in [-22, 22]$.
The $L=47$ layer spans $x \in [-23, 23]$, $y \in [-23, 23]$.

If 2026 is at $(23, -22)$, it is on the outer boundary $x=23$.
The bottom row of this layer is $y=-23$.

If 2026 is at $x=23$, it must be part of the sequence filling the $x=23$ column, moving downwards, or $y=-22$ row, moving rightwards.

Let's re-examine the movement $9 \to 10$.
9 is at $(1, -1)$. The bottom row goes $7, 8, 9$.
10 is at $(2, -1)$. The spiral continues to the right. $10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24$.
$25$ is at $(2, -2)$. This confirms the spiral moves Right until it reaches the edge, then turns Down.

$45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$. This is the BR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square is $y=-23$.
The right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square is $x=23$.

$2026$ starts the expansion of the $47 \times 47$ square.
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
If the spiral moves R, $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
If the spiral moves D, $2026$ is at $(22, -23)$.

If $9 \to 10$ is Right:
$9(1,-1) \to 10(2,-1)$.
The sequence $L^2, L^2+1, \dots$ moves Right along the row $y=-1$.
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The numbers filling the new layer $n=23$ are $2026, 2027, \dots, 2209$.
$2026$ is located at $(23, -22)$. (Moving Right).

This means 2026 is on the **Right Edge** of the $L=47$ structure, $y=-22$ row.

Let $X=2026$. $X$ is at $(23, -22)$.

$N_7 (L): (22, -22) = 2025$. (Correct)
$N_8 (UL): (22, -21)$. This is part of the inner square's right edge.
As calculated earlier: the right edge of $L=45$ decreases upwards: $2025, 2024, 2023, \dots, 1893$.
$N_8 = 2024$. (Correct)

$N_6 (DL): (22, -23)$. This is on the bottom edge of the $L=47$ square.
The bottom edge is filled by moving Down (from 2209, the BR corner) or Left (from BL corner).
Since $47^2=2209$ is at $(23, -23)$, this is $N_5$.
$N_6$ is one step left of $N_5$.
Since the bottom edge moves $L^2 \to L^2+1 \to \dots$ Right, the numbers increase rightward.
$C_{BL} = 2209 - 46 = 2163$. (At $(-23, -23)$).
If we follow $7, 8, 9, 10, \dots$, the bottom row increases moving Right.
The path must fill the $y=-23$ row from $x=-23$ (2163) to $x=23$ (2209).
$N_6 = (22, -23)$. This is $2209 - 1 = 2208$.

$N_5 (D): (23, -23)$. This is $47^2$.
$N_5 = 2209$.

$N_4 (DR): (24, -23)$. This is outside the $L=47$ grid boundary. This position is filled later, in the $L=49$ layer.
$49^2 = 2401$. $n=24$. $2401$ is at $(24, -24)$.
The sequence starts $2209 + 1 = 2210$.
$2210$ is at $(23, -24)$.
The square $L=47$ completes at $2209$. The next layer $L=49$ starts at $2210$.
Since 2026 is at $(23, -22)$, and 2210 is at $(23, -24)$, these are too far apart for $N_4$ to be filled by $2210$.

Let's look at the movement sequence defining the coordinates:
$L^2$ (BR) is at $(n, -n)$.
The next sequence fills $x=n+1$ from $y=-n$ to $y=-n-1$.
Example: $9$ at $(1, -1)$. $10$ at $(2, -1)$. $11$ at $(3, -1)$? No.
$9 \to 10 \to \dots \to 25$. $25$ is at $(2, -2)$.
$9(1, -1)$. $10(2, -1)$. $11(2, 0)$. $12(2, 1)$. $13(2, 2)$. $14(1, 2)$. $15(0, 2)$. $16(-1, 2)$. $17(-2, 2)$. $18(-2, 1)$. $19(-2, 0)$. $20(-2, -1)$. $21(-2, -2)$. $22(-1, -2)$. $23(0, -2)$. $24(1, -2)$. $25(2, -2)$.

Wait, this spiral definition is different from the provided example $1..9$.
The provided diagram: $7, 8, 9$ are on $y=-1$. 9 is $(1, -1)$. 8 is $(0, -1)$. 7 is $(-1, -1)$.
The full $3 \times 3$ square goes from $x, y \in [-1, 1]$.
$9 \to 10$ must be outside this square.

If 10 is at $(2, -1)$, then $10, 11, 12, \dots$ fills the $5 \times 5$ square boundary.
$9(1, -1) \to 10(2, -1)$. R
$10 \to 11(2, 0)$. U
$11 \to 12(2, 1)$. U
$12 \to 13(2, 2)$. TR corner. U
$13 \to 14(1, 2)$. L
...
$25(2, -2)$. BR corner.

**This confirms the coordinates and movement flow for odd squares.**
$45^2 = 2025$ at $(22, -22)$. $n=22$.
$47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. $n=23$.

$X=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. It is the first number in the $L=47$ layer sequence.
The sequence moves $2026 \to 2027 \to \dots$ (Right) along $y=-22$, until $x=23$.

$X=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
$N_7$ (L): (22, -22). $N_7 = 2025$. (Correct, $45^2$)

**Remaining calculation for $x=23$ or $y=-23$ positions:**

$N_1$ (U): (23, -21). Since $2026$ is the first number in the $L=47$ layer, it moves Right along $y=-22$.
$N_1$ is located in the middle of this path, later.

$2026$ (at $(23, -22)$) $\to 2027$ (at $(24, -22)$). $N_3$.
$N_3$: (24, -22). $2026+1 = 2027$.

$N_2$ (UR): (24, -21). Filled by $2027+1 = 2028$.

$N_4$ (DR): (24, -23). Filled later.
$N_5$ (D): (23, -23). Filled later.
$N_6$ (DL): (22, -23). Filled later.

We need to know the structure of numbers around $X$.

Let $P$ be the number of steps along the current layer edge. $L=47$.
$P=0$ at 2026.
Edge 1 (Right): $y=-22$. $x=23 \to 45$. Wait, $x$ goes up to $n=23$. $x=23$.

$X=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
The next corner is $C_{TR}$ (of the $45 \times 45$ square) $1893$ at $(22, 22)$.

Let's check the coordinates for small numbers again:
$9(1, -1)$. $10(2, -1)$. $11(2, 0)$. $12(2, 1)$. $13(2, 2)$.
$13$ is $3^2+4$. $L=5$. $13$ is the TR center.

$25$ at $(2, -2)$. $L=5$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$. $L=45$.

$2026$ starts the $L=47$ layer. $n=23$.
The new layer boundary is $x=23$ and $y=-23$.

The $45 \times 45$ square ends at $x=22, y=22$.
The $47 \times 47$ square starts filling the gap $x=23, y=23$.

Where is $2026$?
It starts the counter-clockwise turn. $2025$ is the BR corner $(22, -22)$.
The sequence must fill the bottom row $y=-22$ (going right) or the right column $x=22$ (going down).

If the spiral followed $8 \to 9$ (R) and $9 \to 10$ (R), then $2025 \to 2026$ is Right.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.

The sequence $2026, 2027, \dots$ goes Right until it hits the boundary $x=23$.
Wait, $X=2026$ is already at $x=23$. This cannot be Right movement unless $2025$ was at $x=21$.

Let's re-examine $45^2=2025$.
$L=45$. $n=22$. The boundary is $x=22$.
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.

If $9$ is at $(1, -1)$, $10$ is at $(2, -1)$.
The sequence starts $L^2+1$ at $(n+1, -n)$.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. Correct.

The path continues right along $y=-22$ until $x=23$ is reached. Wait, $2026$ IS $x=23$.
$2026$ is the first cell in the $x=23$ column.

$10$ is at $(2, -1)$. $9$ is at $(1, -1)$.
$25$ is at $(2, -2)$. $24$ is at $(1, -2)$.
$L=5$. $n=2$. $x \in [-2, 2]$.

If $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, it means the sequence $2026, 2027, \dots$ moves Right beyond $x=23$.
This means $L^2$ is not the true corner, but the end of the previous side.

The BR corner of $L=45$ is $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The total length of the $L=47$ perimeter is $4 \times 46 = 184$.
$2025 + 184 = 2209 = 47^2$.

The new layer starts by extending the bottom row (Right) until $x=23$ is reached, then turning Down.
No, that's not CCW. CCW should be Up, then Left, then Down, then Right.

Let's stick to the $1 \to 9$ movement pattern:
R, U, L, L, D, D, R, R.
This structure repeats:
$L^2-2$: (-1, -1). $L^2-1$: (0, -1). $L^2$: (1, -1). (Rightward movement on bottom edge)

$2023, 2024, 2025$ are on the bottom row $y=-22$, $x=20, 21, 22$.
$2025$ is the BR corner $(22, -22)$.

$2026$ must be the first step Up (R $\to$ U).
$X=2026$ is at $(22, -21)$. (This was the assumption in Step 2, $N_1$ position).

If $X=2026$ is at $(22, -21)$:
$N_5$ (D): (22, -22). $N_5 = 2025$.
$N_6$ (DL): (21, -22). $N_6 = 2024$.
$N_7$ (L): (21, -21). This is the corner of the $43^2$ square. $N_7 = 1849$.
$N_8$ (UL): (21, -20). $N_8 = 1850$.

Now for the outside numbers ($x=23$ or $y=-20$).
$2026$ starts the $L=47$ boundary path.

The path moves Up from $2025(22, -22)$.
$2026$ (22, -21).
$2027$ (22, -20). $N_1$.
$2028$ (22, -19).
This path continues UP until $y=23$.

The Right edge is defined by $x=22$ (for $L=45$ square) or $x=23$ (for $L=47$ square).

Since $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$, the numbers $1893, \dots, 2025$ already filled the right edge $x=22$.
The spiral must move outwards to $x=23$.

Let's re-examine $9 \to 10$.
If $9 (1, -1)$ is BR. The square boundary is $x \in [-1, 1], y \in [-1, 1]$.
$10$ must be $(2, -1)$ or $(1, -2)$ or $(2, -2)$.

If $10$ starts the $L=5$ layer, it must be the start of the spiral movement R, D, L, U (CW) or U, L, D, R (CCW).
Since the inner loop was CCW (R, U, L, D... Wait, it was R, U, L, D then R, R for $7, 8, 9$).

If $10$ is the start of the next layer, it should usually expand outward.
If $9 \to 10$ is R: $10(2, -1)$. Sequence fills $y=-1$ rightward.
If $9 \to 10$ is D: $10(1, -2)$. Sequence fills $x=1$ downward.

If we assume the established pattern $7, 8, 9$ (R) leads to $9, 10, 11, \dots$ continuing R along $y=-1$:
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$. (This is $N_4$ from the calculation in Step 4).

If $X=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, we must calculate $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, N_5, N_6$.

$2026$ is followed by $2027, 2028, \dots$. This sequence moves R along $y=-22$.
$2027$ is at $(24, -22)$. $N_3$.
$2028$ is at $(25, -22)$.

The side length $L=47$ ($n=23$) spans $x \in [-23, 23]$.
$2026$ is at $x=23$. It is the corner of the new square $L=47$.

Let's confirm the coordinates of 25: $25(2, -2)$. $24(1, -2)$. $23(0, -2)$. $\dots$
$9(1, -1) \to 10(2, -1)$. R. $11(3, -1)$? No, the square size is $5 \times 5$, $x \in [-2, 2]$.

If $9(1, -1)$ is BR corner of $3 \times 3$.
$10$ starts the $5 \times 5$ square. The spiral must fill $x=2$ and $y=-2$.

Path $10 \to 25$:
$10$ must be at $(2, -1)$. $11(2, 0)$. $12(2, 1)$. $13(2, 2)$. U
$14(1, 2)$. L
$15(0, 2)$. L
$16(-1, 2)$. L
$17(-2, 2)$. TL corner. L
$18(-2, 1)$. D
$19(-2, 0)$. D
$20(-2, -1)$. D
$21(-2, -2)$. BL corner. D
$22(-1, -2)$. R
$23(0, -2)$. R
$24(1, -2)$. R
$25(2, -2)$. BR corner. R

**This is a standard Ulam spiral movement pattern (CCW, but the orientation of the coordinates is shifted).**

$45^2 = 2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. $n=23$.

$2026$ is the first number in the $L=47$ loop. It starts the Up movement from $2025$.
$2026$ must be at $(22, -21)$. (As initially assumed).

**Recalculating Neighbors based on $X=2026$ at $(22, -21)$**

$X=2026$. Neighbors $N_1$ (U) to $N_8$ (UL).

Known internal values ($x=21$ or $y=-22$):
$N_5 (D) = 2025$.
$N_6 (DL) = 2024$.
$N_7 (L) = 1849$.
$N_8 (UL) = 1850$.

**A. Right column (x=23)**

These positions are outside the current structure and are filled later by numbers starting $49^2=2401$.
$N_3$ (R): $(23, -21)$.
$N_4$ (DR): $(23, -22)$. This position is $2025+1=2026$? No, 2026 is $X$.

Let $C_{47} = 47^2 = 2209$. $C_{47}$ is at $(23, -23)$.
$C_{49} = 49^2 = 2401$. $C_{49}$ is at $(24, -24)$.
The layer $L=49$ starts $2210$.

$2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.
The spiral moves Up from 2209: $2210(23, -22)$, $2211(23, -21)$, $2212(23, -20)$, etc.
$N_4$: $(23, -22)$. This is $2210$.
$N_3$: $(23, -21)$. This is $2211$.

**B. Up positions ($y=-20$ or $x=22$)**

$N_1$ (U): (22, -20).
Since $2025 \to 2026 \to 2027 \to \dots$ moves Up:
$N_1 = 2027$.

$N_2$ (UR): (23, -20).
This position is reached by the $49^2$ sequence moving Up.
$2210(23, -22)$, $2211(23, -21)$, $2212(23, -20)$.
$N_2 = 2212$.

## 5. Summary of Neighbor Values

$X = 2026$.
1. $N_1$ (U): 2027
2. $N_2$ (UR): 2212
3. $N_3$ (R): 2211
4. $N_4$ (DR): 2210
5. $N_5$ (D): 2025
6. $N_6$ (DL): 2024
7. $N_7$ (L): 1849
8. $N_8$ (UL): 1850

## 6. Calculate the Sum (S)

$$S = 2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2025 + 2024 + 1849 + 1850$$

Group terms:
$S = (2027 + 2025) + (2024) + (1849 + 1850) + (2212 + 2211 + 2210)$
$S = 4052 + 2024 + 3699 + 6633$

$4052 + 2024 = 6076$
$3699 + 6633 = 10332$
$S = 6076 + 10332 = 16408$

Alternatively, use $X=2026$.

$S = (X+1) + (X + 186) + (X + 185) + (X + 184) + (X-1) + (X-2) + (X-177) + (X-176)$

Where:
$X = 2026$.
$2212 = 2026 + 186$.
$2211 = 2026 + 185$.
$2210 = 2026 + 184$.
$2025 = 2026 - 1$.
$2024 = 2026 - 2$.
$1849 = 2026 - 177$.
$1850 = 2026 - 176$.

$S = 8X + (1 + 186 + 185 + 184 - 1 - 2 - 177 - 176)$
$S = 8X + (184 + 185 + 186 + 1) - (1 + 2 + 177 + 176)$
$S = 8X + (556) - (356)$
$S = 8X + 200$.

$S = 8 \times 2026 + 200$
$8 \times 2026 = 16208$
$S = 16208 + 200 = 16408$.

---
*(Self-Correction check: The difference terms 177 and 176 relate to $45^2 - 43^2 = 2025 - 1849 = 176$. $2026 - 1849 = 177$. $2026 - 1850 = 176$. This matches the calculated difference terms.)*

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16408.
