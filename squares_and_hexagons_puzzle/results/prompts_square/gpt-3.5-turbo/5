To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to look at the numbers surrounding it on the spiral.

The number 2026 is located in the center of a square grid formed by the spiral. Its neighbors are 2027, 1972, 1971, 2016, 2015, 2060, 2061, and 2062.

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is:

2027 + 1972 + 1971 + 2016 + 2015 + 2060 + 2061 + 2062 = 20284. 

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 20284.
