To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we need to look at the numbers surrounding 2026 on the spiral.

Starting at the center of the spiral, we first need to figure out which "layer" of the spiral 2026 is on. The numbers on each layer of the spiral increase by 8 times the layer number. The first layer has the numbers 1-9, the second layer has the numbers 10-25, the third layer has the numbers 26-49, and so on.

To find the layer of the number 2026, we can calculate the maximum number on each layer and see which layer contains 2026:
- 1st layer: 9 (1^2 = 1, 3^2 = 9)
- 2nd layer: 25 (5^2 = 25)
- 3rd layer: 49 (7^2 = 49)
- 4th layer: 81 (9^2 = 81)
- 5th layer: 121 (11^2 = 121)
- ...

Since 2026 is greater than 25 (the maximum number on the second layer) but less than 49 (the maximum number on the third layer), we know that 2026 is on the third layer.

Now, let's find the position of 2026 on the third layer. The third layer has numbers from 26 to 49. To find the position of 2026, we calculate:
2026 - 25 = 2001

Since the third layer has 49 - 25 = 24 numbers, we can see that 2026 is the 2001st number on the third layer. This means that 2026 is in the lower left corner of the layer.

Next, let's calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid:
- 2017 (right)
- 2018 (top right)
- 2019 (top)
- 2013 (top left)
- 2005 (left)
- 2004 (bottom left)
- 2003 (bottom)
- 2009 (bottom right)

To find the sum, we simply add up all these numbers:
2017 + 2018 + 2019 + 2013 + 2005 + 2004 + 2003 + 2009 = 16088

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16088.
