To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral, we first need to find the position of 2026 on the grid.

The spiral pattern is as follows:

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18 5 4 3 12 29
40 19 6 1 2 11 28
41 20 7 8 9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49

Since 2026 is located on the outer ring of the spiral, we can infer that it is on the 45th position on the spiral, and therefore on the 3rd row of the spiral grid, since each row contains 7 numbers.

Looking at the spiral pattern, we find that the number 2026 is located at the following coordinates:

... 1992 1991 1990 1989 1988 1987
... 1993 1744 1743 1742 1741 1740 1986
... 1994 1745 1500 1499 1498 1739 1985
... 1995 1746 1501 1264 1263 1497 1984
... 1996 1747 1502 1265 2026 1262 1983
... 1997 1748 1503 1266 1267 1496 1982
... 1998 1749 1504 1505 1506 1495 1981

To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026, we need to sum the values of the numbers surrounding 2026:

1987 + 1986 + 1985 + 1984 + 1983 + 1982 + 1981 + 1495 = 15863

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 15863.
