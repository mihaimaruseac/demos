Since the grid is laid out in a spiral, there are a few steps to calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026:
1. The first step is to find which layer of the spiral the number 2026 is on. To do this, we need to find the square of the integer closest to the square root of 2026. In this case, the square root of 2026 is approximately 44.99, which means the number is on the 45th layer.
2. Next, we need to calculate the bottom-right corner of the square on the 45th layer. The formula for this is (2*n + 1)^2, where n is the layer number. For the 45th layer, this calculation gives us (2*45 + 1)^2 = 4051.
3. With this information, we know that the numbers on the 45th layer range from 2026 to 4051. To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026, we need to find the values of those neighbors.
4. The 8 neighbors of the number 2026 are the numbers 2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 2035, 2043, 2042, and 2041. Adding these numbers together gives us 2026.

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 2026.
