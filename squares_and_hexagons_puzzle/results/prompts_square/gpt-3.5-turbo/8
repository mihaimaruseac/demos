To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we can first determine the position of 2026 on the spiral.

If we assume that the center of the spiral is at position (0,0) and the number 1 is located at position (0,0), we can calculate the positions of the other numbers using the following steps:

1. The position of the number n in the spiral can be calculated using the following formulas:
   - Horizontal position: (n-1) mod(2x+1) - x
   - Vertical position: x - (n-1) div (2x+1)

2. The center of each square concentric square of the spiral has a natural number that is a perfect square. By calculating the position and value of the next perfect square number after 2026, we can determine that 2026 falls between the squares 44^2 and 45^2.

This means that 2026 is located somewhere on the 44th concentric square.

Now, we need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 (in the same concentric square or the previous and consecutive squares) and sum their values. The neighbors of 2026 are:

44^2 - 44 = 1936
44^2 - 45 = 2025
44^2 - 46 = 2116
2026 - 1 = 2025
2026 + 1 = 2027
44^2 + 45 = 2209
44^2 + 46 = 2300
45^2 - 1 = 2024
45^2 + 1 = 2026

Summing these 8 neighbors:

1936 + 2025 + 2116 + 2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 2300 + 2024 = 16662

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16662.
