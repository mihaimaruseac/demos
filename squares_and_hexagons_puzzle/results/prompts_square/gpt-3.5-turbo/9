To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we must first find the position of 2026 on the grid.

Since the spiral starts with 1 at the center and increases while spiraling outwards, we can see that the numbers increase by 8, 16, 24, 32, and so on. This means that 2026 would be on the layer where the numbers range from 2017 to 4032.

At this layer, the numbers in the four corners are 2017, 2517, 3017, and 4032. From these, we can see that 2026 must be on the edge of the square to the right of 2017. Therefore, it is in the second position on the edge.

Now we can calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 on the grid:

Neighbors:
1. 2017
2. 2017
3. 2018
4. 2525
5. 3272
6. 3287
7. 3286
8. 3285

Sum = 2017 + 2017 + 2018 + 2525 + 3272 + 3287 + 3286 + 3285
Sum = 23607

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 23607.
