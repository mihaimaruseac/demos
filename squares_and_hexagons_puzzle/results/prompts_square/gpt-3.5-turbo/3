To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral grid.

The spiral grid follows a pattern where the numbers increase in a spiral shape. Looking at the grid given, we can see that the numbers increase in the following manner:

..22 21 20 19 18
23..  6  1  2 17 
24..  7  0  3 16
25..  8  9  4 15
26 27 10 11 12 13

From the pattern on the grid, we can see that 2026 is in the 21 ring of the spiral as we can find the nearest perfect square below 2026 is 45^2 = 2025 and the nearest perfect square above it is 46^2 = 2116, so 2026 would be in the 21 ring (since it's between 45 and 46 squared).

Now that we know that 2026 is in the 21st ring, we can determine the values of its neighbors:

19  18  17
_26  1(2026)  2
 9  4  3

Now, we find the sum of all 8 neighbors:

19 + 18 + 17 + 26 + 2 + 9 + 4 + 3 = 98

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 98.
