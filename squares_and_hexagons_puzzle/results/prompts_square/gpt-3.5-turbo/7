To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we can locate the position of this number on the spiral.

Since the spiral increases outwards from the center in a clockwise direction, we can see that the number 2026 falls on the outer right side of the spiral. This means that the number to the right of 2026 is 2027, and the numbers to the left, up, and down would be 2025, 2024, and 2041 respectively.

The diagonal neighbors would be the numbers 2023, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Now, we can calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026:

2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2011 + 2041 + 2023 + 2009 + 2010 = 16166

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16166.
