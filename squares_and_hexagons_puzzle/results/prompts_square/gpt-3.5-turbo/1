To calculate the sum of all 8 neighbors of a number in a square grid spiral, we start by analyzing the pattern of the spiral.

We can observe that the numbers on the spiral increase by 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, 16, 16, 24, 24, 24, 24, and so on.

Looking at the first few numbers in the spiral, we can see that the numbers 1, 2, 9, 26, 65, 126, 217, 344, and 521 appear in increasing order. These numbers correspond to the four corners of each "layer" of the spiral, which is laid out on a square grid.
 
To find the sum of neighbors of a number, we need to find the layer in which the number is present. Let's see if 2026 falls into one of these numbers:

521^2 = 271441
522^2 = 272484

The number 2026 falls above 2026 and below 272484. Therefore, it belongs to the square of 522. 

Now let's calculate the values of the eight numbers surrounding 2026 on the same layer:

Corner numbers:
- Top left corner = 522^2 - 21 * 1 = 271441 - 21 = 271420
- Top right corner = 522^2 - 21 * 3 = 271441 - 63 = 271378
- Bottom left corner = 522^2 - 21 * 5 = 271441 - 105 = 271336
- Bottom right corner = 522^2 - 21 * 7 = 271441 - 147 = 271294

Midpoint numbers:
- Directly above = 271441 - 42 = 271399
- Directly below = 271441 + 42 = 271483
- Directly left = 271441 - 84 = 271357
- Directly right = 271441 + 84 = 271525

Adding all these numbers together, we get:
271420 + 271378 + 271336 + 271294 + 271399 + 271483 + 271357 + 271525 = 2174592

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 2174592.
