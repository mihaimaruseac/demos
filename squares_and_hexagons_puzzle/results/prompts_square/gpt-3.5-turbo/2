To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 on the spiral grid.

The spiral grid follows the pattern of increasing the number of cells in each side by 2, starting with 1 in the center. This means that the numbers on the spiral grid are as follows:

1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5

and continue to spiral outwards in a clockwise direction.

The number 2026 falls on the outermost layer of the spiral grid with dimensions 1003 x 1003. The numbers on this outer layer range from 1 to 1002001, with 1002001 being in the bottom right corner.

Since 2026 is not on this outermost layer, it must be in an earlier layer of the spiral grid. By counting the number of numbers in each layer, we find that the sum of numbers in each layer is (2n+1)^2, where n is the layer number. For example, the first layer has 1 number, the second layer has 8 numbers, the third layer has 16 numbers, and so on.

2026 is located in the fourth layer of the spiral grid, which has 16 numbers. The numbers in the fourth layer range from 367-384, with 384 in the top right corner, 367 in the top left corner, and 368 in the bottom left corner.

As 2026 falls in the second half of the fourth layer, the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is: 366 + 381 + 385 + 383 + 2027 + 2025 + 2010 + 2028 = 1605

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 1605.
