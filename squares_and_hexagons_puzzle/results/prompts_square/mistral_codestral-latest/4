Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to understand how the numbers are arranged on the spiral and then determine the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's look at the given small section of the spiral to understand the pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can observe that the numbers are arranged in a square grid with a spiral pattern. The number 1 is at the center, and the numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral.

Let's try to generalize how the numbers are placed. The spiral seems to expand outward in layers or "rings" around the center. Each new layer adds a new ring around the existing spiral.

### Identifying the Ring Structure

Let's try to identify how many numbers are in each ring or layer.

- **Center (Ring 0):** Just the number 1.
- **First Ring (Ring 1):** Numbers 2 to 9. That's 8 numbers.
- **Second Ring (Ring 2):** Numbers 10 to 25. That's 16 numbers.
- **Third Ring (Ring 3):** Numbers 26 to 49. That's 24 numbers.
- And so on...

We can see a pattern here: the number of numbers in each ring increases by 8 as we move outward.

The number of numbers in the nth ring is given by:
- For n = 0: 1 number (just 1)
- For n ≥ 1: 8n numbers

The total number of numbers up to the nth ring is:
- For n = 0: 1
- For n ≥ 1: 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1)

This is because the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2.

### Determining the Ring for Number 2026

Now, we need to find out in which ring the number 2026 falls.

Let's find the largest n such that the total numbers up to ring n is less than or equal to 2026.

Total numbers up to ring n: 1 + 4n(n+1) ≤ 2026

Let's solve for n:

4n(n+1) ≤ 2025
n(n+1) ≤ 506.25

Let's find n:

n² + n - 506.25 ≈ 0

Using the quadratic formula:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*506.25)] / 2
n = [-1 ± sqrt(2025.0001)] / 2
n ≈ [-1 ± 45.0000] / 2

Positive solution:
n ≈ (44) / 2 = 22

So, n = 22.

Let's check:

Total numbers up to ring 22:
1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 4*506 = 1 + 2024 = 2025

Numbers in ring 22: 8*22 = 176

So, ring 22 has numbers from 2026 to 2026 + 175 = 2199.

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in ring 22.

### Position of 2026 in Ring 22

Since 2026 is the first number in ring 22, it's at the "starting corner" of that ring.

Let's visualize the spiral's growth:

- The spiral starts at the center (1).
- Each new ring starts at the top-right corner of the previous ring's square.

For ring n, the numbers are arranged in a square of side length 2n + 1 (since each side adds one more cell than the previous side).

For n=22, the side length is 2*22 + 1 = 45.

The numbers in ring 22 are arranged in a 45x45 square, with 2026 at the top-right corner of this square.

### Coordinates of Numbers in the Spiral

To find the neighbors, it's helpful to assign coordinates to each number. Let's place the center (1) at (0,0).

For any number, we can determine its coordinates based on its position in the spiral.

The spiral moves in the order: right, up, left, down, and so on, increasing the step length after every two directions.

However, a more straightforward approach is to note that for numbers in ring n, their coordinates can be determined based on their position in the ring.

For the first number in ring n (which is the top-right corner of the nth square), its coordinates are (n, -n).

For example:
- Ring 1: first number is 2 at (1, -1)
- Ring 2: first number is 10 at (2, -2)
- ...
- Ring 22: first number is 2026 at (22, -22)

Similarly, the other numbers in the ring follow in a clockwise direction around the square.

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026

2026 is at (22, -22).

The neighbors of a point (x, y) in a grid are:
- (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1) - cardinal directions
- (x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), (x-1, y-1) - diagonal directions

So, the neighbors of (22, -22) are:
1. (23, -22)
2. (21, -22)
3. (22, -21)
4. (22, -23)
5. (23, -21)
6. (23, -23)
7. (21, -21)
8. (21, -23)

Now, we need to find the numbers corresponding to these coordinates.

### Determining Numbers from Coordinates

To find the number at a given coordinate (x, y), we can use the following approach:

For a given (x, y), the number can be determined based on the maximum of |x| and |y|, which gives the ring n.

Then, the position within the ring can be determined based on the direction.

However, this can be complex, so let's find a smarter way.

Notice that for the first number in ring n, it's at (n, -n), and the numbers increase as we move clockwise around the ring.

The numbers in ring n are from:
start = 1 + 4*(n-1)*n (total numbers up to ring n-1) + 1
end = start + 8n - 1

For n=22:
start = 1 + 4*21*22 + 1 = 1 + 1848 + 1 = 1850
end = 1850 + 176 - 1 = 2025

Wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation where ring 22 starts at 2026.

Ah, I see the mistake! Earlier, I thought ring 22 starts at 2026, but actually, the total up to ring 21 is 2025, so ring 22 starts at 2026.

So, the numbers in ring 22 are 2026 to 2199.

Now, the first number in ring 22 is at (22, -22), which is 2026.

The next numbers are placed clockwise around the ring.

The sequence around the ring is:
- Right: (22, -22) to (22, -22 + (2n)) = (22, 22) - but wait, no, the side length is 2n + 1 = 45, so the top side goes from (22, -22) to (-22, -22), which is 45 steps (from x=22 to x=-22 is 44 steps, but including both ends is 45).

Wait, let's think differently.

For ring n, the numbers are arranged in a square of side length 2n + 1, with the first number at the top-right corner (n, -n).

Then, moving right along the top: (n, -n) to (-n, -n) - that's 2n + 1 numbers (from x=n to x=-n).
Then, moving up along the right: (-n, -n) to (-n, n) - 2n + 1 numbers.
Then, moving left along the bottom: (-n, n) to (n, n) - 2n + 1 numbers.
Then, moving down along the left: (n, n) to (n, -n) - 2n + 1 numbers.

But the total should be 8n, which is correct since 4*(2n + 1) - 4 = 8n (since the corners are counted twice in the above).

But actually, the correct count is:
Top: 2n + 1 (from (n,-n) to (-n,-n))
Right: 2n (from (-n,-n+1) to (-n,n))
Bottom: 2n (from (-n+1,n) to (n,n))
Left: 2n (from (n,n-1) to (n,-n+1))
Total: 2n + 1 + 2n + 2n + 2n = 8n + 1, which is off by 1.

Hmm, seems I'm missing something. Maybe the first number is at (n, -n), then next is (n-1, -n), etc., until (-n, -n), then (-n, -n+1), etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the numbers corresponding to the neighbor coordinates.

### Finding Numbers for Neighbor Coordinates

We have the neighbors at:
1. (23, -22)
2. (21, -22)
3. (22, -21)
4. (22, -23)
5. (23, -21)
6. (23, -23)
7. (21, -21)
8. (21, -23)

Now, let's find the numbers for these coordinates.

For a general coordinate (x, y), the number can be determined as follows:

The ring n is max(|x|, |y|).

The position within the ring can be determined based on the direction.

For (x, y) where |x| = |y| = n, it's a corner.

For (x, y) where |x| = n, |y| < n, it's on the top or bottom side.
For (x, y) where |y| = n, |x| < n, it's on the left or right side.

For (23, -22):
n = max(23, 22) = 23
This is in ring 23.

The first number in ring 23 is at (23, -23), which is 1 + 4*22*23 = 2026 + 176 = 2202.

Wait, no. Earlier, ring 22 starts at 2026, has 176 numbers, so ring 23 starts at 2026 + 176 = 2202.

So, the numbers in ring 23 are 2202 to 2202 + 8*23 - 1 = 2202 + 184 - 1 = 2385.

Now, (23, -22) is one step from (23, -23), so it's the second number in ring 23.

So, 2202 is at (23, -23), then next is (22, -23), then (21, -23), ..., (-23, -23), then (-23, -22), etc.

So, (23, -22) is the second number in ring 23: 2203.

Similarly, (21, -22):
n = max(21, 22) = 22
So, in ring 22, which is 2026 to 2199.

The first number in ring 22 is at (22, -22): 2026.

The next is (21, -22): 2027.

Similarly:
(22, -21): n = max(22, 21) = 22
In ring 22, (22, -22) is 2026, then (22, -21) is 2026 + (22 - (-21)) = 2026 + 43 = 2069? Wait, no.

Actually, the order is clockwise around the ring.

For ring n, the order is:
( n, -n) to (-n, -n) - top: 2n + 1 numbers
(-n, -n+1) to (-n, n) - right: 2n numbers
(-n+1, n) to (n, n) - bottom: 2n numbers
( n, n-1) to ( n, -n+1) - left: 2n numbers
Total: 8n numbers.

So, for (22, -21):
It's on the top side, after (22, -22) and before (21, -22).
(22, -22) is first, (22, -21) is second, ..., (-22, -22) is 2n + 1 = 45th.
So, (22, -21) is 2026 + 1 = 2027.

Similarly:
(22, -23): n = max(22, 23) = 23
In ring 23, (23, -23) is first, (22, -23) is second: 2203.

(23, -21): n = 23
(23, -23) is first, (23, -22) is second, (23, -21) is third: 2204.

(23, -23): n = 23, first: 2202.

(21, -21): n = 21
Ring 21 starts at 1 + 4*20*21 = 1 + 1680 = 1681, ends at 1681 + 168 - 1 = 1848.
(21, -21) is the first number in ring 21: 1681.

(21, -23): n = 23
In ring 23, (23, -23) is first, (22, -23) is second, ..., (21, -23) is 3 steps from (23, -23): 2202 + 2 = 2204.

Wait, no. The order is clockwise, so from (23, -23):
1. (23, -23)
2. (23, -22)
3. (23, -21)
...
Then down the right side:
4. (22, -23)
5. (22, -22)
6. (22, -21)
...
Then left along bottom:
...
Then up the left side:
...
So, (21, -23) is the 4 + (23 - 21) = 4 + 2 = 6th number in ring 23: 2202 + 5 = 2207.

Similarly, (21, -21):
n = max(21, 21) = 21
In ring 21, (21, -21) is first: 1681.

### Summing Up the Neighbors

Now, let's list the neighbors with their numbers:

1. (23, -22): 2203
2. (21, -22): 2027
3. (22, -21): 2027
4. (22, -23): 2203
5. (23, -21): 2204
6. (23, -23): 2202
7. (21, -21): 1681
8. (21, -23): 2207

Now, sum these:

2203 (1)
+ 2027 (2)
= 4230

+ 2027 (3)
= 6257

+ 2203 (4)
= 8460

+ 2204 (5)
= 10664

+ 2202 (6)
= 12866

+ 1681 (7)
= 14547

+ 2207 (8)
= 16754

### Verifying the Neighbors

Let me double-check the assignments:

- 2026 is at (22, -22), first in ring 22.
- Neighbors:
  - Right: (23, -22) - second in ring 23: 2203
  - Left: (21, -22) - second in ring 22: 2026 + 1 = 2027
  - Up: (22, -21) - second in ring 22: 2027
  - Down: (22, -23) - second in ring 23: 2203
  - Up-right: (23, -21) - third in ring 23: 2204
  - Up-left: (21, -21) - first in ring 21: 1681
  - Down-right: (23, -23) - first in ring 23: 2202
  - Down-left: (21, -23) - third in ring 23: 2204

Wait, seems I have a discrepancy in (21, -23). Earlier I thought it was 2207, but let's see:

In ring 23, the order is:
1. (23, -23)
2. (23, -22)
3. (23, -21)
...
Then down the right:
4. (22, -23)
5. (22, -22)
6. (22, -21)
...
Then left along bottom:
...
Then up the left:
...
(21, -23) is the 4 + (23 - 21) = 6th number: 2202 + 5 = 2207.

Similarly, (21, -21) is first in ring 21: 1681.

So, the sum is correct.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16754**.
