Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand how the numbers are arranged on the spiral and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Pattern

First, let's visualize the given spiral pattern to understand how the numbers are arranged:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that:
- The number 1 is at the center.
- The numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral fashion.
- Each "layer" of the spiral seems to add numbers in a clockwise manner around the previous layer.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of a given number, we need to determine its position in the spiral. One way to do this is to identify the "ring" or "layer" in which the number resides and its position within that ring.

Let's define the layers (or rings) of the spiral:
- **Layer 0**: Only contains the number 1.
- **Layer 1**: Contains numbers from 2 to 9.
- **Layer 2**: Contains numbers from 10 to 25.
- And so on...

The number of numbers in each layer can be determined by the following pattern:
- Layer 0: 1 number (1)
- Layer 1: 8 numbers (2-9)
- Layer 2: 16 numbers (10-25)
- Layer n: 8n numbers

The total number of numbers up to layer n is the sum of the numbers in all previous layers plus the numbers in layer n. The sum of the first n layers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where each layer adds 8 more numbers than the previous (starting from 8 in layer 1):

Total numbers up to layer n = 1 (layer 0) + 8 + 16 + ... + 8n = 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1)

But let's verify this with the given layers:
- Up to layer 0: 1 number.
- Up to layer 1: 1 + 8 = 9 numbers (2-9).
- Up to layer 2: 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 numbers (10-25).
This seems correct.

So, to find the layer of a number N:
Find the smallest n such that 1 + 4n(n+1) ≥ N.

Let's compute this for N = 2026.

### Finding the Layer for N = 2026

We need to find the smallest integer n such that:

1 + 4n(n + 1) ≥ 2026

Let's solve for n:

4n(n + 1) ≥ 2025
n(n + 1) ≥ 2025 / 4
n(n + 1) ≥ 506.25

Now, let's find n:

n² + n - 506.25 ≥ 0

Solving the quadratic equation n² + n - 506.25 = 0:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*506.25)] / 2
n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2025)] / 2
n = [-1 ± sqrt(2026)] / 2

sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01

So,
n = (-1 + 45.01)/2 ≈ 44.01 / 2 ≈ 22.005

Since n must be an integer, we take the ceiling of 22.005, which is 23.

Let's check n=22 and n=23:

For n=22:
1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 4*506 = 1 + 2024 = 2025

For n=23:
1 + 4*23*24 = 1 + 4*552 = 1 + 2208 = 2209

So, up to layer 22, we have 2025 numbers (from 1 to the last number in layer 22), which is 2025.

Therefore, the number 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Determining the Position of 2026 in Layer 23

Layer 23 starts at 2026 and has 8*23 = 184 numbers (from 2026 to 2026 + 183 = 2208).

So, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Understanding the Structure of a Layer

Each layer n (for n ≥ 1) is a square ring around the previous layer. The numbers in layer n are arranged in a square with side length 2n + 1 (since layer 1 has side length 3, layer 2 has side length 5, etc.).

For layer n, the numbers are arranged as follows:
- The first number is at the bottom-right corner of the square.
- Then, numbers increase as we move up the right side, then left across the top, then down the left side, and finally right across the bottom to the next layer's starting point.

For layer 23:
- Side length = 2*23 + 1 = 47.
- The numbers are arranged in a 47x47 square.
- The first number (2026) is at the bottom-right corner of this square.

Let's visualize the positions in layer 23:

Imagine a 47x47 grid where the numbers are filled in a clockwise spiral starting from the bottom-right corner with 2026.

The positions can be described as follows:
- Bottom-right corner: (47, 1) - 2026
- Moving up the right side: (46, 1) to (1, 1) - numbers 2027 to 2026 + 46 = 2072
- Top-left corner: (1, 1) - 2072
- Moving left across the top: (1, 2) to (1, 47) - numbers 2073 to 2026 + 46 + 46 = 2118
- Top-right corner: (1, 47) - 2118
- Moving down the left side: (2, 47) to (47, 47) - numbers 2119 to 2026 + 46*3 = 2164
- Bottom-left corner: (47, 47) - 2164
- Moving right across the bottom: (47, 46) to (47, 2) - numbers 2165 to 2026 + 46*4 - 1 = 2208 (since the last number is connected to the next layer)

Wait, let's clarify the numbering:

Total numbers in layer 23: 184.

Starting at bottom-right (47,1): 2026
Up right side: (46,1) to (1,1): 46 numbers (2027 to 2072)
Left top side: (1,2) to (1,47): 46 numbers (2073 to 2118)
Down left side: (2,47) to (47,47): 46 numbers (2119 to 2164)
Right bottom side: (47,46) to (47,2): 45 numbers (2165 to 2208) [since the last number is connected to the next layer's start]

But total should be 184:
1 (bottom-right) + 46 (up) + 46 (left) + 46 (down) + 45 (right) = 1 + 46*3 + 45 = 1 + 138 + 45 = 184. Correct.

So, 2026 is at position (47,1) in layer 23.

### Finding the Neighbors of 2026

The number 2026 is at the bottom-right corner of its layer. Its neighbors are the numbers adjacent to it in the grid.

In a grid, a number at position (x,y) has neighbors at:
- (x±1, y)
- (x, y±1)
- (x±1, y±1) [diagonals]

But since the spiral is on a square grid, we consider all 8 possible adjacent positions, even if some might be outside the current layer (but in this case, since 2026 is at the corner, some neighbors will be from the previous layer).

However, since 2026 is at the bottom-right corner of its layer, its immediate neighbors are:
1. To its right: (47,2) - this is the next number in the sequence, which is 2027.
2. To its left: (47,47) - this is the bottom-left corner of the layer, which is 2164.
3. Above it: (46,1) - which is 2027 (same as right, but wait no, the right is (47,2), above is (46,1) which is 2027? Wait, no, the sequence is:

Wait, let's clarify the sequence:

Starting at (47,1): 2026
Up to (1,1): (46,1):2027, (45,1):2028, ..., (1,1):2026+46=2072
Left to (1,47): (1,2):2073, ..., (1,47):2118
Down to (47,47): (2,47):2119, ..., (47,47):2164
Right to (47,2): (47,46):2165, ..., (47,2):2208

So, the neighbors of (47,1) are:
- Right: (47,2) - 2027
- Left: (47,47) - 2164
- Up: (46,1) - 2027 (same as right, but position is different)
Wait, no, the number above is (46,1), which is 2027, but the number to the right is (47,2), which is 2073.

Wait, let's list the numbers around (47,1):

The sequence around (47,1):
- (47,1): 2026
- (46,1): 2027 (up)
- (45,1): 2028
- ...
- (1,1): 2072
- (1,2): 2073 (right)
- (1,3): 2074
- ...
- (1,47): 2118
- (2,47): 2119 (left)
- ...
- (47,47): 2164
- (47,46): 2165
- ...
- (47,2): 2208

Wait, the number to the right of (47,1) is (47,2), which is 2208, not 2027. The number to the right is the last in the right side of the layer, which is 2208.

Similarly, the number above is (46,1), which is 2027.

The number to the left is (47,47), which is 2164.

So, the immediate neighbors are:
1. Right: (47,2) - 2208
2. Left: (47,47) - 2164
3. Up: (46,1) - 2027
4. Down: (1,1) - 2072 (but (1,1) is not directly down from (47,1), so maybe not a neighbor in the grid sense)

Wait, in grid terms, the neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells, even if they're not in the same layer. So, the 8 neighbors are:
- (46,1), (46,2)
- (47,2), (48,2) [but (48,2) is outside the layer]
- (48,1), (47,0) [outside]
- (46,0) [outside]

But since the grid is infinite, we can assume that the spiral extends infinitely, so all 8 positions are valid, but some may be in previous layers.

But since 2026 is at the corner of layer 23, its neighbors are:
1. (46,1): 2027
2. (46,2): ?
3. (47,2): 2208
4. (48,2): ?
5. (48,1): ?
6. (48,0): ?
7. (47,0): ?
8. (46,0): ?

But we need to find the actual numbers at these positions.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

### Alternative Approach: Using Mathematical Formulas

There's a known mathematical formula to find the position of a number in the Ulam spiral, which is similar to this problem. The position (x,y) of a number n can be determined as follows:

1. Find the ring (or layer) k such that the number is in the k-th ring.
2. The side length of the k-th ring is 2k + 1.
3. The numbers in the k-th ring are from (2k + 1)^2 - 4k to (2k + 1)^2.

But this might not directly help with finding neighbors. Alternatively, we can find the coordinates based on the number.

Given a number n, we can find its coordinates (x,y) as follows:

1. Find the largest odd integer s such that s² ≥ n. Then the ring number is k = (s - 1)/2.
2. The numbers in the k-th ring are from (s - 2)^2 + 1 to s².
3. The position within the ring can be determined by the difference between n and the start of the ring.

But this seems complex for finding neighbors. Maybe it's better to stick with the spiral construction.

### Reconstructing the Spiral Around 2026

Given that 2026 is the first number in layer 23, let's reconstruct the numbers around it.

Layer 23 has side length 47 (2*23 + 1). The numbers are arranged as follows:

Start at bottom-right corner: (47,1) = 2026
Move up the right side: (46,1) = 2027, ..., (1,1) = 2026 + 46 = 2072
Move left across the top: (1,2) = 2073, ..., (1,47) = 2073 + 45 = 2118
Move down the left side: (2,47) = 2119, ..., (47,47) = 2119 + 45 = 2164
Move right across the bottom: (47,46) = 2165, ..., (47,2) = 2165 + 44 = 2208

Now, the neighbors of 2026 at (47,1) are:
1. Right: (47,2) = 2208
2. Left: (47,47) = 2164
3. Up: (46,1) = 2027
4. Down: (1,1) = 2072
5. Diagonally up-right: (46,2) = 2073
6. Diagonally up-left: (46,47) = ?
7. Diagonally down-right: (1,2) = 2073
8. Diagonally down-left: (1,47) = 2118

Now, let's find (46,47):
This is the point just left of the top-left corner. The sequence is:
From (1,47) = 2118, moving down to (47,47) = 2164, so (46,47) = 2118 + 45 = 2163.

So, the 8 neighbors are:
1. (47,2): 2208
2. (47,47): 2164
3. (46,1): 2027
4. (1,1): 2072
5. (46,2): 2073
6. (46,47): 2163
7. (1,2): 2073
8. (1,47): 2118

Now, let's list them:
1. 2208
2. 2164
3. 2027
4. 2072
5. 2073
6. 2163
7. 2073
8. 2118

Now, let's sum them up:
2208 + 2164 = 4372
4372 + 2027 = 6399
6399 + 2072 = 8471
8471 + 2073 = 10544
10544 + 2163 = 12707
12707 + 2073 = 14780
14780 + 2118 = 16898

### Verifying the Sum

Let me add them step by step to ensure no mistakes:

1. 2208 + 2164 = 4372
2. 4372 + 2027 = 6399
3. 6399 + 2072 = 8471
4. 8471 + 2073 = 10544
5. 10544 + 2163 = 12707
6. 12707 + 2073 = 14780
7. 14780 + 2118 = 16898

The sum is indeed 16,898.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16,898**.
