Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand how the numbers are arranged on the spiral and how to find the neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the given spiral layout to understand the pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can observe that the number 1 is at the center of the spiral. The spiral expands outward in layers, with each layer adding numbers in a clockwise direction. Here's how the layers are structured:

1. **Layer 0**: Just the center number, 1.
2. **Layer 1**: Numbers from 2 to 9.
   - Starts at the right of 1 (number 2), then moves up (3), left (4), down (5), left (6), down (7), right (8), up (9), and then left to start the next layer.
3. **Layer 2**: Numbers from 10 onwards, and so on.

However, looking at the given snippet, it seems that the spiral is arranged such that each new layer starts to the left of the previous layer's bottom-left corner. This is a bit different from the standard Ulam spiral where each layer starts to the right of the previous layer's top-right corner.

Given the snippet:
- 1 is at the center.
- To its right is 2, up is 3, left is 4, down is 5, left is 6, down is 7, right is 8, up is 9.
- Then the next layer starts at 10 to the left of 7, and so on.

This seems to be a spiral that grows by adding a new "ring" around the previous one, with each ring having numbers increasing in a clockwise direction starting from the left.

### Determining the Position of a Number

To find the neighbors of 2026, we need to determine its position on this spiral. This involves figuring out in which layer (or ring) the number 2026 lies and its exact position within that layer.

First, let's try to find a general formula or pattern for the numbers in the spiral.

#### Observing the Pattern

Let's list out the numbers and see how they're arranged:

- **Layer 0**: 1 (center)
- **Layer 1**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  - These are the numbers immediately surrounding 1.
- **Layer 2**: 10, 11, ..., up to some number.
  - The numbers in Layer 2 form a larger square around Layer 1.
- And so on.

The number of numbers in each layer seems to be 8 for Layer 1, 16 for Layer 2, 24 for Layer 3, etc. That is, the nth layer (n ≥ 1) has 8n numbers.

Let's verify:

- Layer 1: 8 numbers (2-9)
- Layer 2: 16 numbers (10-25)
- Layer 3: 24 numbers (26-49)
- Layer 4: 32 numbers (50-81)
- ...

This seems correct: each layer adds 8 more numbers than the previous layer.

#### Finding the Layer for 2026

Now, let's find out in which layer 2026 lies.

First, find the total numbers up to the (n-1)th layer:

Total numbers up to Layer (n-1) = 1 (center) + 8 + 16 + ... + 8(n-1) = 1 + 8[(n-1)n/2] = 1 + 4(n-1)n

We need to find the smallest n such that the total numbers up to Layer n is ≥ 2026.

So, 1 + 4(n-1)n ≥ 2026
=> 4(n-1)n ≥ 2025
=> (n-1)n ≥ 506.25

Let's solve for n:

n² - n - 506.25 ≥ 0

Solving the quadratic equation n² - n - 506.25 = 0:

n = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*506.25)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(2025.25)] / 2

sqrt(2025.25) ≈ 45.006

So, n ≈ (1 + 45.006)/2 ≈ 23.003

So, n = 23.

Let's check:

Total numbers up to Layer 22:

1 + 4*22*21 = 1 + 4*462 = 1 + 1848 = 1849

Total numbers up to Layer 23:

1 + 4*23*22 = 1 + 2028 = 2029

So, Layer 23 starts at 2029 and goes up to 2029 + 8*23 - 1 = 2029 + 184 - 1 = 2212.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because Layer 23 should have 8*23 = 184 numbers, starting at 2029 and ending at 2029 + 184 - 1 = 2212.

But 2026 is between 2029 and 2212, so it's in Layer 23.

But let's see the total numbers up to Layer 22 is 1849, so Layer 23 starts at 1850 and goes up to 1850 + 183 = 2032.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with the previous calculation. Let me re-express the total numbers up to Layer n.

Actually, the total numbers up to Layer n is:

1 (center) + 8*1 + 8*2 + ... + 8*n = 1 + 8*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1)

So, for n=22:

1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2028 = 2029

Layer 23 starts at 2029 and has 8*23 = 184 numbers, so goes up to 2029 + 183 = 2212.

But 2026 is between 2029 and 2212, so it's in Layer 23.

But the position within the layer is 2026 - 2028 = 2026 - (1 + 4*22*23) = 2026 - 2029 = -3, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The total numbers up to Layer 22 is 2029, so Layer 23 starts at 2029.

So, position of 2026 in Layer 23 is 2026 - 2028 = -2, which is impossible.

I think I made a mistake in calculating the total numbers up to Layer n.

Let me re-calculate:

Total numbers up to Layer n is 1 (center) + 8*1 + 8*2 + ... + 8*n = 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1)

For n=22:

1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2028 = 2029

So, Layer 23 starts at 2029.

But 2026 is less than 2029, so it's in Layer 22.

Let me find the correct n where the total up to Layer n-1 < 2026 ≤ total up to Layer n.

For n=22:

Total up to Layer 21: 1 + 4*21*22 = 1 + 1848 = 1849

Total up to Layer 22: 1 + 4*22*23 = 2029

So, 1849 < 2026 ≤ 2029, so 2026 is in Layer 22.

Position within Layer 22: 2026 - 1849 = 177

Layer 22 has 8*22 = 176 numbers, so 2026 is the 177th number in Layer 22.

But Layer 22 has only 176 numbers, so this is impossible.

Wait, no. Layer 22 starts at 1850 (since total up to Layer 21 is 1849), and has 176 numbers, so goes up to 1850 + 175 = 2025.

So, 2026 is not in Layer 22.

Next, Layer 23 starts at 2026, has 184 numbers, up to 2026 + 183 = 2209.

So, 2026 is the first number in Layer 23.

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in Layer 23.

### Position of 2026 in the Spiral

Now, let's determine the coordinates of 2026 on the grid.

The spiral starts at the center with 1. Each layer is a square that expands outward. The side length of the nth layer is 2n + 1 (since it's centered).

For Layer 23:
- Side length = 2*23 + 1 = 47
- The layer starts at the bottom-left corner of the previous layer's top-left corner.

But given the initial snippet, the spiral seems to be arranged such that each new layer starts to the left of the previous layer's bottom-left corner.

Let me try to model the coordinates.

Assume the center (1) is at (0,0).

Layer 1:
- Starts at (1,0): 2
- Up to (1,1): 3
- Left to (0,1): 4
- Down to (-1,1): 5
- Left to (-1,0): 6
- Down to (-1,-1): 7
- Right to (0,-1): 8
- Up to (1,-1): 9
- Then the next layer starts at (-2,-1): 10

Layer 2:
- Starts at (-2,-1): 10
- Right to (-2,0): 11
- Right to (-2,1): 12
- Right to (-2,2): 13
- Down to (-1,2): 14
- Down to (0,2): 15
- Down to (1,2): 16
- Down to (2,2): 17
- Left to (2,1): 18
- Left to (2,0): 19
- Left to (2,-1): 20
- Left to (2,-2): 21
- Up to (1,-2): 22
- Up to (0,-2): 23
- Up to (-1,-2): 24
- Up to (-2,-2): 25
- Then next layer starts at (-3,-2): 26

This seems to be the pattern: each new layer starts one step to the left and one step down from the previous layer's starting point.

Given that, the starting point of Layer n is at (-n, -n + 1).

For Layer 23, it starts at (-23, -22).

The numbers in Layer 23 are arranged as follows:
1. Start at (-23, -22): 2026
2. Move right along y = -22: (-22, -22), ..., (-23 + 46, -22) = (23, -22): 2026 + 46 - 1 = 2071
   - Wait, no. The side length is 47, so 46 steps to the right (from -23 to 23).
   - So, positions are (-23 + k, -22) for k=0 to 46: numbers 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071
3. Then move up along x = 23: (23, -21), ..., (23, 23): 2072 to 2072 + 45 = 2117
4. Then move left along y = 23: (22, 23), ..., (-23, 23): 2118 to 2118 + 45 = 2163
5. Then move down along x = -23: (-23, 22), ..., (-23, -22): 2164 to 2164 + 45 = 2209

But 2026 is the first number in Layer 23, at (-23, -22).

### Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

The neighbors of a point (x, y) are:
1. (x+1, y)
2. (x+1, y+1)
3. (x, y+1)
4. (x-1, y+1)
5. (x-1, y)
6. (x-1, y-1)
7. (x, y-1)
8. (x+1, y-1)

For 2026 at (-23, -22):

1. (-22, -22)
2. (-22, -21)
3. (-23, -21)
4. (-24, -21)
5. (-24, -22)
6. (-24, -23)
7. (-23, -23)
8. (-22, -23)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

#### Finding Numbers at Neighboring Positions

We need to determine which numbers are at these coordinates.

From the spiral construction:

- The first number in Layer n is at (-n, -n + 1).
- The numbers in Layer n are arranged in a clockwise square.

Given that, the numbers in Layer n are:

1. Start at (-n, -n + 1): first number
2. Move right along y = -n + 1: (-n + k, -n + 1) for k=1 to 2n: numbers first + k to first + 2n
3. Move up along x = n: (n, -n + 1 + k) for k=1 to 2n: numbers first + 2n + k
4. Move left along y = n: (n - k, n) for k=1 to 2n: numbers first + 4n + k
5. Move down along x = -n: (-n, n - k) for k=1 to 2n - 1: numbers first + 6n + k

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to note that the numbers in Layer n are from first to first + 8n - 1.

Given that, the position of a number in Layer n can be determined by its offset from the first number in the layer.

For 2026, which is the first number in Layer 23, its offset is 0.

Now, let's find the numbers at the neighboring positions.

1. (-22, -22):
   - This is in Layer 22, since |x| = 22, |y| = 22, and the maximum in Layer 22 is 2n = 44, so it's in Layer 22.
   - The first number in Layer 22 is at (-22, -21).
   - The numbers in Layer 22 are arranged similarly to Layer 23 but with n=22.
   - The first number in Layer 22 is at (-22, -21), which is 1 + 4*21*22 = 1 + 1848 = 1849.
   - The numbers in Layer 22 are from 1849 to 1849 + 8*22 - 1 = 1849 + 175 = 2024.
   - The position (-22, -22) is one step down from (-22, -21), so it's the second number in Layer 22: 1850.

2. (-22, -21):
   - This is the first number in Layer 22: 1849.

3. (-23, -21):
   - This is in Layer 23, since |x| = 23, |y| = 21, and the maximum in Layer 23 is 46, so it's in Layer 23.
   - The first number in Layer 23 is 2026 at (-23, -22).
   - The numbers in Layer 23 are arranged as follows:
     - Start at (-23, -22): 2026
     - Move right along y = -22: (-23 + k, -22) for k=1 to 46: 2027 to 2072
     - Move up along x = 23: (23, -22 + k) for k=1 to 46: 2073 to 2118
     - Move left along y = 23: (23 - k, 23) for k=1 to 46: 2119 to 2164
     - Move down along x = -23: (-23, 23 - k) for k=1 to 45: 2165 to 2209
   - (-23, -21) is one step up from (-23, -22), so it's the second number in Layer 23: 2027.

4. (-24, -21):
   - This is in Layer 24, since |x| = 24, |y| = 21, and the maximum in Layer 24 is 48.
   - The first number in Layer 24 is at (-24, -23), which is 1 + 4*23*24 = 1 + 2184 = 2185.
   - The numbers in Layer 24 are from 2185 to 2185 + 8*24 - 1 = 2185 + 191 = 2376.
   - The position (-24, -21) is two steps up from (-24, -23), so it's the third number in Layer 24: 2186.

5. (-24, -22):
   - This is one step left from (-23, -22), which is the first number in Layer 23: 2026.
   - But (-24, -22) is not adjacent to (-23, -22) in the spiral's numbering, so this seems incorrect.
   - Wait, the spiral's numbering is such that each layer is a square, and the numbers increase as we go around the square.
   - The neighbor to the left of (-23, -22) is (-24, -22), which is the first number in Layer 24: 2185.

6. (-24, -23):
   - This is the first number in Layer 24: 2185.

7. (-23, -23):
   - This is one step down from (-23, -22), so it's the last number in Layer 23: 2209.

8. (-22, -23):
   - This is in Layer 22, since |x| = 22, |y| = 23, and the maximum in Layer 22 is 44, so it's not in Layer 22.
   - Actually, Layer 22 goes up to (22, 22), so (-22, -23) is outside Layer 22.
   - The first number in Layer 23 is at (-23, -22), and the numbers in Layer 23 are arranged as described.
   - The position (-22, -23) is one step up and one step right from (-23, -22), which is the first number in Layer 23: 2026.
   - The number at (-22, -23) is the second number in the "up" segment of Layer 23: 2074.

Wait, let's clarify the numbering in Layer 23:

Layer 23 starts at (-23, -22): 2026
1. Right along y = -22: (-23 + k, -22) for k=1 to 46: 2027 to 2072
   - (-22, -22): 2027
2. Up along x = 23: (23, -22 + k) for k=1 to 46: 2073 to 2118
   - (23, -21): 2074
   - (23, -20): 2075
   - ...
   - (23, 23): 2118
3. Left along y = 23: (23 - k, 23) for k=1 to 46: 2119 to 2164
4. Down along x = -23: (-23, 23 - k) for k=1 to 45: 2165 to 2209

So, (-22, -23) is not in Layer 23. It seems I made a mistake in identifying the neighbors.

Actually, the neighbors of (-23, -22) are:

1. (-22, -22): adjacent right
   - This is in Layer 22: 1850
2. (-22, -21): adjacent right and up
   - This is in Layer 22: 1849
3. (-23, -21): adjacent up
   - This is in Layer 23: 2027
4. (-24, -21): adjacent left and up
   - This is in Layer 24: 2186
5. (-24, -22): adjacent left
   - This is in Layer 24: 2185
6. (-24, -23): adjacent left and down
   - This is in Layer 24: 2185 (same as (-24, -22)? Wait, no, the first number in Layer 24 is at (-24, -23): 2185
   - The next is (-24, -22): 2186
   - Then (-24, -21): 2187
   - So (-24, -23): 2185
7. (-23, -23): adjacent down
   - This is in Layer 23: 2209
8. (-22, -23): adjacent right and down
   - This is in Layer 22: 2025

Wait, but Layer 22 goes up to 2025, and Layer 23 starts at 2026. So (-22, -23) is in Layer 22.

But Layer 22 has numbers up to 2025, and (-22, -23) is the last number in Layer 22: 2025.

Similarly, (-23, -23) is the last number in Layer 23: 2209.

So the neighbors are:

1. (-22, -22): 1850
2. (-22, -21): 1849
3. (-23, -21): 2027
4. (-24, -21): 2187
5. (-24, -22): 2186
6. (-24, -23): 2185
7. (-23, -23): 2209
8. (-22, -23): 2025

Now, let's sum these neighbors:

1850 (1)
+1849 (2) = 3699
+2027 (3) = 5726
+2187 (4) = 7913
+2186 (5) = 10099
+2185 (6) = 12284
+2209 (7) = 14493
+2025 (8) = 16518

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16518**.
