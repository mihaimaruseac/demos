First one computes the “coordinates’’ of 2026 in the Ulam‐spiral and then reads off the eight surrounding values.  A quick way is:

– 2025 = 45² sits at (22, −22).  
– The very next step (2026) is one step to the right, at (23, −22).  

Labeling (x,y) in the usual way (right=+x, up=+y), the eight neighbors of 2026=(23, −22) are

(22, −23), (23, −23), (24, −23)  
(22, −22),           (24, −22)  
(22, −21), (23, −21), (24, −21)

One finds their values by noting on which ring (and which segment of the ring) each falls:

(22,−23)=2208,  (23,−23)=2209,  (24,−23)=2210  
(22,−22)=2025,             (24,−22)=2211  
(22,−21)=1850,  (23,−21)=2027,  (24,−21)=2212

Summing these eight numbers gives

2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212=16952.
