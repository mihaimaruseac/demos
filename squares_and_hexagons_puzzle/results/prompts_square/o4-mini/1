To locate 2026 in the Ulam‐spiral one shows that it lies on “ring” k=23 at coordinates (x,y)=(23,−22).  Its eight neighbors are at

(22,−23), (23,−23), (24,−23),
(22,−22),           (24,−22),
(22,−21), (23,−21), (24,−21)

and one computes their values (by the standard “ring” formula) to be

2208, 2209, 2210,
2025,       2211,
1850, 2027, 2212.

Their sum is  
2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
