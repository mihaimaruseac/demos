First note that 2026 sits at coordinates (23, −22) in the usual “square‐spiral” (with 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), etc.).  One finds the eight surrounding cells to be

(22, −23)=2208,  (23, −23)=2209,  (24, −23)=2210  
(22, −22)=2025,            (24, −22)=2211  
(22, −21)=1850,  (23, −21)=2027,  (24, −21)=2212  

Adding these eight gives

2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
