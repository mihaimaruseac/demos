Let (x,y) be the Cartesian coordinates of 2026 in the Ulam‐spiral (with 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), …, turning counter‐clockwise).  One finds that 2026 sits at (23, −22).  Its eight neighbours are then at

(23, −21), (24, −21), (22, −21),  
(24, −22),        (22, −22),  
(23, −23), (24, −23), (22, −23).  

Computing each of those eight entries by the usual “layer‐and‐offset” formula for the spiral gives

(23, −21)=2027  
(24, −21)=2212  
(22, −21)=1850  
(24, −22)=2211  
(22, −22)=2025  
(23, −23)=2209  
(24, −23)=2210  
(22, −23)=2208  

and their sum is

2027+2212+1850+2211+2025+2209+2210+2208 = 16 952.
