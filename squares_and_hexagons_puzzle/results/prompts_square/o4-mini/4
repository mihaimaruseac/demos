Number the spiral in the usual way with 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), …  so that the “rings’’ are

– ring k has radius k, and ends at (k,–k) with value (2k+1)².  
– ring 22 ends at (22,–22) with 45²=2025.  
– thus 2026 sits at (23,–22), the first point of ring 23.  

The eight neighbours of 2026=(23,–22) are at

 (22,–23), (23,–23), (24,–23),
 (22,–22),          (24,–22),
 (22,–21), (23,–21), (24,–21).

One checks

 (22,–23)=2208,  (23,–23)=2209,  (24,–23)=2210  
 (22,–22)=2025,               (24,–22)=2211  
 (22,–21)=1850,  (23,–21)=2027,  (24,–21)=2212

and their sum is

 2208+2209+2210 +2025+2211 +1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
