To locate 2026 in the “square‐spiral” one shows that it sits at coordinates (23, −22).  Its eight neighbours are at

(22, −23), (23, −23), (24, −23),  
(22, −22),           (24, −22),  
(22, −21), (23, −21), (24, −21),

whose values turn out to be

2208, 2209, 2210, 2025, 2211, 1850, 2027, 2212.

Summing these eight gives

2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
