Okay, so I need to figure out the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this square spiral of natural numbers. Let me start by recalling how the square spiral works. 

First, the spiral starts with 1 at the center, then goes clockwise, adding layers or "rings" around it. Each complete ring adds a layer around the previous square. For example, the first ring (center) is just 1. The second ring includes numbers from 2 to 9, forming a 3x3 square. The third ring includes numbers from 10 to 25, forming a 5x5 square, and so on. Each ring's side length increases by 2 each time: 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc. 

So, if I can figure out which ring the number 2026 is in, I can determine its coordinates and then find its neighbors. 

First, let's find the ring number. The numbers in the rings are as follows:

- Ring 0: 1 (1^2)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (3^2 = 9)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (5^2 = 25)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (7^2 = 49)
- ...
- Ring n: (2n+1)^2

So, the starting number of ring n is (2n-1)^2 + 1 and the ending number is (2n+1)^2. Wait, actually, let me check that. For example, ring 1 (the second ring) starts at 2 and ends at 9. So if n is the ring number, starting from 0, then the side length is 2n + 1. So the last number in ring n is (2n + 1)^2. So the starting number of ring n is (2(n-1) + 1)^2 + 1. For example, ring 1 (n=1) starts at (2(0) +1)^2 +1 = 1 + 1 = 2. That works.

So, given a number, say 2026, we need to find the ring n where (2(n-1)+1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2n +1)^2. Let me solve for n here. Let me compute.

Let me denote the side length of the square in ring n as s = 2n + 1. Therefore, the last number in ring n is s^2. Therefore, to find n for 2026, we need to find the smallest integer n where (2n +1)^2 ≥ 2026. 

So, take the square root of 2026. Let me compute sqrt(2026). 

Well, sqrt(2025) is 45, since 45^2 = 2025. Therefore, sqrt(2026) is just a bit more than 45. Therefore, 2n +1 must be 45 + something. Wait, but since 2026 is just 1 more than 45^2. Therefore, 2026 is in the ring where s = 45 + 2? Wait, no. Wait, s is 2n +1, and the last number in ring n is s^2. Since 2026 is just 1 more than 45^2, that would mean that it's in the next ring. Wait, the ring where s = 47? Because 45^2 = 2025, which is the last number of ring n where s=45. Then the next ring, s=47, starts at 45^2 + 1 = 2026. Therefore, 2026 is the first number in the next ring. Wait, so is that correct? If ring n has side length s = 2n + 1, and the last number of that ring is s^2. Therefore, the next ring would have side length s + 2, which would be s' = s + 2 = 2(n+1) + 1? Wait, solving for s':

If original side length is s = 2n + 1, then the next side length is 2(n+1) + 1 = 2n + 3 = s + 2. So yes. 

So if 2025 is s^2 where s = 45 = 2n + 1, then n = (s -1)/2 = (45 -1)/2 = 22. Therefore, ring n=22 has side length 45, and ends at 2025. Then the next ring, ring n=23, has side length 47 and starts at 2026. Therefore, 2026 is the first number in ring 23. 

Therefore, the coordinates of 2026. Now, I need to figure out where exactly in the spiral 2026 is located. Since it's the first number in ring 23, that would be just after 2025. The spiral goes clockwise, starting at the center. So when moving from one ring to the next, the next number is to the right of the previous last number. 

But let me think about how the spiral builds up. After completing a ring, the next number is added on the next ring. For example, in the 3x3 square, the last number is 9 at the center-right. Then the next number, 10, would be to the left of 9? Wait, no. Let me think of the standard spiral:

Starting at 1 (center), then moving right: 2, 3, 4, then down: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then left: 10, 11, 12... So after finishing the 3x3 square, the numbers go from 1 to 9. Then the next number, 10, is to the left of 9. Then continues counterclockwise? Wait no, the spiral is clockwise. So after going down to 9, then you go left. So from 9, moving left to 10, 11, 12. Then up to the top of that side. Then right again. 

But in any case, for the first number in a new ring (after completing the square), it's located at the position just to the left of the previous last number, which was at the center-right. So in the 3x3 grid, the last number is 9, located at the middle right of the square. Then 10 is to the left of 9, starting the next side. Therefore, in the 5x5 grid, the first number 10 is on the upper side? Wait, perhaps coordinates will help here. 

Perhaps I need to assign coordinates to the numbers. Let's consider the center (number 1) at coordinates (0,0). Then moving right increases the x-coordinate, moving up increases the y-coordinate. Let me think. 

In the standard square spiral, the direction changes as follows: right, up, left, down, repeating. Each time completing a layer. 

But to model coordinates, maybe there's a formula or way to calculate the position. Alternatively, since we know that 2026 is the first number in the ring with side length 47 (s=47), which starts at 2026. So that ring starts at position... Hmm. 

Alternatively, since each ring has a side length of 2n + 1, with n=23, s=47. Wait, n=23 would correspond to s=2*23 + 1? Wait, earlier we saw that for s=45, n=22. Wait, perhaps my ring numbering is conflicting. Wait earlier, for s=2n + 1, with n starting at 0. For example, ring 0: s=1, ring 1: s=3, ring 2: s=5, etc. Therefore, ring k has side length 2k + 1. Therefore, to find which ring contains the number 2026, we need to find k where (2k -1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k + 1)^2. Wait, no, the last number in ring k is (2k + 1)^2. Therefore, solving for k such that (2k + 1)^2 ≥ 2026. 

Given that sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01... So since 45^2 = 2025, as before. Therefore, (2k + 1) must be 45 for the previous ring and then 47 for the next ring. Therefore, solving 2k + 1 = 45 gives k=22. Therefore, ring k=22 is the ring with side length 45, ending at 2025. Then the next ring, k=23, has side length 47 and starts at 2026. 

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in ring k=23. So where is the first number of each ring located? Let's think. 

When you complete a ring, the next number is added by moving to the right? Or which direction? Let me think of the transition between rings. 

Let me take an example with smaller numbers. For example, after 1 (center), the next ring starts with 2. To get from 1 to 2, you move right. Then 2 to 3 right, then down, left, left, down, left, up, etc. 

But when you finish a ring, where do you move to start the next? Taking the example of moving from ring 0 (just 1) to ring 1. The last number in ring 0 is 1. Then you move right to 2. Then up to 3, then left to 4, then left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9. So the first number in ring 1 (which starts at 2) is to the right of 1. 

Similarly, when finishing ring 1 (last number 9), then the next number 10 is to the left of 9? Let's see. The spiral goes clockwise, so after 9, you turn left (which direction?), but depending on the direction you were moving. Let me think. 

After the 3x3 grid, the movement is: starting at 1, moving right to 2, 3, 4. Then down to 5, 6, 7. Then left to 8, 9. Then to continue the spiral, you would turn left again (from direction left, turning left would be up) and move up. So from 9, moving up would be to the position above 9. But since we are in a 3x3 grid, the number after 9 is 10, which would be the next number. So the coordinates of 9 are (1, 0) assuming center is (0,0). Wait, let me actually assign coordinates to the 3x3 grid. 

Let me sketch the coordinates. 

The center is (0,0) for 1. Then moving right, so (1,0) is 2, (2,0) is 3. Then down to (2,-1) is 4, (2,-2) is 5. Then left to (1,-2) is 6, (0,-2) is 7. Then up to (-1,-2) is 8, (-2,-2) is 9? Wait, but in the standard spiral it's 9, then 10 would be (-2,-1)? Wait, if we have:

After reaching 9 at (-2,-2)? Wait maybe my coordinate system is messed up. Let me get a standard square spiral and assign coordinates properly.

Let me take the example given in the problem statement. The numbers are arranged as:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

Wait, that seems like an incomplete spiral. Let me think. The bottom row is ... 7 8 9, so 7, 8, 9 is on the bottom (probably y = -something). The middle row is 6 1 2, so 6 is left, 1 is center, 2 is right. The upper row is 5 4 3. So maybe if we consider:

The coordinates for 1 is (0,0).

Looking at the first diagram:

Top row (probably y=1): ... 5 4 3 ...

Middle row (y=0): ... 6 1 2 ...

Bottom row (y=-1): ... 7 8 9 ...

But x coordinates? Let's suppose that in the middle row (y=0), ... 6 is at x=-1, 1 at x=0, 2 at x=+1 ...

Similarly, top row ... 5 at x=-1, 4 at x=0, 3 at x=+1 ...

And bottom row ... 7 at x=-1, 8 at x=0, 9 at x=+1 ...

Wait, but in the problem's diagram, the first row is ...5 4 3 ..., which would be going leftwards... So if 3 is on the right, 4 is center, and 5 is left? Then perhaps in the top row (y=+1), we have numbers 5, 4, 3 at x=-1, 0, +1. Then in the middle row (y=0): 6, 1, 2. And in the bottom row (y=-1): 7, 8, 9. 

So coordinates for 3 is (1,1), 2 is (1,0), 1 is (0,0), 4 is (0,1), 5 is (-1,1), 6 is (-1,0), 7 is (-1,-1), 8 is (0,-1), 9 is (1,-1). So that seems to fit. 

Therefore, in this coordinate system, the spiral moves right along the top row, then down, left, left, down, left, up, etc. 

So when you finish the square, say at 9 (position (1,-1)), the next number would be moving up from there. So moving up from (1,-1) would be (1,-1 +1) = (1,0), but that's already filled with 2. Wait no, because the spiral is expanding. Wait maybe my diagram is not correct. 

Wait in the problem's example, after 9 is placed at the bottom right, the next numbers would go up. But according to the standard spiral, after 9, you go up to 10, then left to 11, 12, then down to 13, then right to 14, then right to 15, etc. But in that case, the coordinates would be expanding. 

But perhaps for the purpose of our problem, I need a way to figure out where the first number in a ring is located. Since 2026 is the first number in ring 23, which has side length 47. 

In general, each ring starts at the coordinate just to the right of the previous ring's starting position? No, when you complete a ring, the next number is added by moving in a direction. Wait, perhaps for each ring, the first number is located on the "east" side, moving towards the "north", but I need to think. 

Alternatively, since each ring has four sides. Each side has length equal to the ring number? Wait, no. Wait, for a ring with side length s=2k+1, the numbers between (previous ring end + 1) to (next ring end) can be divided into four sides, each of length 2k. 

For example, ring k=1, side length s=3. The numbers from 2 to 9. Each side has length 2*1=2? Wait 9-2+1=8 numbers. Split into four sides: 2-3 (right), 4-5 (down), 6-7 (left), 8-9 (up). Each side has 2 numbers. So yes, for ring k=1, each side has 2k numbers. Therefore, in general, for ring k, each side has 2k numbers. 

Therefore, the number of numbers per side is 2k. Therefore, for the starting number of the ring (which is (2(k-1)+1)^2 +1), if we can figure out where it is located, then we can find its coordinates. 

Since the ring starts at the first number, which is to the right of the end of the previous ring. Wait, let me think again. 

The previous ring ends at (2k-1)^2. Then the next ring (ring k) starts at (2k-1)^2 +1. Where is this number located? For example, in ring k=1, previous ring (ring 0) ends at 1, then next ring starts at 2, which is to the right of 1. In general, when you finish a ring, you are at the lower right corner, then you move right to start the next ring? No, let's think with ring k=1. 

After finishing the previous ring (ring 0) at position (0,0), you move right to (1,0) for 2, then up to (1,1) for 3, then left to (-1,1)... Wait no, for k=1, the first side is moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0). Then down to (2,-1), (2,-2). Then left to (1,-2), (0,-2). Then up to (-1,-2), (-2,-2). 

Wait in this case, the starting position for ring k is at (previous ring's end position) + direction. But when you finish a ring, you end at the lower left corner? For example, ring 0 ends at (0,0). Ring 1 ends at (-2,-2). Then the next ring would start at (-2,-2) + direction? 

Wait maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to find coordinates for the first number in each ring. 

Let me define that for ring k (starting from k=0), the first number is located at position (k, -k + 1) or something? Wait let me take examples. 

Ring 0: starts at 1, coordinates (0,0). 

Ring 1: starts at 2, coordinates (1,0). 

Ring 2: starts at 10. Where is 10? In the 5x5 grid. Let me reconstruct. 

After ring 1 (numbers 2-9), the last number is 9 at (-2,-2). Then the next number, 10, is to the left of 9? Wait no, when moving clockwise, after finishing ring 1 (which ends at 9), direction was up? Wait in ring 1, movement was right, up, left, down. 

So the first side (right): numbers 2, 3, 4. The second side (up): numbers 5, 6. The third side (left): numbers 7, 8. The fourth side (down): numbers 9. Wait no, each side for ring 1 has 2k numbers where k=1 (ring number), so 2*1=2 numbers per side. Wait numbers from 2 to 9 is 8 numbers. Divided into four sides with 2 numbers each. 

First side: moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is 2, then to (2,0) is 3. Then second side: moving up from (2,0) to (2,1) is 4, then to (2,2) is 5? Wait no, in the problem's diagram, at the top row ...5 4 3... So maybe my coordinate system is flipped. Maybe I need to think more carefully. 

Let me try to map the numbers step by step. 

Start at (0,0) = 1. 

Move right to (1,0) = 2, (2,0) = 3. 

Turn down (clockwise) to (2,-1) = 4, (2,-2) = 5. 

Turn left (clockwise) to (1,-2) = 6, (0,-2) = 7. 

Turn up (clockwise) to (-1,-2) = 8, (-2,-2) = 9. 

Then the next direction would be right again. From (-2,-2), moving right to (-2,-1) = 10, (-2, 0) = 11, etc. 

Therefore, the first number of ring 2 is 10, located at (-2,-1). 

Therefore, ring k=0: starts at (0,0). 

Ring k=1: starts at (1,0). 

Ring k=2: starts at (-2,-1). 

Ring k=3: where would it start? After finishing ring k=2 at number... Well, for ring k=2, numbers from 10 to 25. Let me think how the numbers go. 

After number 9 at (-2,-2), moving right along the bottom row: 

(-2,-1)=10, (-2,0)=11, (-2,1)=12, (-2,2)=13. 

Then up along the left side: 

(-1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (1,2)=16, (2,2)=17. 

Then left along the top side: 

(2,1)=18, (2,0)=19, (2,-1)=20, (2,-2)=21. 

Then down along the right side: 

(1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (-1,-2)=24, (-2,-2)=25. 

Wait, but 25 is supposed to be the end of ring 2 (since (2*2 +1)^2 = 5^2=25). So starting from 10 to 25 is 16 numbers. For ring k=2, each side has 2k=4 numbers. 4 sides, 16 numbers. 

Therefore, the first number of ring k=2 is 10 at (-2,-1). Then after finishing the ring at 25, the next number would be to the right of 25? But 25 is at (-2,-2). To move clockwise, the next direction would be right, so moving from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1)... but wait (-2,-1) is already 10. Wait that seems overlapping. 

Wait no, after finishing ring k=2 at 25 (-2,-2), to start ring k=3, you would move in the next direction. Since when finishing ring k=2, you were moving down along the right side to get to 25. The last move was from (-1,-2)=24 to (-2,-2)=25. The direction before was down. Then, to continue the spiral clockwise, the next direction is right. Therefore, moving right from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1)=10? But that's already filled. Wait clearly something is wrong here. 

Wait no, maybe my previous calculation is wrong. Let's recast the steps. 

Starting from 9 at (-2,-2). Move right to 10 (-2,-1), 11 (-2,0), 12 (-2,1), 13 (-2,2). Then up to 14 (-1,2), 15 (0,2), 16 (1,2), 17 (2,2). Then left to 18 (2,1), 19 (2,0), 20 (2,-1), 21 (2,-2). Then down to 22 (1,-2), 23 (0,-2), 24 (-1,-2), 25 (-2,-2). 

So after 25, the next number would be moving right from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1)... but that is already 10. So that can't be. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. The error is that each side should have 2k numbers for ring k. For ring k=2, 2k=4 numbers per side. However, when moving from 17 (2,2) left to (2, -2), that would be four numbers: (2,1)=18, (2,0)=19, (2,-1)=20, (2,-2)=21. Then down to (1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (-1,-2)=24, (-2,-2)=25. So four numbers. Therefore, after 25, we need to move in the next direction, which is right. But from (-2,-2), moving right would go to (-2,-1), but that's already occupied by 10. Hmm. This suggests that maybe after 25, you go in the opposite direction? Or maybe there is an error in how I'm calculating the coordinates. 

Wait, perhaps my direction is wrong. When you finish the last side of the ring, which was moving down from (1,-2)=22 to (0,-2)=23, then (-1,-2)=24, then (-2,-2)=25. The last move was down? No, when you are moving from (-1,-2) to (-2,-2), that's down? Wait if down is decreasing y-coordinate? Wait if earlier, moving from (2,0) to (2,-1) was down. Yes. So if up is increasing y, down is decreasing y. 

So after finishing the last side moving down to 25 at (-2,-2), the next direction is right? But can't move right because already filled. Therefore, perhaps in reality, when you complete the ring, you need to move in a direction opposite? Wait maybe my understanding is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the starting point of each ring is on the top side? 

Wait in ring k=0: center (0,0). 

Ring k=1: starts moving right from (0,0). 

Ring k=2: starts moving up from (-2, 2)? Wait no. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern to where the first number of each ring is located. 

Looking at ring k=0: (0,0). 

Ring k=1: first number is 2 at (1,0). 

Ring k=2: first number is 10 at (-2,-1). 

Wait that seems asymmetric. Maybe I need to find a general formula. 

Another approach: for a given ring number k, the numbers go from N_start = (2k-1)^2 + 1 to N_end = (2k+1)^2. The first number is located at a position that depends on the direction. 

Alternatively, since each ring is built by adding layers, perhaps there is a way to compute coordinates based on how far around the ring the number is. 

Since we know that 2026 is the first number of ring k=23, which is N_start = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1 = 2026. 

Therefore, since it's the first number in the ring, it's located at the beginning of the first side of the ring. The first side of each ring is moving to the right. 

But where is that first side located? 

Looking at the previous example with ring k=2: first number 10 is at position (-2,-1). How can we get that? 

For ring k, the first side is moving to the right, starting from a certain point. Let me think that in ring k, the first side is on the "east" side of the square? No. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can figure out that the first number of ring k is located at coordinates (k, -k + 1)? Let me test for k=1: (1, -1 +1)= (1,0). Correct, that's 2. For k=2, would it be (2, -2 +1)= (2,-1)? But in our example, for ring k=2, first number is at (-2,-1). So that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe depending on whether k is even or odd. 

Alternatively, think about the position relative to the center. Each ring has a side length of 2k + 1, so from the center, the distance along x or y is k. 

For example, for ring k=1, numbers are on x from -1 to +1 and y from -1 to +1, but extending. Wait no, the ring k=1 (s=3) goes up to coordinates like (2,2). 

Alternatively, when starting a new ring, the first number is located on the "east" side, one step up from the southernmost point of the previous ring. 

Wait for ring k=1, starting at 2, which is to the east of center. Then for ring k=2, starting at 10, which is to the north of the southernmost point of ring k=1. 

Alternatively, there is symmetry here. For each ring k, the first number is located at (k, -k + 1)? Wait let's try for k=1: (1, -1 +1)= (1, 0). Correct. For k=2, (2, -2 +1)= (2,-1). But in reality, the first number of ring k=2 is at (-2,-1). So if I take -(k), ? 

For k=2, first number at (-k, -(k-1))? So (-2, -1). Which matches our earlier example. Similarly for k=1, would that be (-1, -(1-1))= (-1, 0). But the first number of k=1 is at (1,0). So depending on the direction... So maybe for even and odd k? 

Alternatively, notice that when k is 1, first number is on the right side of the square; when k is 2, first number is on the bottom side. Wait, in coordinates for ring k=2, first number at (-2,-1). So if the ring is s=2k+1=5, the ring spans from x=-k-1 to x=k+1? No. Wait for ring k=2, which ends at 25, the coordinates go up to (2, 2). So the maximum x and y is k. 

Wait for ring number k, the coordinates range from -k to +k in x and y. 

So the first number of the ring is located on the eastern side? For k=1, yes. For k=2, it's on the southern side? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since the first number is on the first side of the ring, which always starts by moving to the right. But where is this side located? 

If we consider that when moving from one ring to another, after completing a ring by moving in some direction, the next ring starts by moving to the right. For example, after completing ring k=1 by moving down to 9 at (-2,-2), then the next direction is right, so moving from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1) is up? Wait no. Wait in ring k=1, the last move was moving down from (-1,-2) to (-2,-2). The direction was down (negative y). To continue clockwise, the next direction should be right (positive x). So from (-2,-2), moving right along positive x-axis. So the first number of ring k=2, which is 10, is at (-2,-2) moving right to (-2,-1). 

But according to our previous step-by-step, after 9 at (-2,-2), moving right gives us 10 at (-2,-1). So yes, first number of ring k=2 is at (-2,-1). Similarly, the first number of ring k=1 is at (1,0). 

So for ring k, the first number is located at a corner? Or at some offset. 

Let me try to find a general formula for the coordinates of the first number of ring k. 

When starting ring k, the first side is to the right. The starting position depends on the previous ring's end position. 

For ring k=1, starting position (1,0). 

For ring k=2, starting position (-2,-1). 

For ring k=3, following the same logic, after ring k=2 ends at (-2,-2). Moving right from there, along x-axis. So first side for ring k=3 would be moving from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2). Therefore, first number is 26 at (-2,-1)? Wait ring k=2 ends at 25. Then ring k=3 starts at 26. So yes, 26 at (-2,-1). 

Then the coordinates for the first number of ring k is:

For even k vs odd k? Wait for k=1 (odd), starting at (1,0). For k=2 (even), starting at (-2,-1). For k=3 (odd), starting at (-2,-1)? Wait no. Wait if k=3 is next, starting at 26. For ring k=3, side length is 7, starting at 26. Wait let me check. 

The last number of ring k=2 is 25. The next ring is k=3, which should end at (2*3 +1)^2=7^2=49. So numbers from 26 to 49. The first number is 26 at (-2,-1). Then moving right along x-axis to (-2, -1 + ...). So the first side has 2k=6 numbers? Wait ring k=3, 2k=6 numbers per side. 

Yes, from 26 to (26 + 6 -1)=31 on the first side. Then second side, up, numbers 32 to 37, third side left, 38 to 43, fourth side down, 44 to 49. 

Therefore, the starting position for ring k is dependent on the previous direction. 

However, there seems to be a pattern here. For ring k, the starting position is located at ( (-1)^{something} * k, something ). For example:

- Ring k=1 (odd): starts at ( +1, 0 )
- Ring k=2 (even): starts at ( -2, -1 )
- Ring k=3 (odd): starts at ( -2, -1 ) ?

Wait no, for ring k=3, the starting position is (-2, -1). Wait but k=3 is odd. Hmmm. 

Alternatively, notice that for ring k, the starting coordinates are:

If we think about the movement from the previous end. For ring k, after the previous ring ends at position P, then moving right gives the first number of ring k. 

The previous ring ends at position which is the southwest corner of the previous ring. For example, ring k=1 ends at (-2,-2). Then moving right gives the first number of ring k=2 at (-2,-1). 

Similarly, ring k=2 ends at (-2,-2). Wait no, ring k=2 ends at (-2,-2)? Wait earlier with numbers up to 25, yes. Then moving right gives the first number of ring k=3 at (-2,-1). 

Wait, so for any ring k, it ends at (-k, -k). Because for ring k=1: ends at (-2,-2)? Wait no. Wait ring k=1 has side length 3 (s=2*1 +1=3), and ends at (2*1 +1)^2=9. The end position for ring k=1 is (-2,-2). Similarly, ring k=2 ends at (-k', -k') where k'=?

Wait for ring k=1, the end position is (-k', -k') where k' = 2? 

Yes, since for ring number k=1, ending at position (-2,-2). If we denote that the end position of ring k is (- (k + 1), - (k + 1))? Wait for k=1, - (1 +1 ) = -2. So yes. For ring k, the end position is (- (k +1), - (k +1))? Wait let me check. 

For ring k=1: ends at (-2, -2). If k=1, then -(k+1)=-2. Correct. 

For ring k=2: ends at (-3,-3)? Wait no, earlier we had for ring k=2 ending at (-2,-2). Wait inconsistency here. 

Wait earlier, for ring k=2, the numbers go up to 25. The position of 25 was at (-2,-2). But if the formula is -(k+1), - (k+1), for k=2, would be -3,-3. But that's not the case. Therefore, my assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, the end position of ring k is (-k, -k). 

For k=1: ends at (-2,-2)? No. For k=1, ring k=1 ends at (-2,-2). If k=1, then -k is -1. Doesn't align. 

This is getting confusing. Maybe I need another approach. 

Since 2026 is the first number of ring k=23. Let's figure out its coordinates. 

As we saw in the earlier examples:

- The first number of ring k is located at the position obtained by moving one step to the right from the end of the previous ring. 

The end of the previous ring (ring k-1) is at some position. Where is that? 

For example, end of ring k-1 is at a corner. For ring k=1 (end at (-2,-2)), which is southwest corner. For ring k=2, the end is at (-2,-2)? No, for ring k=2, we ended at 25 which was at (-2,-2). So maybe for any ring k, ends at (- (k), - (k))? For k=1, ends at -2,-2? If k=1, then -k would be -1, no. 

Wait let me think recursively. Each ring is built by adding a layer around the previous square. The end of each ring is at the southwest corner. For example:

- Ring 0: just (0,0)
- Ring 1: ends at (-2,-2)
- Ring 2: ends at (-2,-2) ??? No, because ring 2 has side length 5, so it should extend further. Wait, no, for ring k=2, starting from 10 to 25. If we ended at (-2,-2), that would be same as ring 1. 

This is getting too confusing without a general formula. Maybe I need another way. 

Since we know that 2026 is the first number in ring k=23, and given that the first number of each ring is located on the "first side" of the ring, which is a side moving to the right. 

Each ring k has a side length of s = 2k + 1. Wait no, earlier we said that ring k has side length s = 2n + 1, but we also have ring number confusion. Earlier we saw that for the ring containing 2026, it's ring k=23 with side length 47 (since 2*23 + 1 = 47). Therefore, the ring number here is k=23. 

If I can find the coordinates of the first number of this ring (2026), then I can find its neighbors. 

To find the coordinates of 2026, which is the first number in the ring, we need to know where the ring starts. 

Let me think about the position of the first number in a ring. 

For ring k, when you finish the previous ring, you are at the southwest corner of the previous square. Then you move right to start the new ring. 

Let me define the southwest corner of the previous ring. For the previous ring, which is ring k-1, its side length is s_prev = 2(k-1) + 1 = 2k - 1. Therefore, the southwest corner would be at coordinates (- (s_prev -1)/2, - (s_prev -1)/2). Wait for example, for ring k=1, s_prev=3, southwest corner at (- (3-1)/2, - (3-1)/2) = (-1, -1). But we know that ring k=1 ends at (-2,-2). So that formula is not correct. 

Alternatively, since each ring expands outward, the southwest corner of ring k-1 would be at (- (k-1 + something), - ...). 

Alternatively, if the ring k has side length 2k +1, but this seems conflicting with previous definitions. 

Maybe I need to use a different notation. Let me let L be the ring layer. Let me define layer 0 as just the center, layer 1 as the first ring around it, etc. So layer L has side length 2L + 1. Therefore, layer L has numbers from N_start = (2L - 1)^2 + 1 to N_end = (2L + 1)^2. 

So for 2026, which is the first number of some layer L, we have N_start = (2L - 1)^2 + 1 = 2026. Since we found earlier that 2026 is just after 45^2 = 2025, so (2L -1)^2 = 2025 => 2L - 1 = 45 => 2L = 46 => L = 23. Therefore, layer L=23 has N_start = 2026. 

Therefore, layer L=23 has side length S=2*23 + 1=47. 

Now, we need to find the coordinates of N_start=2026. 

As mentioned, when moving to layer L, the first number is located by moving right from the end of the previous layer. The end of the previous layer (L=22) is at the southwest corner of that layer. 

What are the coordinates of the southwest corner of layer L=22? 

Layer L has side length 2L + 1. Wait layer L=22, side length S_prev = 2*22 + 1 = 45. Therefore, this layer extends from x = -22 to x = +22? No. Wait the side length is 45, so the coordinates go from - ( (45 -1)/2 ) to + ( (45 -1)/2 ). Since 45 = 2*22 + 1. Therefore, coordinates from -22 to +22 in both x and y. 

Therefore, the southwest corner of layer L=22 is at (-22, -22). 

Therefore, the first number of layer L=23 is located by moving one step to the right from (-22, -22). Wait no, moving right increases x-coordinate. So starting at (-22, -22), moving right would go to (-22, -21)? No, moving right along x-axis. Wait if you are facing down, then right would be... Wait no, the direction. 

Wait after finishing layer L=22, you were moving down to reach the southwest corner at (-22, -22). To continue the spiral, you turn right, which would be to the east (positive x-direction). So from (-22, -22), moving east (right) along the x-axis. Therefore, the first number of layer L=23 is at (-22, -22 + 1) = (-22, -21)? Or is it?

Wait if you are at (-22, -22) facing down (south), then turning right would face west? Wait no, if you're facing down (negative y-direction), turning right (clockwise) would face west? Wait standard directions: 

- If you move down (south), then a right turn is clockwise, which would be west? Wait no. 

If you are facing down (south), a right turn would be clockwise, which would turn you to the east? Wait no... 

Let me recall: the standard spiral goes clockwise. When moving down (south), the next direction after completing the side should be to the right, which would be clockwise. Facing south, turning right (clockwise) is to the west? No, facing south, right turn (clockwise) would be to the left? Wait, depends on your orientation. 

Imagine you are facing south. A right turn would mean turning towards the west? Or east? If you're facing south and make a right turn (clockwise), your right shoulder is to the... if you're facing south, right turn: your right side. If you imagine facing south, your right is west. Wait no, if you are facing south, your right is east? Wait no, facing north: right is east; facing south: right is west. 

Yes, because if you're facing south and turn right (clockwise), you're now facing west. 

Therefore, after moving down to reach the southwest corner, you turn right to face west and start moving? Wait no, that would mean moving west from (-22, -22). But in our previous small example with ring k=1, after reaching the southwest corner, you turned right (which would be west?) but instead moved right along the x-axis? 

Wait there is contradiction here. Let me go back to the small example. 

In the ring k=1, after finishing the previous ring (ring 0), you moved down to reach the southwest corner? No. Wait for ring k=1, starting at 2 (right of center), moving down to 4, 5, then left, then up. The last move was up to reach (-2,-2). Then turning right would be west? But the next number is to the right? 

This is getting too tangled. Maybe refer back to the coordinates we had for ring k=2. 

We saw that ring k=2 starts at (-2,-1). The previous ring (k=1) ended at (-2,-2). From there, moving right (assuming the direction was south, then turning right would be west? But moving west would be decreasing x. From (-2,-2), moving west would be to (-3,-2). But that's not what happened earlier. Earlier, we moved up from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1). 

Wait perhaps my understanding of the direction is wrong. Maybe after finishing a ring, you are facing a certain direction, and turning right proceeds accordingly. 

Let me try to track direction as we go through the spiral. 

Let's define direction as follows: 

- Right = east (increasing x)
- Up = north (increasing y)
- Left = west (decreasing x)
- Down = south (decreasing y)

Starting at the center (0,0) = 1, facing east.

Move right to 2 at (1,0). Still facing east. 

Move right to 3 at (2,0). Still facing east. 

Turn down (south), move down to 4 at (2,-1). 

Move down to 5 at (2,-2). Turn left (west), move left to 6 at (1,-2). 

Move left to 7 at (0,-2). Turn up (north), move up to 8 at (-1,-2). 

Move up to 9 at (-2,-2). Now, turn right (clockwise). Facing south, turning right would be west. But if you turn right from up (north)? Wait no, after moving up to 9, you were facing north. Then to continue the spiral, you turn right (clockwise), which would be east. Wait, the sequence is: right, down, left, up, right... 

After completing the four sides, the direction cycles. 

Wait maybe instead of trying to track direction, think about which side you are on. 

Each ring has four sides: 

1. Right side: moving east
2. Up side: moving north
3. Left side: moving west
4. Down side: moving south

And after completing the four sides, you proceed to the next ring. 

For ring k=1 (numbers 2-9), the first side (right) is from (0,0) to (2,0). Second side (up) from (2,0) to (2,2). Third side (left) from (2,2) to (-2,2). Fourth side (down) from (-2,2) to (-2,-2). 

Therefore, after finishing the fourth side (down) of ring k=1 at (-2,-2), the next ring (k=2) starts by moving east on the first side. But to move east from (-2,-2), we go to (-2,-2) moved east, which is (-2, -2) + east. Wait east is increasing x. So from (-2,-2), moving east would go to (-1,-2), (0,-2), etc? But earlier we said that first number of ring k=2 is at (-2,-1). Contradiction. 

Ah! Here's the mistake! If the fourth side of ring k=1 ends at (-2,-2), then the next side of ring k=2 should start moving north, not east! Because the four sides are right, up, left, down, and then to start the next ring, you need to continue the cycle. After finishing down side, next direction is right. 

Wait the sides are: 

1. Right (east)
2. Up (north)
3. Left (west)
4. Down (south)

Then, next direction is right again. 

Therefore, after finishing the down side of the ring, you turn right (clockwise) and move east. 

But facing south (after finishing down side), turning right is west? No, facing south, turning right is west? No, facing south, right turn is clockwise which is west? If you are facing south, your right is west? 

Wait let's use the standard: if you are facing north, right is east. Facing east, right is south. Facing south, right is west. Facing west, right is north. 

Therefore, after finishing the down side (south), you are facing south. Turning right would face west, and starting the next side moving west? But in our example, after finishing at (-2,-2) facing south, moving west would mean decreasing x further. However, earlier we saw that the first number of ring k=2 is at (-2,-1), which is north from (-2,-2). 

This suggests inconsistency. Where is the error? 

Let me go back step by step with ring k=1: 

Starting at 9 at (-2,-2), facing south (after finishing the down side). To start the next ring, we turn right, which would face west, and start moving west. But there is no space to move west from (-2,-2) since that would go to (-3,-2). But in our earlier example, the first number of ring k=2, which is 10, is at (-2,-1), which is north of (-2,-2). 

This suggests that the direction after down side should be north, not west! Therefore, my understanding of the direction is incorrect. 

Maybe the sides are ordered differently? Maybe after down side, you turn left instead of right? No, the spiral is clockwise. 

Wait let's think about the movement between rings. After completing the fourth side of ring k=1 (down side), the next number is 10 at (-2,-1). To get from 9 at (-2,-2) to 10 at (-2,-1), you move north. Therefore, after finishing the down side, the next direction is north. How does this fit with clockwise rotation? 

If you are moving south along the down side, to continue clockwise, the next direction should be east. But we moved north instead! This suggests there is a miscalculation in the direction. 

Wait no! The movement is clockwise around the square. After completing a side, you turn left to start the next side. Wait no, it's clockwise, so after completing a side, you turn right to continue. 

But here, after moving down along the fourth side, turning right should face west, but we need to move north. This suggests that maybe the turning direction is left instead of right? Let me verify with a simpler case. 

Take the transition from the first side to the second side: moving east, then turning right (clockwise) to face south? No, if you're moving east and turn right, you face south. But in our case, after moving east (first side), we turn up (north), not south. 

Wait no, looking at the small example: 

First side: moving right (east) to (2,0). Then second side: moving up (north) to (2,2). So from east, turning left (counterclockwise) would be north? Wait no, turning left from east is north, turning right is south. But the spiral is supposed to be clockwise. 

If the spiral is clockwise, then after moving east, you turn right to face south, but in our case we turned left to face north. This contradiction suggests that the spiral is counterclockwise, but the problem statement says it's clockwise. 

Wait the problem statement says: "the natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid... What is the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026?"

The example given in the problem is:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

From this, let's see the direction. Starting at 1, going clockwise would mean: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... Wait no. From 1, moving clockwise would be right to 2, then up to 4, then left to 3, then left to 5, then down to 6, then down to 7, then right to 8, then right to 9. Wait no, the numbers in the example are:

Top row: ... 5 4 3 ...

Middle row: ... 6 1 2 ...

Bottom row: ... 7 8 9 ...

So from 1, moving to 2 is east, then to 3 is east, but in the example, 2 is (1,0) and 3 is (2,0). Then moving to 4 would be up to (2,1), then to 5 is up to (2,2), then to 6 is left to (1,2)? No, the middle row is ... 6 1 2 ..., so 6 is to the left of 1. 

Wait if 1 is at (0,0), then 6 is at (-1,0). How does that happen? Let me try to trace the numbers:

Start at 1 at (0,0).

Move east to 2 at (1,0).

Move east to 3 at (2,0).

Move north to 4 at (2,1).

Move north to 5 at (2,2).

Move west to 6 at (1,2).

Move west to 4 at (0,2)? Wait but 4 is already at (2,1). This is confusing. 

Wait the example provided is truncated, but let's assume the standard clockwise spiral. The standard Ulam spiral starts at 1, moves right, up, left, left, down, down, right, right, right, up, etc. Each time adding a layer. 

In any case, it seems my previous attempts to calculate coordinates are error-prone. Perhaps there's a better way. 

Given that 2026 is the first number in layer L=23, and given that layer L starts at (2L-1)^2 + 1 = 2026, and has side length S=2L+1=47. 

The first number of the layer is located one step away from the previous layer's end. Assuming that the previous layer's end is at coordinates (-L_prev, -L_prev) where L_prev = L -1 = 22. So coordinates (-22, -22). Then, to start the next layer, moving in the direction that would be the first side. If moving from (-22, -22) to start the new layer, which direction is that? If the previous movement was south (down) to reach (-22,-22), then the next movement should be east (right), but as we saw earlier, this seems conflicting with the small example. 

But in the small example, when we moved from 9 at (-2,-2), we moved north to 10 at (-2,-1). This suggests that after finishing the down side, the next direction is north, which would mean turning left instead of right. This would imply the spiral is counterclockwise, but the problem says it's clockwise. 

Given this confusion, maybe I should look up the standard coordinates for a spiral or find a formula. 

After some research in my mind, I recall that the position of a number in the spiral can be determined by finding which layer it's in, determining its position along that layer's perimeter, and then calculating its coordinates based on that. 

Since 2026 is the first number in layer L=23, let's focus on that layer. 

For layer L, the numbers go from N_start = (2L-1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026 to N_end = (2L +1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209. 

Each layer has four sides, each with length 2L. Therefore, the first side has numbers from N_start to N_start + 2L - 1. 

Since 2026 is the first number, it is at the start of the first side. 

Now, to find the coordinates, we need to know where the first side of layer L starts. 

From the small example, layer L=1 starts at 2, which is to the east of the center. For layer L=2, it starts at (-2,-1), which is to the north of the southwest corner of the previous layer. 

Assuming that for layer L, the starting position is at ( - (L -1), -L ). Let's check for L=1: ( -0, -1 ) = (0, -1). No, because layer L=1 starts at (1,0). Hmm. 

Alternatively, for layer L, the starting position is at (L, 1 - L). For L=1: (1, 0). Correct. For L=2: (2, -1). Which matches our earlier example where layer L=2 starts at (-2,-1)? No, (2,-1) is not (-2,-1). 

Wait maybe it's (L, 1 - L) for odd layers and something else for even? Or absolute values? 

Alternatively, if each layer starts on the eastern side, but alternates direction? No. 

Alternatively, from the previous layer's southwest corner at (-L_prev, -L_prev), moving east to start the new layer, the starting position would be (-L_prev, -L_prev + 1). Since L_prev = L - 1, for layer L, starting position is (- (L -1), - (L -1) + 1) = (-L + 1, -L + 2). 

For L=1: -1 +1 = 0, -1 + 2 = 1. (0, 1)? But the starting position for L=1 is (1,0). Doesn't match. 

This is too confusing. Let's try to think differently. 

For any number in layer L, the distance from the center is L. So the maximum coordinate in any direction is L. 

Since 2026 is the first number in layer L=23, it is located on the first side of the layer, which is the eastern side. Wait, for layer L, if the first side is eastern, then it would be at (center + L in x-direction, ...). Wait if the center is (0,0), then moving east L=23 would be at (23, 0). But that conflicts with the small example, where for L=1, the first number is at (1,0), which is indeed (L, 0). But in our earlier small example with L=2, the first number was at (-2,-1), not (2,0). So this suggests inconsistency. 

Wait perhaps the first side alternates between north and east? 

Alternatively, let's use the fact that the first number in layer L is at position (L, 1 - L). Wait for L=1: (1, 0), correct. For L=2: (2, -1). Let's check if that makes sense. If layer L=2 starts at (2, -1), then moving east along the first side, that would be increasing x? No, if you're moving east, you increase x, but if you start at (2, -1), moving east would go to (3, -1), which is outside the layer's bounds. Wait no, layer L=2 has side length 5, so coordinates from -2 to +2 in x and y. So (2, -1) is on the eastern side. Moving east from there would go beyond, so actually the first side should be moving north from (2, -1) ? No, the first side should be moving east, but since you can't go beyond, perhaps the first side is moving north? 

This is really tangled. Maybe refer to the formula for the coordinates of a number in the spiral. 

I recall that for a number n, the layer it is in is determined by the floor of the square root. If n is a perfect square, it's on the northeast corner of its layer. Otherwise, it's on one of the four sides. 

Given that, since 2026 is the first number of layer 23, it is one more than 45² = 2025. So it is at the starting point of the layer, which should be just to the east of the previous layer's last number. 

The previous layer's last number, 2025, is at the southwest corner of layer 22, which is at coordinates (-22, -22). Moving east from there, the next number, 2026, should be at (-22, -22 + 1) = (-22, -21). Wait, but moving east would mean increasing x, not y. If you are at (-22, -22), moving east is to (-21, -22). Ah! Yes! My mistake earlier was in which axis to increment. 

Let me clarify: moving east increases x-coordinate, moving north increases y-coordinate. 

So, if you are at (-22, -22), and you start moving east, you move to (-21, -22), then to (-20, -22), etc. 

Therefore, the first number of layer L=23 is at (-22, -22), moving east one step to (-21, -22). Wait but 2026 is the first number of the layer, so it should be at (-22, -22) moved east one step? Or is it at (-22, -22)? 

Wait the last number of the previous layer is at (-22, -22). To start the next layer, you move east from there, right? So the first number of the new layer, 2026, is at (-22 + 1, -22) = (-21, -22). 

Wait let's test with our small example. For layer L=1, previous layer's end is at (-1, -1) (assuming L_prev=0 with side length 1). Moving east from there would be to (-0, -1) = (0, -1). But in reality, the first number of layer L=1 is at (1,0). Conflict. 

Wait this suggests inconsistency. Let's go back. 

For layer L, the side length is 2L + 1. Wait no, earlier we defined L such that N_start = (2L -1)^2 + 1. For L=23, N_start=45² +1. So 2L -1 = 45 => L=23. So the previous layer is L_prev = L - 1 = 22, with side length 2*22 + 1 = 45. 

The southwest corner of layer L_prev is at (-L_prev, -L_prev) = (-22, -22). To start layer L=23, you need to move east from that point, so the first number of layer L=23 is at (-22 + 1, -22) = (-21, -22). 

But let's check for L=1. Previous layer is L_prev=0, side length 1, southwest corner at (0,0). Moving east gives (1, 0), which is the first number of layer L=1, which is correct (number 2). Yes! 

For L=2, previous layer L_prev=1, southwest corner at (-1, -1)? No, earlier we thought for L=1 the southwest corner was at (-2, -2). Wait no, this depends on how we define it. 

Wait for L_prev=1, the side length is 2*1 + 1=3, so it goes from -1 to +1 in x and y. Therefore, the southwest corner is at (-1, -1). Moving east from there would be (0, -1), which would be the starting position for layer L=2. But in our earlier example, we saw that the first number of layer L=2 is at (-2, -1). Contradiction. 

Ah, here is the problem! For L_prev=1, the southwest corner is at (-1, -1)? No, the side length is 3, so it goes from x=-1 to +1, y=-1 to +1. But the southwest corner is at (-1, -1). But in our small example, for L=1 (side length 3), the last number was at (-2, -2). This suggests that my previous understanding of the southwest corner is wrong. 

Actually, the southwest corner of layer L_prev should be at (-L_prev, -L_prev). For L_prev=1, it should be (-1, -1). But earlier, when we manually traced for L=1, we ended at (-2, -2). This inconsistency indicates a miscalculation earlier. 

Let me redo the small example carefully. 

Let's take layer L=1, which has side length 3 (numbers 2-9). Let's trace the coordinates:

Start at (0,0) = 1. 

Move east to (1,0)=2, (2,0)=3. 

Turn south, move to (2,-1)=4, (2,-2)=5. 

Turn west, move to (1,-2)=6, (0,-2)=7. 

Turn north, move to (-1,-2)=8, (-2,-2)=9. 

So the last number, 9, is at (-2, -2). But according to the earlier formula, the southwest corner should be at (-L_prev, -L_prev) = (-1, -1). Clearly, there's a mistake here. 

The issue is in how L_prev is defined. For layer L=1, the side length is 3, which corresponds to extending from -1 to +1 in x and y? No, because in reality, the coordinates go up to ±2. 

The correct relationship is that for a layer with side length s, the coordinates range from -(s-1)/2 to +(s-1)/2. For s=3, it's from -1 to +1. But in our tracing, the coordinates went to -2, +2. Wait no, in the above example, we went to (2,0), (2,-2), (-2,-2). This suggests that the side length is 3, but the coordinates go from -2 to +2? That can't be. 

Actually, the side length is the number of cells on each side. For example, a 3x3 grid has side length 3, extending from -1 to +1 in both directions, but when you traverse it, you move from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0), which is out of the -1 to +1 range. This indicates that the side length is actually the number of steps, not the number of cells. 

This is getting too confusing without a clear formula. I need to find a reliable way to determine the coordinates of 2026. 

Since 2026 is the first number of layer L=23, and we've determined that the previous layer's last number is at (-22, -22), and moving east from there gives the first number of the new layer, which is at (-22 + 1, -22) = (-21, -22). 

Let's verify this with our small example. For layer L=1, previous layer's last number is at (-1, -1), moving east gives (0, -1). But in our manual tracing, the first number of layer L=1 is at (1,0). This suggests inconsistency. 

Wait, perhaps the previous layer's last number is not at (-L_prev, -L_prev). In our manual tracing for layer L=1, the last number is at (-2, -2). If L_prev=1, then -L_prev = -1, but we ended at -2, -2. This suggests that the previous layer's last number is at (-L, -L), where L is the layer number. For layer L=1, L=1, so (-1, -1)? No, in reality it was (-2, -2). 

Wait maybe the previous layer's last number is at -(L + 1), -(L + 1). For L=1, -2, -2. For L=2, -3, -3. If that's the case, then for layer L=23, the previous layer's last number is at -24, -24. Moving east from there gives (-23, -24) as the first number of layer L=23. 

But how does this align with layer L=1? Let me see. If for layer L=1, previous layer (L=0) has last number at (0,0). Then moving east gives (1,0), which is correct. But according to this new idea, for L=1, previous layer's last number is at -(L + 1), -(L + 1) = -2, -2. Which conflicts with L=0. 

This suggests that there is no consistent formula without a clearer understanding. Perhaps I need to use the number of steps from the center. 

Since 2026 is the first number of layer 23, it is at distance L=23 from the center? No, the distance from the center for numbers in layer L is L. Wait for layer L, the maximum distance from the center is L. 

Since 2026 is the first number of the layer, it is on the first side, which is the eastern side, and is one step away from the southwest corner of the previous layer. 

Given the previous layer's last number is at (- (L_prev + 1), - (L_prev + 1)) = -(22 + 1) = -23, so (-23, -23). Moving east from there gives (-23 + 1, -23) = (-22, -23). 

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to find a resource or formula. 

I recall that in a square spiral, the four corners of each layer can be calculated. For layer n (where n=0 is the center), the four corners are:

Top-right: (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 1 = (n+1)^2 - n

Wait let me recall: the numbers on the corners of each layer. For example, layer 1 (around the center) has four corners: 3, 5, 7, 9. Layer 2 has corners 13, 17, 21, 25, etc. The formula for the corners is (2n+1)^2 - 3n, (2n+1)^2 - 2n, (2n+1)^2 - n, and (2n+1)^2. 

But since 2026 is the first number of layer 23, which is one more than (2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025, it is at the first position of the layer, just after the southwest corner of the previous layer. 

Assuming that the southwest corner of layer 22 is at ( - (22 + 1), - (22 + 1) ) = (-23, -23). Then moving east from there, the first number of layer 23, 2026, is at (-23 + 1, -23) = (-22, -23). 

But let's verify with layer 1: previous layer (layer 0) has southwest corner at (0,0). Moving east
