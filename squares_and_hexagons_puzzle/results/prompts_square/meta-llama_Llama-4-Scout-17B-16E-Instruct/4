## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To solve this, we first need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are arranged.

## 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
We need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral to determine its neighbors. The spiral starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we can calculate the sum of the first n odd numbers, which represents the total numbers in the first n layers of the spiral. The sum of the first n odd numbers is $n^2$. We need to find the smallest n such that $n^2 \geq 2026$.

## 4: Calculate the layer of 2026
Solving $n^2 \geq 2026$, we get $n \geq \sqrt{2026}$. Calculating, $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$. This means 2026 is in the 45th layer or less, but since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 must be in the 45th layer.

## 5: Find the position of 2026 in its layer
Since $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 is the first number in the 45th layer. The numbers in each layer are arranged in a square with side length $2n - 1$ for the nth layer, but since we're looking at layers starting from 1 and increasing, for the 45th layer, the side length is $2*45 - 1 = 89$.

## 6: Determine the coordinates of 2026
2026 is at the corner of the 45th layer. If we consider the center of the spiral as (0,0), and assuming the first layer starts at (1,1) and moves outward, we need to adjust our understanding. The 45th layer's corner coordinates can be determined by the pattern. The first number of each layer starts at $(n-1)*2 + 1$ from the center in both the x and y directions for an odd n, but since 2026 is at a corner, its coordinates can be derived from the layer's dimensions.

## 7: Calculate the coordinates of 2026
The center of the spiral is at (0,0). The side length of the square that 2026 is on is 89. Since 2026 is at the top-right corner of its layer, and assuming the bottom-left corner of the layer is at $(-44*2 + 1, -44*2 + 1)$ or similar, we adjust to find 2026's exact position. However, given that 2026 is the first number in its layer and layers increase clockwise, we focus on its neighbors.

## 8: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally from 2026. Given the spiral pattern, the immediate neighbors will be at positions that are one step away in the grid.

## 9: Calculate the neighbors
2026 is at a corner of its layer. Its neighbors will include:
- The number below it (2025),
- The number to its left (2025 - 89 = 1936),
- The number above it (2027),
- The number to its right (2027),
- And the four diagonal neighbors.

However, given the structure, we realize that to find the sum of all 8 neighbors directly:
- Directly above: 2027
- Directly below: 2025
- Directly left: 1936
- Directly right: 2116 (since 2026 + 90 = 2116, moving right in the spiral)
- Diagonally up-left: 1935
- Diagonally up-right: 2117
- Diagonally down-left: 1937
- Diagonally down-right: 2118

## 10: Sum the neighbors
Sum = 2027 + 2025 + 1936 + 2116 + 1935 + 2117 + 1937 + 2118

## 11: Perform the sum
Sum = 2027 + 2025 = 4052
Sum = 4052 + 1936 = 5988
Sum = 5988 + 2116 = 8104
Sum = 8104 + 1935 = 10039
Sum = 10039 + 2117 = 12156
Sum = 12156 + 1937 = 14093
Sum = 14093 + 2118 = 16211

The final answer is: $\boxed{16211}$
