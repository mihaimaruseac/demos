## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of the spiral. The spiral starts from the outside and moves inwards. The numbers increase consecutively as we move along the spiral.

## 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the spiral. We note that the spiral can be divided into layers or squares, with each layer having a side length that increases by 2 compared to the previous layer (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc.).

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
Let's calculate the layer in which 2026 is located. The total number of cells in the first $n$ layers of the spiral can be represented as $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n + 1)^2$. We need to find $n$ such that $(2n + 1)^2$ is just below or around 2026.

## 4: Calculate the layer
Solving $(2n + 1)^2 \approx 2026$, we get $2n + 1 \approx \sqrt{2026}$. Therefore, $2n + 1 \approx 45$, which gives $n \approx 22$. This means 2026 is likely in the 22nd layer (or the 44th and 45th rows/columns, considering the center as layer 0).

## 5: Find the exact position of 2026
Since $(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$, 2026 must be in the next layer out. The number 2026 is the first number in its layer (which starts at 2026), meaning it's on the top edge of its layer.

## 6: Determine the coordinates of 2026
The center of the spiral is at (0,0). The layers are numbered starting from 0. The 22nd layer has a side length of $2*22 + 1 = 45$. Since 2026 is the first number in its layer and layers increase by 1 in radius, we consider the coordinates relative to the center of the spiral. The layer that 2026 is on has a radius of 22 (from the center), and 2026 is at the top of this layer.

## 7: Calculate the coordinates
Given that 2025 numbers fit into a 45x45 square, and 2026 is the first number in the next layer, its coordinates can be considered as (22, -22) if we were counting from the center in a Cartesian plane, but we need to adjust based on the actual spiral pattern and its orientation.

## 8: Identify neighbors
The 8 neighbors of a point $(x, y)$ are $(x+1, y)$, $(x-1, y)$, $(x, y+1)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x+1, y+1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, and $(x-1, y-1)$. For 2026 at $(22, -22)$, we adjust our understanding to the spiral's grid.

## 9: Adjust for spiral grid and find neighbors
Considering the spiral pattern and that 2026 is at the start of a new layer, its actual position needs to be translated into the grid coordinates. If we visualize the spiral, 2026 would be at $(23, -22)$ or similar, depending on how we align the grid. The neighbors would then be at $(24, -22)$, $(22, -22)$, $(23, -21)$, $(23, -23)$, $(24, -21)$, $(24, -23)$, $(22, -21)$, and $(22, -23)$.

## 10: Convert neighbors to numbers
To find the numbers corresponding to these positions, we must understand the spiral's numbering pattern. The number at position $(x, y)$ can be calculated based on the layer and direction. However, given 2026's position, we can infer its neighbors' values by adding/subtracting 1 from the layer's starting number and adjusting for the direction.

## 11: Calculate the sum of neighbors
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2073, 1973, 2074, 1974, 2075, and 1975. Summing these: $2025 + 2027 + 2073 + 1973 + 2074 + 1974 + 2075 + 1975$.

## 12: Perform the sum
$2025 + 2027 = 4052$, $4052 + 2073 = 6125$, $6125 + 1973 = 8098$, $8098 + 2074 = 10172$, $10172 + 1974 = 12146$, $12146 + 2075 = 14221$, $14221 + 1975 = 16196$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16196}$
