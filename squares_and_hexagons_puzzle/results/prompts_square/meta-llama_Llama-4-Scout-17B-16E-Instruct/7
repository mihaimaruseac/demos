## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to understand the pattern of the spiral and locate 2026.

## 2: Locate the position of 2026 in the spiral
To locate 2026, we should first determine in which layer of the spiral it falls. The layers of the spiral can be thought of as concentric squares. The first layer (1) has 1 number, the second layer (2-9) has 8 numbers, the third layer (10-25) has 16 numbers, and so on. Each layer $n$ has $8n$ numbers.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
Let's calculate the cumulative number of elements up to each layer to find where 2026 falls:
- Layer 1: $1 = 1$
- Layer 2: $1 + 8 = 9$
- Layer 3: $9 + 16 = 25$
- Layer 4: $25 + 24 = 49$
- Layer 5: $49 + 32 = 81$
- Layer 6: $81 + 40 = 121$
- Layer 7: $121 + 48 = 169$
- Layer 8: $169 + 56 = 225$
- Layer 9: $225 + 64 = 289$
- Layer 10: $289 + 72 = 361$
- Layer 11: $361 + 80 = 441$
- Layer 12: $441 + 88 = 529$
- Layer 13: $529 + 96 = 625$
- Layer 14: $625 + 104 = 729$
- Layer 15: $729 + 112 = 841$
- Layer 16: $841 + 120 = 961$
- Layer 17: $961 + 128 = 1089$
- Layer 18: $1089 + 136 = 1225$
- Layer 19: $1225 + 144 = 1369$
- Layer 20: $1369 + 152 = 1521$
- Layer 21: $1521 + 160 = 1681$
- Layer 22: $1681 + 168 = 1849$
- Layer 23: $1849 + 176 = 2025$

## 4: Identify the layer and position of 2026
2026 is in the 23rd layer. Since the 23rd layer starts at 2025, 2026 is the second number in this layer.

## 5: Understand the structure of a layer
Each layer is a square with a side length that increases by 1 for each subsequent layer. The 23rd layer has a side length of $4 * 6 - 1 = 23$ (considering the first layer as having a side length of 1, but for calculations, we consider the increment pattern). However, given that we are looking at layers and their numbers, we should directly consider the positioning.

## 6: Calculate the coordinates of 2026
The first number of the 23rd layer is 2025. Given that 2026 is the second number, and assuming the spiral moves clockwise, we can deduce its position. The layer starts from the bottom right and moves counter-clockwise. If 2025 is at the bottom right, 2026 would be at the bottom second from the right.

## 7: Determine the coordinates of 2026
To simplify, let's assume the bottom right corner of the grid where 2025 is located is (0,0) if we were to superimpose a coordinate system with the origin at this point for simplicity. The side length of the 23rd layer's square is $\sqrt{2025} = 45$ (but this approach is not directly necessary as we focus on relative positions). However, we know 2025 is at the corner, and moving to 2026, we go left.

## 8: Find the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 in the spiral grid would be:
- Above: ?
- Below: ?
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Top-left: ?
- Top-right: ?
- Bottom-left: ?
- Bottom-right: ?

## 9: Calculate the specific neighbors
Given the structure, if 2026 is second from the right on the bottom, its neighbors are:
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Above: 2025 + 45 = 2070 (since moving up one row would increase the number by the side length of the layer, but we adjust based on actual layer and position)
- Below: Not directly calculable without layer specifics, but we know it's in a square pattern.
- The layer's side length can help determine exact positions.

## 10: Precise calculation for neighbors
The 23rd layer has 176 numbers (as $8*22 = 176$), and it starts at 2025. The numbers increase as we move counter-clockwise. The side length of this layer is 44 (as it's an odd number layer, but considering it as part of a sequence where each layer increases).

## 11: Identify exact neighbors
2026's neighbors are directly adjacent numbers:
- Above: 2026 - 44 = 1982
- Below: 2026 + 44 = 2070
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Top-left: 1981
- Top-right: 1983
- Bottom-left: 2071
- Bottom-right: 2072 (considering a direct grid movement)

## 12: Calculate the sum of neighbors
Sum = 1982 + 1983 + 1981 + 2070 + 2071 + 2072 + 2025 + 2027

## 13: Perform the calculation
Sum = 1982 + 1983 + 1981 = 5946
Sum = 2070 + 2071 + 2072 = 6213
Sum = 5946 + 6213 = 12159
Sum = 12159 + 2025 = 14184
Sum = 14184 + 2027 = 16211

The final answer is: $\boxed{16211}$
