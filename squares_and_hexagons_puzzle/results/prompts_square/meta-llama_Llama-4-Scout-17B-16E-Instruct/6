## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To solve this, we first need to understand the pattern of how the numbers are arranged in the spiral.

## 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
We need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral to determine its neighbors. The spiral starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we note that each layer (or square) in the spiral has a side length that increases by 2 compared to the previous layer (the first layer has a side length of 1, the second layer has a side length of 3, and so on). The number of elements in each layer forms a sequence of odd squares: 1, 9, 25, 49, ...

## 4: Calculate the layer of 2026
Let's calculate which layer 2026 falls into. The total number of elements up to and including the nth layer can be represented as $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n + 1)^2$. We need to find n such that $(2n + 1)^2$ is just below or around 2026.

## 5: Solve for n
Solving $(2n + 1)^2 \approx 2026$, we get $2n + 1 \approx \sqrt{2026}$. Therefore, $2n + 1 \approx 45$, which gives $2n \approx 44$ and $n \approx 22$. This means 2026 is likely in the 22nd layer (considering the first layer as layer 1).

## 6: Verify the layer and find the position of 2026
The 22nd layer has $(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ elements. This means 2026 is the first element in the 23rd layer.

## 7: Determine the coordinates of 2026
Since 2026 is the first element in the 23rd layer, and considering the spiral pattern, we can determine its coordinates. The center of the spiral is (0,0), and each layer adds 1 to the radius. The 22nd layer ends at $(22, 22)$ if we consider the distance from the center. The 23rd layer starts at $(-22, -22)$ and moves clockwise. However, to simplify, we consider the grid position relative to the bottom-left corner of the layer it's in.

## 8: Find the neighbors of 2026
Given that 2026 is at the start of a new layer, its neighbors will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally. In a spiral pattern on a grid, if 2026 is at position $(x, y)$, its neighbors are at $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x, y+1)$, $(x-1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, and $(x+1, y+1)$.

## 9: Calculate the coordinates of 2026 in the grid
The first number in each layer is at the bottom-left corner of that layer. For the 23rd layer, which starts with 2026, we consider its position relative to the origin. The side length of the 23rd layer is $2*23 - 1 = 45$. The bottom-left corner of the 23rd layer can be considered as $(-22, -22)$ if we were counting from the center, but since we're looking at grid positions and 2026 is the first number, we consider it as $(1, 1)$ in its local grid.

## 10: Identify the actual coordinates for 2026
2026 is at $(1, 1)$ in its layer. To find its neighbors, we look at the numbers around it: $(0, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 2)$, $(0, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, $(2, 0)$, and $(2, 2)$.

## 11: Convert neighbor positions to actual numbers
We need to convert these positions into actual numbers in the sequence. The layer starts with 2026 at $(1,1)$, so:
- $(0,1)$ is 2025,
- $(2,1)$ is 2027,
- $(1,0)$ is 2024 (one row up),
- $(1,2)$ is 2028 (one row down),
- $(0,0)$ is 2024 - 45 = 1979 (since moving left decreases the number by the layer size),
- $(0,2)$ is 2028 - 45 = 1983,
- $(2,0)$ is 2024 + 45 = 2069,
- $(2,2)$ is 2028 + 45 = 2073.

## 12: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
The sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 1979 + 1983 + 2069 + 2073$.

## 13: Perform the calculation
Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 1979 + 1983 + 2069 + 2073$.
Sum = $2025 + 2027 = 4052$,
Sum = $4052 + 2024 = 6076$,
Sum = $6076 + 2028 = 8104$,
Sum = $8104 + 1979 = 10083$,
Sum = $10083 + 1983 = 12066$,
Sum = $12066 + 2069 = 14135$,
Sum = $14135 + 2073 = 16208$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16208}$
