## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To solve this, we first need to understand the pattern of how the numbers are arranged. The spiral starts from the top right, moves left, then down, then right, and then up, increasing the radius as it goes.

## 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral. The spiral can be divided into layers or squares, with each layer having a side length that increases by 2 (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc.). We need to determine in which layer 2026 is located.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
Let's calculate the number of elements in each layer until we reach or exceed 2026.
- The 1st layer (1x1) has 1 element.
- The 2nd layer (3x3) has 8 elements, total = 1 + 8 = 9.
- The 3rd layer (5x5) has 16 elements, total = 9 + 16 = 25.
- The 4th layer (7x7) has 24 elements, total = 25 + 24 = 49.
- The 5th layer (9x9) has 32 elements, total = 49 + 32 = 81.
- The 6th layer (11x11) has 40 elements, total = 81 + 40 = 121.
- The 7th layer (13x13) has 48 elements, total = 121 + 48 = 169.
- The 8th layer (15x15) has 56 elements, total = 169 + 56 = 225.
- The 9th layer (17x17) has 64 elements, total = 225 + 64 = 289.
- The 10th layer (19x19) has 72 elements, total = 289 + 72 = 361.
- The 11th layer (21x21) has 80 elements, total = 361 + 80 = 441.
- The 12th layer (23x23) has 88 elements, total = 441 + 88 = 529.
- The 13th layer (25x25) has 96 elements, total = 529 + 96 = 625.
- The 14th layer (27x27) has 104 elements, total = 625 + 104 = 729.
- The 15th layer (29x29) has 112 elements, total = 729 + 112 = 841.
- The 16th layer (31x31) has 120 elements, total = 841 + 120 = 961.
- The 17th layer (33x33) has 128 elements, total = 961 + 128 = 1089.
- The 18th layer (35x35) has 136 elements, total = 1089 + 136 = 1225.
- The 19th layer (37x37) has 144 elements, total = 1225 + 144 = 1369.
- The 20th layer (39x39) has 152 elements, total = 1369 + 152 = 1521.
- The 21st layer (41x41) has 160 elements, total = 1521 + 160 = 1681.
- The 22nd layer (43x43) has 168 elements, total = 1681 + 168 = 1849.
- The 23rd layer (45x45) has 176 elements, total = 1849 + 176 = 2025.
- The 24th layer (47x47) starts at 2026.

## 4: Locate 2026 in the 24th layer
2026 is in the 24th layer. The 24th layer is a 47x47 grid, and it starts at 2026. We need to find the position of 2026 in this layer.

## 5: Calculate the position of 2026
Since 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer, and considering the spiral pattern, we can deduce that 2026 is at the top right corner of the 47x47 grid.

## 6: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally adjacent to it. Given the spiral pattern and that 2026 is at the corner, we need to consider the actual layout:
- Above: 2025
- Below: 2027
- Left: Not directly available since 2026 is at the right edge
- Right: Not directly available since 2026 is at the right edge
- Diagonals: Not directly available for all since 2026 is at the corner

## 7: Determine the exact neighbors
Considering the spiral layout and that 2026 is at the top right of a 47x47 grid:
- The number to the left of 2026 is 2025.
- The number above 2026 is 1973 (since we move up one layer in the spiral).
- The number to the right of 2026 is 2027.
- The number below 2026 is 2075 (since we move down one layer in the spiral).
- The diagonals and other neighbors need to be calculated based on the spiral pattern.

## 8: Calculate all neighbors
To find all 8 neighbors, we must understand the pattern:
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Above: 1973
- Below: 2075
- Top-left: 1922 (moving up and left in the spiral)
- Top-right: Not applicable as 2026 is at the right edge
- Bottom-left: 2024 (moving down and left)
- Bottom-right: 2028 (moving down and right)

## 9: Correctly identify all neighbors
Given the spiral and the position of 2026:
- The correct neighbors are:
- Above: 1973
- Below: 2075
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Top-left: 1922
- Top-right: 1974
- Bottom-left: 2024
- Bottom-right: 2028

## 10: Sum the neighbors
Sum = 1973 + 2075 + 2025 + 2027 + 1922 + 1974 + 2024 + 2028

## 11: Perform the sum
Sum = 1973 + 2075 = 4048
Sum = 4048 + 2025 = 6073
Sum = 6073 + 2027 = 8100
Sum = 8100 + 1922 = 10022
Sum = 10022 + 1974 = 11996
Sum = 11996 + 2024 = 14020
Sum = 14020 + 2028 = 16048

The final answer is: $\boxed{16048}$
