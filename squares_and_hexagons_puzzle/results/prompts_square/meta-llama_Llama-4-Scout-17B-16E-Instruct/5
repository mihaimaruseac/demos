## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to understand the pattern of the spiral and locate 2026.

## 2: Identify the layers of the spiral
The spiral can be thought of as layers of squares, where each layer adds a square to each side of the previous layer. The first layer is a single number (1), the second layer adds 4 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, but 1 is already there, so it adds 4 new numbers), the third layer adds 8 numbers, and so on. Each layer $n$ adds $4(n-1)$ new numbers.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
To find which layer 2026 is on, we calculate the cumulative number of cells up to each layer until we exceed 2026. The total number of cells up to and including layer $n$ is $1 + 4(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 4 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 2n^2 - 2n + 1$.

## 4: Solve for the layer of 2026
We need to solve $2n^2 - 2n + 1 \geq 2026$ for $n$. This simplifies to $2n^2 - 2n - 2025 \geq 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $n = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2025)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16200}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16204}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm 127.2}{4}$. Considering positive $n$, $n \approx \frac{2 + 127.2}{4} = 32.3$. Since $n$ must be an integer and we're looking for the layer that includes 2026, we test $n = 32$.

## 5: Calculate the number of cells up to layer 32
For $n = 32$, the total number of cells is $2 \cdot 32^2 - 2 \cdot 32 + 1 = 2048 - 64 + 1 = 1985$. This means 2026 is on layer 33.

## 6: Find the position of 2026 on layer 33
Since layer 32 has 1985 cells, and 2026 is the $2026 - 1985 = 41$st number on layer 33, we need to find its position on the grid.

## 7: Determine the coordinates of 2026
Layer 33 has $4 \cdot 32 = 128$ numbers on its perimeter (not including the corners twice). The side length of the square grid up to layer 33 is $2 \cdot 33 - 1 = 65$. The numbers on layer 33 start from the bottom right and move counter-clockwise. The first number of layer 33 is at position $(33, 33)$ if we consider the center of the grid as $(0,0)$ and move in a spiral pattern.

## 8: Calculate the exact position of 2026
Given that 2026 is the 41st number on layer 33, and knowing that each side of the layer has 32 numbers (since $4 \cdot 32 = 128$), we can determine its position. The first 32 numbers are on the bottom side (from right to left), the next 32 on the left side (from bottom to top), the next 32 on the top side (from left to right), and the last 32 on the right side (from top to bottom). Since $41 - 32 = 9$, 2026 is on the left side, 9 numbers up from the bottom.

## 9: Identify the coordinates of 2026
The bottom right corner of layer 33 is at $(32, -32)$, and moving up, the left side's y-coordinate increases. The left side of layer 33 starts at $(-32, -32)$ and ends at $(-32, 32)$. Since 2026 is 9 numbers up from the bottom on the left side, its coordinates are $(-32, -32 + 9) = (-32, -23)$.

## 10: Find the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are at $(-33, -23)$, $(-31, -23)$, $(-32, -24)$, $(-32, -22)$, $(-33, -22)$, $(-31, -22)$, $(-33, -24)$, and $(-31, -24)$.

## 11: Convert coordinates to numbers
To find the numbers at these positions, we must understand the spiral's numbering pattern. However, given the complexity of directly calculating each neighbor's value, we can observe that the spiral increases by 1 as we move in a specific pattern. The difference in numbers between adjacent cells can be derived from the layer and position.

## 12: Calculate the values of the neighbors
However, an efficient approach is to use the fact that 2026 is at $(-32, -23)$. The numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026 are $2026 - 65 = 1961$, $2026 + 65 = 2091$, $2026 - 1 = 2025$, and $2026 + 1 = 2027$, respectively. For diagonals, we consider the pattern and calculate accordingly.

## 13: Diagonal neighbors
The diagonal neighbors can be found by adding or subtracting the layer number times 2 plus 1 (for the diagonal movement in a spiral pattern), but given the coordinates, we can directly infer the numbers or use patterns.

## 14: Sum the neighbors
The direct neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1961, and 2091. The diagonal neighbors can be calculated based on the spiral pattern or inferred from the grid. For a number at position $(x, y)$, its neighbors are $(x-1, y-1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, and $(x+1, y+1)$. Given 2026's position, we calculate or infer these values.

## 15: Final calculation
The four direct neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1961, and 2091. For the diagonals: moving diagonally up-left from 2026 gives $2026 - 66 = 1960$, up-right gives $2026 - 64 = 1962$, down-left gives $2026 + 64 = 2090$, and down-right gives $2026 + 66 = 2092$. Summing all 8 neighbors: $1960 + 1962 + 1961 + 2025 + 2027 + 2090 + 2091 + 2092$.

## 16: Perform the sum
$1960 + 1962 = 3922$, $3922 + 1961 = 5883$, $5883 + 2025 = 7908$, $7908 + 2027 = 9935$, $9935 + 2090 = 12025$, $12025 + 2091 = 14116$, $14116 + 2092 = 16208$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16208}$
