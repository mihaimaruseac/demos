## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a square grid, starting from the center and moving in a clockwise direction. The numbers increase consecutively as we move along the spiral.

## 2: Identify the location of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the location of 2026, we first need to understand how the spiral is constructed and find the layer or ring it belongs to. The spiral can be thought of as a series of concentric squares, with each square having 4 sides and the number of cells on each side increasing by 2 for each subsequent square.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
Let's denote the number of cells on a side of the $n$th square as $2n-1$. The total number of cells up to and including the $n$th square is $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 4n^2 - 4n + 1$. We need to find $n$ such that $4n^2 - 4n + 1 \geq 2026$.

## 4: Solve for n
Solving $4n^2 - 4n + 1 \geq 2026$:
$4n^2 - 4n - 2025 \geq 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, $n = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-2025)}}{2 \cdot 4}$.
$n = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 32400}}{8}$.
$n = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{32416}}{8}$.
$n = \frac{4 \pm 180}{8}$.
Thus, $n = \frac{4 + 180}{8} = 23$ or $n = \frac{4 - 180}{8} = -22.25$. Since $n$ must be positive, $n = 23$.

## 5: Find the position of 2026 in its layer
The total number of cells up to the 22nd layer is $4 \cdot 22^2 - 4 \cdot 22 + 1 = 4 \cdot 484 - 4 \cdot 22 + 1 = 1936 - 88 + 1 = 1849$. This means 2026 is in the 23rd layer. The 23rd layer starts with $1849 + 1 = 1850$. The number of cells in the 23rd layer is $4 \cdot 23 - 4 = 88$. Since $2026 - 1850 = 176$, and there are 88 numbers in the layer, we can find the position of 2026.

## 6: Calculate the exact position of 2026
The layer has 88 numbers, and since it's a square with side length $4 \cdot 23 - 4 = 88$, but actually, the side length is 44 (as each side of the square has 44 cells, not 88, my mistake in calculation). The correct approach is to see that 2026 is the $176^{th}$ number in the layer. The layer starts from 1850, and we need to find which side 2026 falls into and its position on that side.

## 7: Determine the side and position of 2026
The perimeter of the inner square (not including the current layer) is $4 \cdot 43 = 172$. This leaves $176 - 172 = 4$ numbers into the next side for 2026. Given that the first number of the layer (1850) is at the bottom right, moving clockwise, the sides correspond to: bottom (increasing), left (increasing), top (increasing), right (increasing). So, 2026 is on the left side.

## 8: Find the coordinates of 2026
The center of the spiral is (0,0). The side length of the square containing 2026 is $2 \cdot 23 - 1 = 45$. The coordinates of the bottom left corner of this square are $(-22, -22)$. Since 2026 is the 4th number on the left side, and assuming the bottom right corner of the inner square is at $(21, -21)$ (considering the layer's structure), we adjust to find 2026's coordinates. The left side's x-coordinate is $-22 + 23 = 1$ less than the center's x-coordinate in terms of layering, but we must account for its position. The y-coordinate decreases as we move up. If 1850 is at $(21, -21)$, then moving 4 steps up (as 2026 is 4th on the left side), 2026 is at $(-11, -18)$ because we move up from the bottom.

## 9: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are at $(-12, -18)$, $(-10, -18)$, $(-11, -19)$, $(-11, -17)$, $(-12, -17)$, $(-10, -17)$, $(-11, -19)$, and $(-11, -17)$ but considering the actual grid and spiral pattern, we focus on direct neighbors which would be:
- Above: $(-11, -17)$
- Below: $(-11, -19)$
- Left: $(-12, -18)$
- Right: $(-10, -18)$
- Top-left: $(-12, -17)$
- Top-right: $(-10, -17)$
- Bottom-left: $(-12, -19)$
- Bottom-right: $(-10, -19)$

## 10: Calculate the values of the neighbors
To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026, we should directly calculate or infer based on pattern. However, given the nature of the spiral and without loss of generality, let's assume we find the numbers directly:
- The number before 2026 (if moving clockwise) would help in deducing neighbors.

## 11: Direct calculation approach
Considering a more direct approach to solve:
The layer of 2026 has a side length of 45. If 2026 is at $(-11, -18)$, its neighbors are directly calculated based on their positions.

## 12: Calculate the sum of neighbors
Assuming 2026 is at position $(x, y)$, its neighbors are at $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x, y+1)$, $(x-1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x+1, y+1)$. For $(-11, -18)$:
- $(-12, -18) = 2025$
- $(-10, -18) = 2027$
- $(-11, -19) = 2025 - 45 = 1980$
- $(-11, -17) = 2026 + 45 = 2071$
- $(-12, -17) = 2070$
- $(-10, -17) = 2072$
- $(-12, -19) = 1980 - 1 = 1979$
- $(-10, -19) = 1981$

## 13: Sum the neighbors
Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 1980 + 2071 + 2070 + 2072 + 1979 + 1981$.

## 14: Perform the summation
Sum = $2025 + 2027 = 4052$,
$4052 + 1980 = 6032$,
$6032 + 2071 = 8103$,
$8103 + 2070 = 10173$,
$10173 + 2072 = 12245$,
$12245 + 1979 = 14224$,
$14224 + 1981 = 16205$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16205}$
