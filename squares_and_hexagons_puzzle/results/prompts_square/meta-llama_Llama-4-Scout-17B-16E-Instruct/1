## Step 1: Understand the spiral pattern
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are arranged.

## 2: Identify the position of 2026 in the spiral
We need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral to determine its neighbors. The spiral starts from the center and moves outward in a clockwise direction.

## 3: Determine the layer of 2026
To find the layer of 2026, we note that each layer is a square with a side length that increases by 2 for each subsequent layer. The first layer (1) has a side length of 1, the second layer (1-4) has a side length of 3, the third layer (5-16) has a side length of 5, and so on. The $n$th layer has a side length of $2n-1$. The number of elements in each layer forms a sequence of odd numbers: 1, 9, 25, ...

## 4: Calculate the layer of 2026
Let's calculate which layer 2026 falls into. The total number of elements up to and including the $n$th layer can be represented as $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 = (2n-1)^2$. We need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026$.

## 5: Solve for n
Solving $(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026$, we get $2n-1 \geq \sqrt{2026}$. Since $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.0$, $2n-1 \geq 45$, which gives $2n \geq 46$ and thus $n \geq 23$. So, 2026 is in the 23rd layer.

## 6: Find the side length of the layer of 2026
The side length of the 23rd layer is $2*23 - 1 = 45$.

## 7: Determine the position of 2026 in its layer
Since $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, located at the top-right corner of its layer.

## 8: Identify the coordinates of 2026
Given that 2026 is at the top-right corner of its layer, and assuming the center of the spiral is at (0,0), we can find its coordinates. The 22nd layer has a side length of 43, and its total numbers are $43^2 = 1849$. The 23rd layer starts at 1849 + 1 = 1850. Since 2026 is the 177th number in the 23rd layer ($2026 - 1850 + 1 = 177$), and each side has 45 numbers, we can determine its position. The layer is 45x45, and 2026 being the first number, its coordinates can be considered as (22, 22) if we were counting from 0, but since it's the corner, we adjust our understanding to the grid layout.

## 9: Find the coordinates of 2026 on the grid
The coordinates of 2026 can be determined by understanding it's at the start of the layer, which would place it at $(22*45/2 + 22, 22*45/2 - 22)$ if we were calculating from the center, but given it's a corner and we know the layer size, we simplify by recognizing 2026 is at the corner of a 45x45 grid that represents the 23rd layer. The actual coordinates in a grid that starts from 1 would reflect its position relative to the layer's start.

## 10: Calculate the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally from 2026. Given 2026's position at the corner of its layer, its neighbors will be:
- Above: 2025
- Below: 2027
- Left: 1981 (since 2026 - 45 = 1981)
- Right: 2071 (since 2026 + 45 = 2071)
- Top-left: 1980
- Top-right: 2025 (already counted)
- Bottom-left: 1982
- Bottom-right: 2072

## 11: Correctly identify unique neighbors
The unique neighbors are 1980, 1981, 1982, 2025, 2027, 2071, 2072.

## 12: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Sum = 1980 + 1981 + 1982 + 2025 + 2027 + 2071 + 2072.

## 13: Perform the addition
Sum = 1980 + 1981 = 3961,
3961 + 1982 = 5943,
5943 + 2025 = 7968,
7968 + 2027 = 9995,
9995 + 2071 = 12066,
12066 + 2072 = 14138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14138}$
