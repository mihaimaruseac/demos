I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0) - move right
- 3 is at (1,1) - move up
- 4 is at (0,1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1,1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1,0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1,-1) - move down
- 8 is at (0,-1) - move right
- 9 is at (1,-1) - move right

The spiral moves in layers. Each complete layer around the center adds a square ring.

Let me find which layer contains 2026.

Layer 0: just number 1
Layer 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
Layer 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
Layer 3: numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
Layer k: contains 8k numbers

The total numbers up to layer k: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 8k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1

I need to find k such that 2026 is in layer k.

For layer k-1: 4(k-1)² + 4(k-1) + 1 < 2026 ≤ 4k² + 4k + 1

Let me estimate: √(2026/4) ≈ √506.5 ≈ 22.5

So k should be around 22 or 23.

For k = 22: 4(22)² + 4(22) + 1 = 4(484) + 88 + 1 = 1936 + 88 + 1 = 2025
For k = 23: 4(23)² + 4(23) + 1 = 4(529) + 92 + 1 = 2116 + 92 + 1 = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23, and it's the (2026 - 2025) = 1st number in layer 23.

In layer k, the spiral starts at the bottom-right corner at position (k, -k+1) and moves right.

For layer 23, we start at position (23, -22).
The first number in layer 23 (which is 2026) is at position (23, -22).

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -21): This is 2026 - 1 = 2025
- (22, -22): This is 2026 - 2 = 2024  
- (22, -23): This is 2026 - 3 = 2023
- (23, -23): This is 2026 + (8×23 - 1) = 2026 + 183 = 2209
- (24, -23): This is 2026 + (8×23) = 2026 + 184 = 2210
- (24, -22): This is 2026 + (8×23 + 1) = 2026 + 185 = 2211
- (24, -21): This is 2026 + (8×23 + 2) = 2026 + 186 = 2212
- (23, -21): This is 2026 - (8×22 + 1) = 2026 - 177 = 1849

Wait, let me recalculate this more systematically.

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, and layer 22 ends with 2025, the position of 2026 is at (23, -22) (bottom-right start of layer 23).

The 8 neighbors are at positions:
(22, -21), (22, -22), (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21), (23, -21)

To find these values:
- (22, -22): This is the last position of layer 22, so it's 2025
- (22, -21): This is 2025 - 1 = 2024
- (22, -23): This is 2025 - 2×22 + 1 = 2025 - 43 = 1982
- (23, -23): This is 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (24, -23): This is 2027 + 1 = 2028
- (24, -22): This is 2028 + 1 = 2029  
- (24, -21): This is 2029 + 1 = 2030
- (23, -21): This is in the previous layer, 2024 - 1 = 2023

The 8 neighbors are: 1982, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030

Sum = 1982 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 16,168
