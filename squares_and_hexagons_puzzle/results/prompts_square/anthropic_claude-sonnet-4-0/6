I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0) - move right
- 3 is at (1,1) - move up
- 4 is at (0,1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1,1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1,0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1,-1) - move down
- 8 is at (0,-1) - move right
- 9 is at (1,-1) - move right

The spiral moves in layers. Let me find which layer contains 2026.

The spiral completes squares around the center:
- Layer 0: just number 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)²

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer 1 ends at 3² = 9
- Layer 2 ends at 5² = 25
- Layer 3 ends at 7² = 49
- Layer k ends at (2k+1)²

I need (2k+1)² ≥ 2026
2k+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
2k ≥ 44.01
k ≥ 22.005

So 2026 is in layer 22.

Layer 22 starts at (2×22-1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850
Layer 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025

Wait, this means 2026 is actually in layer 23.

Layer 23 starts at 45² + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026

So 2026 is the first number in layer 23!

In each layer, the spiral starts at the bottom-right corner and moves right, then up, then left, then down.

For layer 23, the bottom-right corner is at position (23, -23).
Since 2026 is the first number in this layer, it's at position (23, -23).

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -23):
- (22, -24): This is 1 position left and 1 down
- (23, -24): This is 1 position down  
- (24, -24): This is 1 position right and 1 down
- (22, -23): This is 1 position left
- (24, -23): This is 1 position right
- (22, -22): This is 1 position left and 1 up
- (23, -22): This is 1 position up
- (24, -22): This is 1 position right and 1 up

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since 2026 is at the start of layer 23, I need to trace back through layer 22 to find the neighboring values.

Layer 22 goes from 1850 to 2025.
The side length of layer 22 is 2×22 = 44.

In layer 22:
- Starts at (22, -22) with value 1850
- Goes right 44 steps to (22, 22) 
- Goes up 44 steps to (-22, 22)
- Goes left 44 steps to (-22, -22)  
- Goes down 43 steps to (21, -22), ending with 2025

Let me recalculate the position of 2026 more carefully.

Actually, let me use the fact that 2026 = 45² + 1.

The number n = 45² = 2025 is at position (22, -22).
The number 2026 = 45² + 1 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of (23, -22) are at positions:
(22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23), (22, -22), (24, -22), (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)

Now I need to find the values at these positions:
- (22, -22) = 2025 (this is 45²)
- (23, -23) = 2027 (next number in the spiral)
- (24, -22) = 2028 
- (23, -21) = 2029
- (22, -21) = 2030
- (22, -23) = 2024
- (24, -23) = ?
- (24, -21) = ?

Following the spiral pattern more systematically:
2026 → 2027 → 2028 → 2029 → ... continues right then up

The 8 neighbors have values: 2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 2031, 2028, 2029, 2030.

Sum = 2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2027 + 2031 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 16,237.

However, let me verify this using the property that in such spirals, the sum of 8 neighbors of any number n (not on the edge) equals 8n.

Sum of neighbors of 2026 = 8 × 2026 = 16,208.
