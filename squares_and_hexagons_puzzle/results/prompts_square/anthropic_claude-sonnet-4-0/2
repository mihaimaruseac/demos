I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then identify its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Down to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Up to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9, 10
- And so on...

The spiral forms concentric square rings around the center. Let me find which ring contains 2026.

Ring 0: just the center (1)
Ring 1: positions 2-9 (8 numbers)
Ring 2: positions 10-25 (16 numbers)
Ring 3: positions 26-49 (24 numbers)
Ring k: contains 8k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The total numbers up to ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1

I need to find which ring contains 2026.

For ring k: 4k² + 4k + 1 ≥ 2026
4k² + 4k - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: k = (-4 ± √(16 + 32400))/8 = (-4 ± √32416)/8 = (-4 ± 180.04)/8

Taking the positive root: k ≈ 22.005

So 2026 is in ring 22.

Ring 21 ends at: 4(21)² + 4(21) + 1 = 4(441) + 84 + 1 = 1764 + 84 + 1 = 1849
Ring 22 starts at: 1850 and ends at: 4(22)² + 4(22) + 1 = 4(484) + 88 + 1 = 1936 + 88 + 1 = 2025
Ring 23 starts at: 2026

So 2026 is actually the first number in ring 23!

In each ring, the spiral moves in this pattern:
- Right along the bottom
- Up along the right side  
- Left along the top
- Down along the left side

For ring 23, the side length is 2(23) + 1 = 47.

Since 2026 is the first number in ring 23, it's at the bottom-right corner of ring 22, and we're about to start moving right along the bottom of ring 23.

Actually, let me reconsider the structure. The number 2026 starts ring 23, which means it's positioned at the bottom-right position where we begin the new ring.

Looking at the pattern more carefully:
- Ring 22 has its bottom-right corner at position 2025
- Position 2026 is one step right from there

Let me work out the coordinates. If I place 1 at origin (0,0), then:
- 2 is at (1,0)
- 3 is at (1,-1)
- 4 is at (0,-1)
- And so on...

For ring 22, the bottom-right corner (position 2025) is at coordinates (22, -22).
Position 2026 is one step right, so it's at (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at coordinates:
(22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21), (22, -22), (24, -22), (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Position (22, -22) = 2025 (end of ring 22)
Position (24, -22) = 2027 (next in sequence)
Position (23, -21) corresponds to moving up one row
Position (23, -23) corresponds to moving down one row

By tracing the spiral pattern carefully:
- (22, -22): 2025
- (24, -22): 2027  
- (22, -21): 1850 (this was the start of the bottom edge of ring 22)
- (23, -21): 1851
- (24, -21): 1852
- (22, -23): 1849 (end of ring 21, bottom-right corner)
- (23, -23): 1848
- (24, -23): 1847

The sum is: 2025 + 2027 + 1850 + 1851 + 1852 + 1849 + 1848 + 1847 = 16249

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is 16249.
