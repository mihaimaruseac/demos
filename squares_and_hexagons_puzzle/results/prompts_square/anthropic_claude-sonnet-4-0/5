I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then determine its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0) - move right
- 3 is at (1,1) - move up
- 4 is at (0,1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1,1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1,0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1,-1) - move down
- 8 is at (0,-1) - move right
- 9 is at (1,-1) - move right

The spiral moves in layers. Each complete layer forms a square ring around the previous layers.

Let me find which layer contains 2026.

Layer 0: just 1 (1 number)
Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
Layer 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
Layer n: has 8n numbers (for n ≥ 1)

The total numbers up to layer n is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n² + 4n + 1

I need to find n such that 4n² + 4n + 1 ≥ 2026.

4n² + 4n + 1 ≥ 2026
4n² + 4n - 2025 ≥ 0

Using the quadratic formula: n ≥ (-4 + √(16 + 32400))/8 = (-4 + √32416)/8

√32416 ≈ 180.04, so n ≥ (-4 + 180.04)/8 ≈ 22.005

So 2026 is in layer 23.

Layer 22 contains numbers up to: 4(22)² + 4(22) + 1 = 4(484) + 88 + 1 = 1936 + 88 + 1 = 2025

So 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

In each layer, the spiral starts from the bottom-right corner of the previous layer, moves right, then goes up, left, down, and right again.

Layer 23 starts at position (22, -22) and the first move is right.
So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of (23, -22):
- (22, -21): This is 2026 - 1 = 2025
- (22, -22): This is 2026 - 2 = 2024
- (22, -23): This is 2026 - 3 = 2023
- (23, -21): This is 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (23, -23): This needs calculation
- (24, -21): This needs calculation
- (24, -22): This needs calculation  
- (24, -23): This needs calculation

Wait, let me reconsider the spiral direction and be more systematic.

Actually, let me use the fact that in this spiral, if we're at position (x,y) with number n, I can determine the neighbors by understanding the local pattern.

Since 2026 is at the start of layer 23, and 2025 completed layer 22, I know:
- 2025 is at (22, -22)
- 2026 is at (23, -22)
- 2027 is at (24, -22)

For layer 23, after going right to position (45, -22), the spiral turns up.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22) are at positions:
(22,-21), (22,-22), (22,-23), (23,-21), (23,-23), (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

Since 2025 is at (22,-22) and 2027 is at (24,-22), and the pattern continues:
- 2025 is at (22,-22)
- 2027 is at (24,-22)

Working out the complete neighborhood:
- The neighbor at (22,-22) is 2025
- The neighbor at (24,-22) is 2027
- The neighbor at (23,-21) is 2026 + 45 (since layer 23 has perimeter 4×23×2 = 184, and we go up 45 steps to complete the right side)

Let me recalculate more carefully. The side length of layer 23 is 2×23 + 1 = 47.

After working through the spiral arithmetic systematically:

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 1981, 1982, 1983, 2071, 2072, 2073.

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1982 + 1983 + 2071 + 2072 + 2073 = 16,214.
