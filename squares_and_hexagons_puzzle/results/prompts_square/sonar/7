I need to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 in a square spiral grid where numbers are arranged starting from 1 at the center.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and expands outward in a counter-clockwise direction: right, up, left, down, repeating with increasing step counts[2].

**Finding the position of 2026:**

The spiral forms square layers. For any number n, I need to determine which layer it's in and its position within that layer.

Layer k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)². Since √2026 ≈ 45, I check:
- Layer 22: (2·22-1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1850 to 45² = 2025
- Layer 23: 45² + 1 = 2026 to 47² = 2209

So 2026 is the first number in layer 23, which means it's at the starting position of this new layer.

**Understanding the spiral structure:**

In this spiral pattern, after completing layer k at position 2025, the next number 2026 begins layer 23. The spiral moves: right 1, up 1, left 2, down 2, right 3, up 3, left 4, down 4, etc.

Position 2025 (end of layer 22) is at coordinates (22, -22) if we place 1 at origin (0, 0). The number 2026 moves one step right to position (23, -22).

**Finding the 8 neighbors of 2026:**

The 8 neighbors at position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -23): part of layer 22's left side
- (23, -23): part of layer 22's bottom-left corner
- (24, -23): part of layer 23's expanding right side
- (24, -22): part of layer 23's right side
- (24, -21): part of layer 23's right side
- (23, -21): part of layer 23
- (22, -21): part of layer 22

Through the spiral structure analysis[2], when moving along boundaries, odd layers increase in one direction while even layers decrease. Layer 22 (even) and layer 23 (odd) follow complementary patterns.

Working through the spiral coordinates:
- 2025 is at (22, -22)
- 2026 is at (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021

**Calculating the sum:**

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021
Sum = (2025 + 2029) + (2027 + 2028) + (2024 + 2023) + (2022 + 2021)
Sum = 4054 + 4055 + 4047 + 4043
Sum = **16,199**
