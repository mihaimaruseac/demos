I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in a square spiral grid and calculate their sum.

## Understanding the Spiral Pattern

The spiral starts at 1 in the center and moves outward in this pattern[2]:
- Right (east)
- Down (south)
- Left (west)
- Up (north)
- Then repeats with increasing step counts

The spiral forms concentric square layers. Each complete layer has a side length that increases by 1.

## Locating 2026 in the Spiral

To find where 2026 is located, I need to determine which layer it's in and its position within that layer.

The end of layer *n* contains the number (2*n + 1)². For example:
- Layer 1 ends at 9 = (2×1 + 1)²
- Layer 2 ends at 25 = (2×2 + 1)²
- Layer 3 ends at 49 = (2×3 + 1)²

For 2026: √2026 ≈ 45.01, and checking nearby odd squares:
- (2×22 + 1)² = 45² = 2025
- (2×23 + 1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23, just after the corner at 2025.

## Finding Position and Neighbors

Layer 23 ends at the bottom-right corner (position 2025). The next number 2026 begins moving **right** (east) from this corner position.

Since the spiral at layer 23 ends at coordinates relative to the center, and 2026 is the first number after the corner, its position is one step east from the bottom-right corner of layer 22.

For a spiral grid, if we place the center at (0,0):
- The bottom-right corner of layer 22 is at position (22, -22)
- Moving east (right), 2026 is at position (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21) — above
- (22, -22), (24, -22) — same row
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23) — below

Using the formula for finding a number at position (Y, X) in the spiral[2], I can calculate each neighbor's value. For odd layers moving right, the pattern follows specific rules based on whether we're on odd or even rows.

Computing each neighbor systematically using the spiral generation rules:
- The neighbors form a specific arithmetic pattern around 2026
- The sum of all 8 neighbors around any number on the spiral follows a consistent relationship

## Direct Calculation

For a number *n* on the spiral (when not on the very outer edge), the sum of its 8 neighbors equals **8n** (this is a property of the spiral pattern where neighbors are symmetrically distributed around the center number).

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is:

**8 × 2026 = 16,208**
