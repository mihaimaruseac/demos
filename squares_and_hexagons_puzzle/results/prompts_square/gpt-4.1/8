Let's analyze the problem systematically.

We are given a **square spiral** of natural numbers on a grid, whose layout for small numbers looks like this:

```
...  5   4   3 ...
...  6   1   2 ...
...  7   8   9 ...
```

Notice how the spiral **starts with 1 at the center**, then goes to 2 (right), 3 (up), 4 (left), 5 (left), 6 (down), 7 (down), 8 (right), and so on.

We are asked:

> **What is the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026?**

---

# **Step 1: Find the Coordinates of 2026**

Let’s map out how to find which coordinates \( (x, y) \) will correspond to 2026, and identify its neighbors.

## **Understanding the Spiral**

- The spiral expands in "layers": squares of size \(1\times1\), \(3\times3\), \(5\times5\), etc.
- The bottom-right corner of the \(n \times n\) layer contains the number \(n^2\) (for odd \(n\)).
- For layer \(k\) (\(k=0\) is center: 1), side length is \(2k+1\), and numbers range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1\) up to \( (2k+1)^2\).

Let's quickly check a few cases:

- \(k=0\): \(n=1\), "shell" contains 1 at (0, 0)
- \(k=1\): \(n=3\), numbers from 2 to 9
- \(k=2\): \(n=5\), numbers from 10 to 25
- etc.

So for each layer \(k\), the numbers on the outer edge go from \((2k-1)^2+1\) up to \((2k+1)^2\).

## **Find the Layer for 2026**

Set \( (2k+1)^2 \geq 2026 \).

\[
(2k+1)^2 \geq 2026
\]
\[
2k+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45
\]
\[
2k+1 \geq 45 \implies k \geq 22
\]

Let's check what numbers correspond to \(k = 22\) and \(k = 21\):

- For \(k=21\): Side length 43; last number \(43^2 = 1849\)
- For \(k=22\): Side length 45; last number \(45^2 = 2025\)
- For \(k=23\): Side length 47; last number \(47^2 = 2209\)

Now,
- Layer \(k=21\) goes up to 1849
- Layer \(k=22\) goes from \( (2*21+1)^2 +1 =43^2 +1=1850 \) to 2025 (inclusive)
- **2026** must be in layer \(k=23\), as \(2026>2025.\)

Layer \(k=23\) starts at:
- \(43^2 = 1849\)
- \( \text{Layer } k = x : (\text{side length } = 2k+1)\)
- **Each new layer starts with the next number after previous layer's max.**

But, double-check this:

\(n=47\) (side length), last of previous layer is \(45^2 = 2025\), so **layer \(k=23\) starts at 2026**.

## **So, 2026 is at the lower right corner of the (next) square.**

Following the spiral, let's check how the numbers are laid in each layer.

# **Step 2: Find Neighbors of 2026**

Since 2026 is the **first number on a new layer**, it must be at the "corner"—specifically, the bottom right corner.

Let’s check how the spiral fills for the corner numbers:

For layer \(k\), side length is \(n=2k+1\). The four corners of the square have these numbers (starting at the bottom right and going counterclockwise):

- **Lower right corner**: \(n^2\)
- Lower left: \(n^2 - (n-1)\)
- Upper left: \(n^2 - 2(n-1)\)
- Upper right: \(n^2 - 3(n-1)\)

But as we step **to layer \(n+2\) (next layer)**, the first number (after \(n^2\)) is \(n^2+1\), which is at bottom right, but now on the next ring **outward, just to the right of the previous bottom right corner**.

But let's make a diagram for a small case to be sure. Layer for \(n=3\):
```
5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9
```
- (1,1) is '9', (for n=3), down to (3,3).

Next layer \(n=5\):
```
17 16 15 14 13
18  5  4  3 12
19  6  1  2 11
20  7  8  9 10
21 22 23 24 25
```

25 is lower right (5,5), then next layer:
```
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49
```

49 is lower right (7,7). 50 is immediately after, starting next layer \(n=9\) at (8,7). So, **the first number of a new layer is immediately to the right of the previous bottom right corner**.

In our grid, the spiral initial coordinates are as follows, with (0,0) at the center (which is 1):

- right movement: increases X
- up: increases Y
- left: decreases X
- down: decreases Y

As the spiral unfolds, every new layer begins immediately to the right (in the +X direction) of the lower right corner.

Thus, **the first number \( (2k+1)^2 + 1 \) for layer \(k+1\) is at coordinates \( (k+1, -k) \).**

So for 1 at (0,0):

This is geometric, but perhaps it might be faster to just see that **2026** is at the bottom right "corner" of the next layer just after 45×45=2025, i.e. at (23, -22).

But more generally, at each layer, as the spiral grows, new maximum value \(n^2\) for \(n=2k+1\) is at \((k,-k)\), i.e. \( (k, -k) \) for the bottom right corner.

So

\(k\) = number of "layers" from the center, so shell 0 is center, shell 1 is the ring around it, shell 2 the next, etc.

Layer with side \(2k+1\) has bottom right corner at \((k,-k)\).

- The next number—the first number in the next shell, i.e. \( (2k+1)^2+1 \)—goes to the **right**: coordinate \((k+1,-k)\).

For shell with \(k=22\), side 45, max is \(2025 = 45^2\), coordinates at (22, -22).

- Therefore, \(2026=2025+1\) is at \((23, -22)\) (one to the right).

# **Step 3: Identify the 8 Neighbors' Coordinates**

The 8 neighbors of \((23, -22)\) are:

- (22, -23)
- (23, -23)
- (24, -23)
- (22, -22)
- (24, -22)
- (22, -21)
- (23, -21)
- (24, -21)

We need to find the numbers at each of those coordinates.

# **Step 4: Find the Numbers at Those Coordinates**

For a spiral with center at (0,0), and with the rule as above, to get the number at any given coordinates is a known puzzle.

But let's use the observation that **numbers immediately before or after 2026 will be nearby**.

Noting that \(2026 = (45)^2 + 1\), and that it's the first number on the shell with side 47 (\(k=23\)), let's see how the spiral expands after this point.

In general, after the first number of a new shell, the spiral proceeds:

- Right (to new shell): one step
- Up: steps of length (current shell) i.e. \(2k+2\)
- Left: length \(2k+2\)
- Down: length \(2k+2\)
- Right: length \(2k+2\)
  ([see Ulam spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))

At 2026 at \((23,-22)\), which is the start of the outermost shell.

Let's map the first few numbers of this shell:

\[
\begin{align*}
2026: & (23, -22) \\
2027: & (23, -21) \quad \text{(up)} \\
2028: & (23, -20) \\
2029: & (23, -19) \\
\ldots \\
\text{How many steps up?} \\
\text{For shell } k=23, \text{ side } 47, \text{ outer ring, length } 47
\end{align*}
\]

From previous shells, the movement at start of a new layer is:

1. Move **right 1** (from bottom-right corner to start of next shell): that's 2026 at (23,-22).
2. Move **up** **side length** (i.e. 47 steps): from \((23,-22)\) to \((23,24)\). So
    - (23,-22): 2026 (start)
    - (23,-21): 2027
    - (23,-20): 2028
    - ...
    - (23,-22 + n): 2026 + n, for \(n = 0\) to \(46\).
      So
    - (23, -21): 2027
    - (23, -20): 2028
    - up to (23, 24): 2026+46=2072

Then, after reaching (23,24), turns **left**, moving along y=24, decreasing x.

So:

- (22,24): 2073
- (21,24): 2074
- ...

And so on. But we can see that, for neighboring positions, we just need to look at:

- (23, -21): 2027 (by above)
- (24, -22): Starting at (23,-22):2026. Now, the ring consists of walking up, then left, etc. Potentially (24,-22) might not be filled until the last leg of the shell.

Let's also check the numbers at the other positions.

**We can now fill in neighbor values:**

## **(23, -21):**

As above, (23, -21): **2027**

## **(24, -22):**

When does this get filled? After moving from (23,24) to (23,-22), do we ever touch (24,-22)? That will be the very last step along the bottom side: start at (24,24) and move down to (24,-22). There are 47 steps down from (24,24) to (24,-22):

- (24,24): after left movement from (23,24) to (24,24): this would be number after (23,24) (2072): 2073 (at (22,24)), but that's along left movement, so perhaps (24,24) is the first entry of last segment, which is moving down.

But regardless: The path is
- Up along x=23, y from -22 to 24 (2026 to 2072)
- Left along y=24, x from 23 to -23 (2073 to 2119)
- Down along x=-23, y from 24 to -23 (2120 to 2166)
- Right along y=-23, x from -23 to 24 (2167 to 2213)

(24,-22) is along the final segment, so let's count along the last segment.

After reaching (-23,-23) we are at 2166, then moving right increases x:

- (-22,-23): 2167
- (-21,-23): 2168
- ... etc.

At each step, x increases by 1, y=-23. Our target for (24,-22) is x=24, y=-22.

Wait, but at y=-23, x=24, that's just before we move up along x=24, y=-23 to y=24, i.e., the final run.

But the corners coordinates in the outermost shell are:

- (23,-22): start of shell—2026 (as above)
- (23,24): after up—2072
- (-23,24): after left—2119
- (-23,-23): after down—2166
- (24,-23): after right—2213

How many steps from (23,-22) to (24,-22)? Each time we go along the shell's perimeter.

But is (24,-22) adjacent to (23,-22)? Yes, they share an edge. But (24,-22) is not filled until the very last step of the shell, which is right along x, at y=-23. But that's at y=-23, so the immediate neighbor at (24,-22) will be filled after the full circuit.

Perhaps the best way is to realize that in the spiral, the *lowest* possible number among all eight neighbors of (23,-22) will be smaller than 2026, and the *largest* will be much larger.

But let's look at the pattern in the small example. In the 5x5 case:

```
17 16 15 14 13
18  5  4  3 12
19  6  1  2 11
20  7  8  9 10
21 22 23 24 25
```

The "corner" 25 connects to previous spiral at (5,5).

The position after the old layer is (6,5): which is the start of new layer? Let's check if the way of filling is as above.

Alternatively, let’s try a more general approach.

# **Alternate View: The Neighbors of the Starting Point of a New Shell**

At the start (first number) of a new shell (2026), this cell is immediately adjacent to the previous bottom right corner (2025). The other neighbors will be either from the previous shell or, in the majority, from the new shell as it fills completely around the periphery.

In particular, in a spiral, **the first number of a new shell has as its immediate left and lower neighbor the old shell's bottom right corner**, and the rest of its neighbors are as yet unfilled (will be filled as you go around the new shell).

The configuration is:

- Let’s assign the current number at (k+1, -k), the new shell’s starting point (2026)
- immediate left: (k, -k) — which is (2025), previous shell’s bottom-right
- immediate bottom-left: (k, -k-1): last segment of prior shell
- immediate bottom: (k+1, -k-1): will be filled at the very end of current shell (2026 + total perimeter - 1)
- immediate bottom-right: (k+2, -k-1): will be filled after bottom
- immediate right: (k+2, -k): will be filled after above
- immediate top-right: (k+2, -k+1): will be filled on left segment
- immediate top: (k+1, -k+1): will be filled sooner
- immediate top-left: (k, -k+1): filled in previous shell? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we notice that **the 8 neighbors of the start of a shell are**:

- **The smallest:** The previous layer's maximum, which is adjacent (i.e. 2025)
- **The largest:** The new layer's maximum (i.e. one full perimeter step ahead: length of perimeter is \(4*(side length-1)\), which for a 47×47 square is 184)
- The rest are spaced evenly around as you fill the perimeter.

But here’s the crucial shortcut:

## **Each time you move to the _next shell_ with starting number \(N\), the neighbors are:**
- The previous shell's max (immediately to the left)
- The next 7 numbers, as you fill the shell, are written in consecutive cells nearby, with the numbers being \(N+1,\, N+2,\, ...,\, N+7\).

Thus, **the 8 neighbors of the 'first cell' of a new shell (like 2026) are:**

\[
2025,\ 2027,\ 2028,\ 2213,\ 2214,\ 2215,\ 2216,\ 2217
\]
But let's check this more closely.

Alternatively, let's step through the filling order.

- (23, -22): 2026 (start of layer k=23, side=47, previous shell max=2025)
- (23, -21): 2027 (move up)
- (23, -20): 2028
- ...
- (23, 24): 2026 + 46 = 2072 (after 47 steps)
- (22, 24): 2073 (start of left movement), etc.
- left along y=24: (22,24):2073, (21,24):2074, ..., (-23,24):2119 (2073 +45)
- down along x=-23: (-23,23):2120, ..., (-23,-23):2166
- right along y=-23: (-22,-23):2167, ..., (24,-23):2213 (with 46 steps)
- up along x=24: (24,-22):2214, up to (24,24):2259.

Now, let's see which coordinates are the neighbors of (23, -22):

- (22, -23): 2167
- (23, -23): 2168
- (24, -23): 2213
- (22, -22): 2025 (previous shell's max)
- (24, -22): 2214
- (22, -21):
  - Here's where things get interesting: Is this coordinate inside the previous shell, or just outside? Let's check.
  - The last run in shell \(k=22\) is up along x=22, from y=-21 up to y=23.
- (23, -21): 2027
- (24, -21): 2215

So, let's map each neighbor to its value:

### **(23, -21):**
- Already have: 2027

### **(24, -22):**
- As above, after the bottom-right run: 2214

### **(24, -23):**
- As above: 2213

### **(23, -23):**
- This is after right movement of bottom edge: when moving along y=-23 from x=-22 up to 24.
- At x=23, y=-23: step after x=22, y=-23: So, after (22, -23): 2167, then (23, -23): 2168, as above.

### **(22, -23):**
- 2167

### **(22, -22):**
- This is back in previous shell (k=22), at (22,-22): the bottom right corner of previous shell: that's 2025

### **(22, -21):**
- This is previous shell, moving up along x=22.
  - Let's recall that, for shell k=22:
    - shell starts at (22,-21): the last up movement along x=22, y from -21 to 23.

Now, in shell k=22, perimeter length is 4 × 44 = 176.

The order for k=22, side=45:

- bottom right corner: (22,-22): 2025
- first number of shell: (22,-21): previous shell's last filled number, which is 2025 — perimeter length + first step up along x=22.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to check the last few numbers in the previous shell:

- The previous shell starts at ((22,-21): value = ???)
- After filling the shell, the last cell filled is (22,-22): 2025

From the filling order, let's reconstruct the path for the final chord along the shell’s bottom edge, which for k=22 is rightwards from (-21,-22) to (22,-22):

- After moving down along x=-22 from y=22 to y=-22
- Then move right along y=-22 from x=-21 up to 22 (44 steps)
- x = 22, y = -22: 2025
- x = 21, y = -22: 2024
- x = 20, y = -22: 2023
- ...
- x = -21, y = -22: ??? (2025 - (22+21) = 2025-43=1982)

So, in all, the bottom right corner is 2025 at (22, -22), and just above it is (22, -21): the last spot above, traced earlier.

From "right" movement (after full right along y=-22), up movement is along x=22. The first step up is from (22,-22) to (22,-21): that would be the next shell, so (22, -21) is already filled in the previous shell before 2025.

From the path, after reaching (22,-22): 2025, the next number is (23,-22): 2026, which is our cell of interest.

Thus, in the previous shell, (22, -21) is filled just before (22,-22).

So, constucting backward:

- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -21): 1981 + (positions between) = ?

But perhaps to infer that in the previous layer, the lower right corner is 2025 at (22, -22), and (22, -21) is directly above, it would have been filled earlier, but with a certain value.

But for our purposes, perhaps it is clear that:

- Among the 8 neighbors of 2026, 3 are in the previous shell (2025, (22,-22); and two more, possibly (22,-21) and (22,-23));
- The other 5 are points that will be filled later in the current shell.

Given the pattern above, the numbers at the 8 neighbors are:

| Coordinates     | Value        |
|:--------------- |-------------|
| (22, -23)       | 2167        |
| (23, -23)       | 2168        |
| (24, -23)       | 2213        |
| (22, -22)       | 2025        |
| (24, -22)       | 2214        |
| (22, -21)       | [previous shell, must calculate]|
| (23, -21)       | 2027        |
| (24, -21)       | 2215        |


Let’s try to find the value at (22, -21):

During the previous shell (k=22, side=45), after going right along y=-22 from x=-21 to 22, then we turn up: moving up along x=22 from y=-22 to y=22.

Let’s step through these:

Along y=-22, x from -21 to 22: start point is (x=-21, y=-22): the last right movement before bottom right corner.

- Let's find which value this is.

The total number of steps along one edge of the shell is 44 (from k=22, side=45, perimeter=4×44=176 steps, excluding corners).

From (22, -22): 2025, the last in the shell.

So:

- (22, -22): 2025
- previous step: (21, -22): 2024
- previous: (20, -22): 2023
- ...
- first along this edge: (x=-21, y=-22): value = 2025 - (22+21) = 2025-43=1982

So, (x=-21, y=-22): 1982
to (x=22, y=-22): 2025

Now, after (22, -22):2025, the path moves up along x=22, y increasing from -22 to 22 (44 steps):

- (22,-21): 2025 + 1 = 2026, but that's already assigned as our current cell’s value at (23, -22).
- Wait: but in our spiral, the next number after (22,-22):2025 is (23, -22):2026 (the next shell).

Therefore, in the k=22 shell, (22, -21) is filled before reaching (22, -22):2025.

So, along x=22, from y=22 down to y=-22, we can trace:

But to avoid confusion, perhaps it's best to focus on the neighbors for which we have definite values, as above.

Thus, for the purposes of this solution, let’s sum the seven numbers for which we have explicit values and realize that (22,-21) is necessarily less than 2025, i.e. filled earlier in the previous shell. The exact value can be computed as follows.

To compute the value at (22, -21):

- After proceeding right along y=-22 from x=-21 to 22, we move up from (22, -22) to (22, -21)
- At (22, -22): 2025
- So, to get to (22, -21): Well, that would have been filled while moving up along x=22

However, for each edge, the number at each step can be computed.

Let’s think recursively: at shell \(k\), for \(2k+1\) side, per previous analysis:

- Bottom right corner: (k,-k), number \(n^2\)
- The shell perimeter has length \(8k\), from \(n=2k+1\)
- The movement from the bottom right up along x=k, y from -k to k.

Let’s compute, for k=22, the mapping for (22,-21):

- start at (22, -22):2025
- previous step in the path: up along x=22, y=-22 to y=22 over 44 steps, but do we move from (22,-22) to (22,-21), or fill (22,-21) previously?

From the initial mapping in our 5x5 and 7x7 examples, and noting the pattern, perhaps we see that (22, -21) is filled earlier than (22, -22):2025, and that the value is:

- At each shell, cells in the last row (as you make your way around the shell) leading up to the corner receive numbers lower by 1 each time.

Since (x=22,y=-22):2025
(x=22,y=-21):2025-final edge movement

That final bottom edge movement fills in (x=21,y=-22):2024, up to (x=-21,y=-22):1982

So, prior to filling (22,-22):2025, the cell (22,-21) lies directly above.

Looking at sample values in small shells, this difference is equal to 44, the side length minus 1:

- From (22,-22):2025, subtract (previous shell perimeter / 4):44

So: Value at (22, -21):2025 - 44 = 1981

Thus, numbers along the edge for shell k=22 (side=45), bottom edge (y=-22), with x from -21 up to 22:

- (x=-21, y=-22):1982
- (x=-20, y=-22):1983
- ...
- (x=22, y=-22):2025

Numbers along the edge above (x=22):

- (x=22, y=-22):2025
- (x=22, y=-21):1981
- (x=22, y=-20):1980

- (x=22, y=22):1936

Wait: The numbers along (x=22) vertical go from 1981 at (22,-21) up to 1936 at (22,22), decreasing by 1 each step? Actually, let’s check with simpler numbers.

But, perhaps the issue is the sequence is filled in decreasing order along this edge.

Alternatively, perhaps (22,-21):1981 as suggested.

# **Final List of Neighbor Values**

Pulling it all together:

| Coordinates     | Value        |
|:--------------- |-------------|
| (22, -23)       | 2167        |
| (23, -23)       | 2168        |
| (24, -23)       | 2213        |
| (22, -22)       | 2025        |
| (24, -22)       | 2214        |
| (22, -21)       | 1981        |
| (23, -21)       | 2027        |
| (24, -21)       | 2215        |

Add these up:

\[
2167 + 2168 + 2213 + 2025 + 2214 + 1981 + 2027 + 2215
\]

Now let's compute that sum:

First, group large and small numbers if possible.

Let's do:

- 2213 + 2214 + 2215 = (2213+2214) + 2215 = 4427 + 2215 = **6642**
- 2167 + 2168 = **4335**
- 2025 + 2027 = **4052**
- 1981

Now sum these:

- Total so far: 6642 + 4335 = 10977; 10977 + 4052 = 15029; 15029 + 1981 = **17010**

**Thus, the sum of the eight neighbors is \(\boxed{17010}\)**

## **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{17010}
