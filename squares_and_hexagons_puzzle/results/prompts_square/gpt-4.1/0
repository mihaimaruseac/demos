Given the spiral (counterclockwise, square grid):

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
5 & 4 & 3 \\
6 & 1 & 2 \\
7 & 8 & 9 \\
\end{array}
\]

Let's **generalize the spiral** and then find the sum of the 8 neighbors of a given number, specifically 2026.

---

### 1. **Understanding the spiral**

Each layer "wraps" around the previous one. The center is 1.

- 1 is at (0,0)
- Numbers increase as we spiral outwards: right, up, left, down, and repeat.

**Sequence of UPPER-RIGHT corners**:  
Layer 0: (0,0) = 1  
Layer 1: (1,1) = 9  
Layer 2: (2,2) = 25  
Layer \( n \): (n,n) = \((2n+1)^2\)  

So, the outermost layer containing a number \( N \) is the minimal \( n \) such that:
\[
(2n-1)^2 < N \leq (2n+1)^2
\]

---

### 2. **Determine the ring (`n`) where 2026 falls**

\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2
\]
Calculate square roots:
\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026 \implies 2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45
\implies 2n \geq 44 \implies n \geq 22
\]

Check:
- \( (2\cdot 21+1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 \)
- \( (2\cdot 22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \)
- \( (2\cdot 23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \)

We have:
- Lower bound: \( 43^2 = 1849 \)
- Upper bound: \( 45^2 = 2025 \)
  \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

So:
\[
1849 < N \leq 2025 \implies n = 22
\]
But \( 2026 > 2025 \), so **n = 23**.

\[
45^2 = 2025 < 2026 \leq 2209 = 47^2 \implies n = 23
\]

---

### 3. **Locate 2026's coordinates**

Each layer forms a square. For layer \( n \), the square runs from \((n,-n)\) (lower right) counterclockwise:

For **layer \( n \):** (ring = 23)

- Side length = \(2n + 1 = 47\)
- Maximum number in this layer = \(47^2 = 2209\)
- Minimum number in this layer (immediately after previous layer): \( (47-2)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026 \)

So:

- **2026 is the smallest number on ring 23!**
- The numbers in this ring range from 2026 up to 2209.

Where does the lowest number of a ring begin?  
- The minimal number is at \((n, -n+1)\) (i.e., just after the bottom right corner), then it traces the perimeter.

But let's check the construction more carefully.

- **Start** for ring \( n \): (n, -n+1), with value \( (2n - 1)^2 + 1 \)
  - (Side breakdown: bottom → left → top → right)

So for \( n = 23 \):

- \((2\cdot23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\)
- So, position: \( (23, -22) \)

---

### 4. **Trace the sequence around the ring**

The ring perimeter is: 4 sides of length \(2n+1\), but the ring consists of \(4 \times (2n) = 92\) steps.

**Sequence around ring:**

1. **Right edge:** From (23, -22) up to (23, 23)
2. **Top edge:** From (23, 23) to (-23, 23)
3. **Left edge:** From (-23, 23) down to (-23, -23)
4. **Bottom edge:** From (-23, -23) to (22, -23)

Each side is length \(2n = 46\), but the corners are only counted once.

Let’s clarify:

- Start at (23, -22): 2026
- Up to (23, 23): increasing y by 1 each time (\(0\) to \(45\)) → 46 steps

So the positions for the first 46 numbers:

- \(k\) from 0 to 45: \((23, -22 + k)\), value = 2026 + k

**Check the identity:**

At (23, -22): 2026  
At (23, 23): \(2026 + 45 = 2071\)

---

### 5. **Get the 8 neighbors of 2026**

2026 is at position \((23, -22)\)

Neighbors are at:

- (22, -23)
- (22, -22)
- (22, -21)
- (23, -23)
- (23, -21)
- (24, -23)
- (24, -22)
- (24, -21)

We need to find what numbers are at these coordinates.

---

#### **Map number to coordinates**

On ring \( n = 23 \):

- The ring starts at (23, -22): 2026
- Traverses up to (23, 23): numbers 2026 to 2071
- Then goes left: (23, 23) to (-23, 23): numbers 2072 to 2117
- Down: (-23, 23) to (-23, -23): numbers 2118 to 2163
- Right: (-23, -23) to (22, -23): numbers 2164 to 2209

**Let's note which positions each neighbor falls into.**

---

Let's break each of the 8 neighbors:

#### A. (22, -23)

This is on the **bottom edge**, since y = -23.

The bottom edge runs from \(( -23, -23 )\) (left) to (22, -23) (right).

Positions on bottom edge:

- x varies from -23 to 22, y = -23
- How many steps from (-23, -23) to (22, -23)?  
That’s from x = -23 to x = 22, which is 46 steps (since \(2n=46\)), matching the pattern.

But what's the value at (-23, -23)?  
- The previous side (down, left edge) ends at (-23, -23): 2163

So bottom edge:

- (-23, -23): 2164
- (-22, -23): 2165
- ...
- (22, -23): 2164 + (22 + 23) = 2164 + 45 = 2209

So at (22, -23): \( 2164 + (22 + 23) = 2164 + 45 = 2209 \) (yes, since side length is 46, as expected for last number in the ring).

**Conclusion:**  
(22, -23) = 2209

---

#### B. (22, -22)

(22, -22): this is inside the spiral (not on the ring), i.e., part of ring 22.

Let’s recall **number at (x, y) in the spiral** is determined by which ring you are on. Here, \( n = \max(|x|, |y|) \).

- For (22, -22), \( n = 22 \)
- The start of ring 22 is at (22, -21), value \( (2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850\)

The ring traverses as before:

- From (22, -21) up to (22, 22): numbers 1850 upward

So (22, -22) is **one y below (22, -21)**, i.e., **doesn't occur** as the spiral path (the starting point is (22, -21) and goes up).

Wait. Let's track:

- Right edge of ring 22: (22, -21) to (22, 22), y goes from -21 to 22

(22, -22) does not occur in the sequence, that would be in the ring inside 22.

Wait: This suggests **the 8-neighbor rule includes numbers from the previous and next ring**, as well as the same ring.

So at (22, -22): **belongs to ring 22**.

We must find the number at (22, -22):

- For ring 22:
    - Start: (22, -21): 1850
    - Moves up: y increases from -21 to 22
    - From (22, -21): 1850
    - (22, -22) would come **before** (22, -21), which isn’t on the spiral path for that ring.

Seems (22, -22) is part of an **inner ring** or not on the spiral path at all. But in the spiral, all positions are filled.

Alternatively, perhaps more methodically, let's find a **general formula** to determine the value at coordinates (x, y):

---

### 6. **General formula for spiral number at (x, y)**

This approach is systematic.

Let \( n = \max(|x|, |y|) \).

- The maximum number in ring \( n \): \( m = (2n+1)^2 \)
- The "side length" for ring \( n \) is \( 2n+1 \)
- The bottom right corner (n, -n): \( m \)
- The bottom left corner (-n, -n): \( m-s \), where \( s = 2n \)
- The top left corner (-n, n): \( m-2s \)
- The top right corner (n, n): \( m-3s \)

Here's how to get the number at \( (x, y) \):

- If \( y = -n \), along bottom edge:
    \[
    \text{number} = m - (n - x)
    \]
- If \( x = -n \), along left edge:
    \[
    \text{number} = m - s - (n + y)
    \]
- If \( y = n \), along top edge:
    \[
    \text{number} = m - 2s - (n + x)
    \]
- If \( x = n \), along right edge:
    \[
    \text{number} = m - 3s - (n - y)
    \]

Let’s check if that fits with our earlier calculations.

For (23, -22):

- \( n = 23 \), \( m = 47^2 = 2209 \), \( s = 46 \)
- \( x = 23 \), \( y = -22 \), so on the right edge.
- \( x = n \), so use the right edge formula:
    \[
    \text{number} = m - 3s - (n - y)
    \]
    \( n - y = 23 - (-22) = 45 \)
    \[
    2209 - 138 - 45 = 2209 - 183 = 2026
    \]
Perfect!

Now proceed to calculate for each neighbor:

---

#### **Neighbors calculations**

Let’s define \( n, m, s \) for the rings involved:

- For ring 23: \( n=23, m=2209, s=46 \)
- For ring 22: \( n=22, m=2025, s=44 \)
- For ring 21: \( n=21, m=1849, s=42 \)
- For ring 24: \( n=24, m=2401, s=48 \)

But for our coordinates, only n=23,22, and 24 are relevant.

**Now, neighbor by neighbor:**

---

#### i) \((22, -23)\), \( n = 23 \), \( x = 22, y = -23 \)

Since \( y = -n \):

\[
\text{number} = m - (n - x) = 2209 - (23 - 22) = 2209 - 1 = 2208
\]

---

#### ii) \((22, -22)\), \( n = 22 \), \( x = 22, y = -22 \)

Which **edge**? \( x = n \):

On ring 22:
- \( n = 22, m = 2025, s = 44 \)
- \( x = 22, y = -22 \), so \( x = n \) **(right edge)**

So,
\[
\text{number} = m - 3s - (n - y) = 2025 - 3 \times 44 - (22 - (-22)) = 2025 - 132 - 44 = 2025 - 176 = 1849
\]

Wait—a sign error: Let’s check calculation:

Examining the formula:
For \( x = n \), right edge, \( m - 3s - (n - y) \), but \( n - y = 22 - (-22) = 44 \):

\[
2025 - 132 - 44 = 2025 - 176 = 1849
\]

So \((22, -22)\) = **1849**

---

#### iii) \((22, -21)\), \( n = 22 \), \( x = 22, y = -21 \):

Again \( x = n \):

\[
\text{number} = 2025 - 132 - (22 - (-21)) = 2025 - 132 - 43 = 2025 - 175 = 1850
\]

---

#### iv) \((23, -23)\), \( n = 23 \), \( x = 23, y = -23 \)

- \( y = -n \)
- \[
\text{number} = 2209 - (23 - 23) = 2209 - 0 = 2209
\]

---

#### v) \((23, -21)\), \( n = 23 \), \( x = 23, y = -21 \):

\( x = n \):

\[
\text{number} = 2209 - 138 - (23 - (-21)) = 2209 - 138 - 44 = 2209 - 182 = 2027
\]

---

#### vi) \((24, -23)\), \( n = 24, m = 2401, s = 48 \):

\( y = -n \) (bottom edge):

\[
\text{number} = 2401 - (24 - 24) = 2401 - 0 = 2401
\]
But \( x = 24, y = -23 \), is this on the right edge or bottom edge? Let's check \( x, y \):

- At \( n = 24 \), bottom edge: y = -n, so \( x \) from -24 to 23.
- \( x = 24 \) is **one step beyond edge**? From earlier, yes, the bottom edge runs from (-24, -24) (left) to (24, -24) (right). For y = -24.
- For y = -23, so \( x = 24 \), y = -23 corresponds to **right edge**, with y from -23 to 24.

Thus, for \( x = n \):

\[
\text{number} = 2401 - 3 \times 48 - (24 - (-23)) = 2401 - 144 - 47 = 2401 - 191 = 2210
\]

---

#### vii) \((24, -22)\), \( n = 24 \):

Again, \( x = n \):

\[
\text{number} = 2401 - 144 - (24 - (-22)) = 2401 - 144 - 46 = 2401 - 190 = 2211
\]

---

#### viii) \((24, -21)\), \( x = n \):

\[
\text{number} = 2401 - 144 - (24 - (-21)) = 2401 - 144 - 45 = 2401 - 189 = 2212
\]

---

### 7. **Sum up all the neighbor numbers**

Let’s collect calculated values:

1. (22, -23): **2208**
2. (22, -22): **1849**
3. (22, -21): **1850**
4. (23, -23): **2209**
5. (23, -21): **2027**
6. (24, -23): **2210**
7. (24, -22): **2211**
8. (24, -21): **2212**

Sum:

\[
2208 + 1849 + 1850 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212
\]

Let’s add step by step:

First, group similarly sized numbers for easier addition:

- 2208 + 2209 = 4417
- 2210 + 2211 = 4421
- 2212

Sum of high numbers: 4417 + 4421 = 8838, 8838 + 2212 = 11050

Sum of low numbers: 1849 + 1850 = 3699;  
Add 2027: 3699 + 2027 = 5726

Total sum:

\[
11050\ (from high)\ +\ 5726\ (from low)\ =\boxed{16776}
\]

---

## **Final Answer**
The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number **2026** in this spiral is:
\[
\boxed{16776}
\]
