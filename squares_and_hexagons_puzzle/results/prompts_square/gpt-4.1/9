Let's analyze the spiral described:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

This is the standard **square spiral**, which starts at 1 in the center and spirals outward counterclockwise.

So the spiral (for clarity):

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|25 |10 |11 |12 |13 |
|24 | 9 | 2 | 3 |14 |
|23 | 8 | 1 | 4 |15 |
|22 | 7 | 6 | 5 |16 |
|21 |20 |19 |18 |17 |

We want to compute the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number **2026** in this spiral.

---

## Step 1: Find the position of 2026 on the spiral

First, let's recall how numbers are laid out in such a spiral.

- **Layer 0:** 1
- **Layer 1:** 2 to 9 (edge length = 3, numbers from 2 to 9)
- **Layer 2:** 10 to 25 (edge length = 5)
- **Layer n:** Numbers from \((2n-1)^2+1\) to \((2n+1)^2\), with edge length \(2n+1\)

#### The largest number in layer \(n\) is \( (2n+1)^2 \).

Let's find \(n\) such that \((2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2 \):

- Layer \(n\) has numbers up to \((2n+1)^2\)
- \((2n+1)^2 \geq 2026\)
- \(2n+1 \geq \sqrt{2026}\)
- \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.017\)

So \(2n+1 \geq 46\), \(n \geq 22.5\). So \(n = 23\).

Let’s confirm:

- \(2n+1 = 47\), so largest number is \(47^2 = 2209\)
- Previous layer \(2n-1 = 45\), so \(45^2 = 2025\)

- Layer 23 contains numbers from \(2026\) to \(2209\)

So \(2026\) is **the first number** in layer 23, at coordinate where the new layer starts, i.e., the "bottom right corner" of the spiral at layer 23.

---

## Step 2: Spiral coordinates

Let’s assign spiral coordinates: the starting position is (0,0) for 1.

Whenever you move outward to a new layer, you move right from the bottom right corner of the previous square, and will be at (layer, \(-layer\)).

Each time you complete a square, you're at a corner.

- The bottom right corner of layer \(n\) is at \((n, -n)\) and contains the number \((2n+1)^2\).
- The next number, as you increment, will be one above (vertical direction up), at \((n, -n+1)\), which should be \((2n+1)^2+1\).

Let's find the corners for layer 23 (\(n=23\)):
- Top right:         \((23, 23)\)        : \(2157\)
- Top left:          \((-23, 23)\)       : \(2093\)
- Bottom left:       \((-23, -23)\)      : \(2029\)
- Bottom right:      \((23, -23)\)       : \(2209\)

Wait, but normally the **completed square** is at \((n, -n)\). Let's check more systematic rules.

For standard Ulam spiral, the position rules are:

- \(n\)-th layer has outermost square with corner values at:

For layer \(n\), the 4 corners are:

- \( (2n+1)^2 \)  (bottom right)
- \( (2n+1)^2 - 2n \)  (bottom left)
- \( (2n+1)^2 - 4n \)  (top left)
- \( (2n+1)^2 - 6n \)  (top right)

So for \(n\):

- Bottom right: \((2n+1)^2\) at \((n, -n)\)
- Bottom left:  \((2n+1)^2 - 2n(1)\)
- Top left:     \((2n+1)^2 - 2n(2)\)
- Top right:    \((2n+1)^2 - 2n(3)\)

With that, for \(n=23\):

- Bottom right: \( (47)^2 = 2209 \)
- Bottom left:  \( 2209 - 46 = 2163 \)
- Top left:     \(2209 - 92 = 2117\)
- Top right:    \(2209 - 138 = 2071\)

So where is 2026? The first number in layer 23.

But that's not quite matching what we had, let's sort this out more carefully.

The maximum of layer \(n-1\) is \((2(n-1)+1)^2 = (2n-1)^2 = 2025\), so 2026 starts layer \(n=23\).

Now, the spiral is formed by starting at \((0,0)\) with 1, then moving right, up, left, down, and so on.

From formula: For outer layer \(n\), starting from number \(k = (2n-1)^2 + 1\)

- Go right: 1 step
- Up:    \(2n-1\) steps
- Left:  \(2n\) steps
- Down:  \(2n\) steps
- Right: \(2n\) steps

So, **starting at (n, -(n-1)), with value \((2n-1)^2+1\)**

For \(n=23\):

- Start at \((23, -22)\), number \(2026\)

Let's check the path for layer 23:

1. Start at \((23, -22)\), \(2026\)
2. Up: \(2027\) through \(2049\), positions \((23, -21)\) to \((23, 0)\)
3. Left: \(2050\) through \(2072\), positions \((22, 0)\) to \((0, 0)\)
4. Down: \(2073\) through \(2095\), positions \((0, -1)\) to \((0, -23)\)
5. Right: \(2096\) through \(2118\), positions \((1, -23)\) to \((23, -23)\)
   - Note: numbers keep increasing as you go counterclockwise around the box.

Let's explicitly write the steps:

- Start at \((23, -22)\): \(2026\)
- **Up:** \((23, -21)\): \(2027\), ..., \((23, 0): 2026 + 22 = 2048\), total 22 steps up (including the start, that’d be 23 numbers; yes, because from \(-22\) to 0).

But the count: from \((23, -22)\) to \((23, 0)\) is 22 steps.

Let’s make a table:

- Start:    \((23, -22)\) value: \(2026\)
- Up:      \( (23, y) \) for \( y = -21\) to \(0 \): values \(2027\) to \(2048\)
  - So at \((23, 0)\): \(2048\)
- Left:    \( (x, 0) \) for \( x = 22 \) to \( -23 \): values \(2049\) to \(2093\) (2093 at \((-23, 0)\))
- Down:    \( (-23, y) \) for \(y = -1\) to \(-23\): values \(2094\) to \(2116\) (\((-23, -23)\): \(2116\))
- Right:   \( (x, -23) \) for \(x = -22\) to \(23\): values \(2117\) to \(2209\), so \((23, -23)\) is \(2209\).

So, **the numbers in this outer layer at those positions.**

### Recap: position of \(2026\) is at \((23, -22)\).

Now, the neighbors are at positions:
- \((24, -22)\),
- \((22, -22)\),
- \((23, -21)\),
- \((23, -23)\),
- \((24, -21)\),
- \((24, -23)\),
- \((22, -21)\),
- \((22, -23)\)

Let's find the values at these positions.

---

## Step 3: Find the values for the 8 neighbors

From our path above, we can fill the values:

- **Up neighbor:** \((23, -21)\): \(2027\)
- **Down neighbor:** \((23, -23)\): Let's map this

### Path from \( (23, -22) \):

- \((23, -22)\): \(2026\)
- up to \((23, 0)\): up to \(2048\)
- left to \((-23, 0)\): up to \(2093\)
- down to \((-23, -23)\): up to \(2116\)
- right to \((23, -23)\): up to \(2209\)

Let's index neighbor positions one by one.

---

Let’s formalize, for any position \((x, y)\), how do we compute its value?

For the outermost layer (coordinates with \(\max(\lvert x \rvert, \lvert y \rvert) = n\)), the value at each stepped position can be calculated as follows.

- **If \(y = -n\), and \(x\) increases from \(-n+1\) to \(n\):** That's the bottom side.
- **If \(x = n\), and \(y\) increases from \(-n+1\) to \(n\):** That's the right side.
- **If \(y = n\), and \(x\) decreases from \(n-1\) to \(-n\):** That's the top side.
- **If \(x = -n\), and \(y\) decreases from \(n-1\) to \(-n\):** That’s the left side.

And the value at coordinate \((x, y)\) where \(\max(|x|, |y|)=n\) is:

- If on right edge (\(x=n\)), \(y>-n\):
  \[
  \text{Value} = (2n-1)^2 + (y+n) + 1
  \]
- If on top edge (\(y=n\)), \(x<n\):
  \[
  \text{Value} = (2n-1)^2 + (2n) + (n-x) + 1
  \]
- If on left edge (\(x=-n\)), \(y<n\):
  \[
  \text{Value} = (2n-1)^2 + (4n) + (n-y) + 1
  \]
- If on bottom edge (\(y=-n\)), \(x>-n\):
  \[
  \text{Value} = (2n-1)^2 + (6n) + (x+n) + 1
  \]

Let’s check for \((23,-22)\), \(n=23\):

- \(x=23\), \(y=-22\), so on the **right edge**.

\[
\text{Value} = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + (y + n) + 1 = (45)^2 + (-22 + 23) + 1 = 2025 + 1 + 1 = 2027
\]

Wait, that's one higher than 2026. But at \((23, -22)\), let's see:

- For x = n, right edge, y from -n+1 to n: so y = -22, n = 23, so -n+1 = -22, y = -22. So first position.
- For value: \((2n-1)^2 + (y+n) + 1\)
- \((45)^2 + ( -22+23) + 1 = 2025 + 1 + 1 = 2027\)
But in our previous schema, the first number at that layer is \(2026\), not \(2027\). So perhaps formula needs tweaking by -1.

Let’s check starting point:

- Outermost layer \(n\), maximum previous number is at square \(45^2 = 2025\).
- First position on right edge: x = n, y = -n+1, which corresponds to first number of new layer, which is 2026.

Thus, for \(x=n, y=-n + k\), \(k=1\) is starting point, so:

Value at \((n, -n + k)\) is \((2n-1)^2  + k\)

Thus:

- x = n, y = -n + k, value = \((2n-1)^2 + k\) for \(k=1\) to \(2n\)

So for \( (23,-22)\), \(k=1 \Rightarrow (45)^2 + 1 = 2026\) correct!

Similarly, next step up (y increases):

- (23,-21): k=2 -> value=2027

Thus, **neighbors**:

Let’s write all the 8:

1. \((24,-22)\): x > n? That is outside the current layer, so new layer n = 24.

   - \((x=n+1, y)\), so let’s find k:

     - For right edge, x = n+1, y = variable
     - For n = 24, previous max: (47)^2 = 2209
     - x=24, y=-22; right edge starts at (47)^2 + 1 = 2210, at (24, -23), then moves up.
     - y = -23 + k; y=-22 => k = 1; so value = 2210 + 1 = 2211

   But previous formula: value at \((n, -n + k)\) is \((2n-1)^2 + k\), \(k = 1 \ldots 2n\) for the layer.

   For outer layer:

   For n = 24:

   - previous maximum is (47)^2 = 2209
   - first number at (24, -23): 2210
   - (24, -22): k = 2, so 2209 + 2 = 2211

2. \((22,-22)\): x = 22 < 23, so at previous inner layer \(n=22\) if \(|y| \leq n\), but y=-22, x=22, so position on right edge of previous layer.

   For n = 22:

   - previous max: (43)^2 = 1849
   - first number at (22, -21): 1850
   - x=22, y=-22: is that in the edge?

   For right edge, x = n, y = -n + k, k=1 for rightmost.

   For y = -21, that's start, k=1: (22, -21), value = 1850

   For y=-22: is outside the layer (since layer is at |y| = n), but inner layer has points at x = 22, y = -22; that should be in.

   Wait, the positions at x = n, y = -n + k, k = 1 to 2n.

   For n = 22, values from y = -21 to y = 22.

   Wait, so y = -22 not covered.

   Need to generalize.

Alternatively, let's write explicitly:

For a given layer n, the positions (x, y) covered are:

- (x = n, y from -n+1 to n) **right edge** (goes up)
- (x from n-1 down to -n, y = n) **top edge** (goes left)
- (x = -n, y from n-1 down to -n) **left edge** (goes down)
- (x from -n+1 to n-1, y = -n) **bottom edge** (goes right)

But for (22,-22), x=22, y=-22; at n=22, x=22, y=-21 to 22; y=-22 not on right edge, and x=22 on bottom edge if y=-22.

But y=-n, x from -n+1 to n-1: so n=22, y=-22, x from -21 to 21. So (22,-22) is outside the core. It's on layer n=23.

But for n=23, x varies from -22 to 23 on y = -23.

But (22,-22) is in the layer n=23, but not on the edge.

It seems positions like (22,-22) are on the diagonal just inside the outermost layer.

Alternatively, perhaps let's relate all 8 positions of (23,-22):

- (23,-22) -- center (number 2026)
- (24,-22) -- outside (outer layer, we'll find its value)
- (22,-22) -- inside (layer n=22, let's confirm)
- (23,-21) -- up (on outer edge)
- (23,-23) -- down (on outer edge)
- (24,-21), (24,-23) -- outside
- (22,-21), (22,-23) -- inside or diagonal

Maybe it's better to write code, but since we can't, let's try to generalize.

### Let's find the numbers of all 8 neighbors:

1. **(24, -22):**  outer layer (n=24), right edge, y = -22

    - For n = 24, previous max = (47)^2 = 2209
    - Right edge: x = 24, y = -23 + k, k = 1 to 48
    - For y = -22: k = 2 → 2209 + 2 = **2211**

2. **(22, -22):** inner layer (n=22), bottom edge, y = -22, x varies from -21 to 21, but x=22 not included, so (22, -22) must be layer n=23, not inner layer.

    But for n=23, y = -22, x from -22 to 23, which includes x=22.

    So for layer 23, bottom edge: y = -23, x from -22 to 22. Here, y=-22, not matching.

    But perhaps let's revert to 9x9 spiral to see a pattern:

    Let's look at a smaller spiral for reference.

    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |37 |36 |35 |34 |33 |32 |31 | 
    |38 |17 |16 |15 |14 |13 |30 |
    |39 |18 | 5 | 4 | 3 |12 |29 |
    |40 |19 | 6 | 1 | 2 |11 |28 |
    |41 |20 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |27 |
    |42 |21 |22 |23 |24 |25 |26 |
    |43 |44 |45 |46 |47 |48 |49 |

    Pick a number at, say, position (3, -2), and look at the neighbor positions.

    But we see that each position is part of its own layer, and the 8 neighbors will be spread across 3 possible layers: outer (layer+1), inner (layer-1), and the same layer.

    Thus, let's use the formula for value at position (x,y):

    If at (x, y), find n = max(|x|, |y|).

    For 4 edges:
- **If x = n (right edge), y in [-n+1, n]:**
    \[
    \text{value} = (2n-1)^2 + (y+n)
    \]
- **If y = n (top edge), x in [n-1, -n]:**
    \[
    \text{value} = (2n-1)^2 + 2n + (n-x)
    \]
- **If x = -n (left edge), y in [n-1, -n]:**
    \[
    \text{value} = (2n-1)^2 + 4n + (n-y)
    \]
- **If y = -n (bottom edge), x in [-n+1, n]:**
    \[
    \text{value} = (2n-1)^2 + 6n + (x+n)
    \]

Now, for (23,-22), n = 23, x=23, y=-22: right edge, so value = (2*23-1)^2 + (y+n) = 2025 + 1 = 2026, as before.

Now, for each neighbor:

### 1. (24, -22): x=24, y=-22, n=24; right edge of n=24

  So, value = (2*24-1)^2 + (y + n) = (47)^2 + ( -22 + 24 ) = 2209 + 2 = **2211**

### 2. (22, -22): x=22, y=-22, n=22; right edge of n=22

  value = (2*22-1)^2 + ( y + n ) = (43)^2 + ( -22 + 22 ) = 1849 + 0 = **1849**

### 3. (23, -21): x=23, y=-21, n=23; right edge, value: (2025) + ( -21 + 23) = 2025 + 2 = **2027**

### 4. (23, -23): x=23, y=-23, n=23; right edge, (2025) + ( -23 + 23 ) = 2025 + 0 = **2025**

### 5. (24, -21): x=24, y=-21, n=24; right edge, (2209) + ( -21 + 24 ) = 2209 + 3 = **2212**

### 6. (24, -23): x=24, y=-23, n=24; right edge, (2209) + ( -23 + 24 ) = 2209 + 1 = **2210**

### 7. (22, -21): x=22, y=-21, n=22; right edge, (1849) + ( -21 + 22 ) = 1849 + 1 = **1850**

### 8. (22, -23): x=22, y=-23, n=23; bottom edge, so
 y = -n = -23, x in [-22, 22]:
 value = (2025) + 6*23 + (x + 23) = 2025 + 138 + (x + 23)
 For x=22, (2025) + 138 + 45 = 2025 + 183 = **2208**

---

Let’s double-check:

For (22, -23): x=22, y=-23, n=23, bottom edge, so formula:

(2n-1)^2 + 6n + (x + n) = 2025 + 138 + (22 + 23) = 2025 + 138 + 45 = 2208

---

## Step 4: Sum up all neighbor values

Neighbors:

1. (24, -22):   2211
2. (22, -22):   1849
3. (23, -21):   2027
4. (23, -23):   2025
5. (24, -21):   2212
6. (24, -23):   2210
7. (22, -21):   1850
8. (22, -23):   2208

Sum:

Let’s add:

First, group similar-sized numbers for easier addition.

- 2211
- 2212
- 2210
- 2208

Sum of these four: \(2211 + 2212 = 4423; 2210 + 2208 = 4418; 4423 + 4418 = 8841\)

Then the smaller group:

- 1849
- 1850
- 2025
- 2027

1849 + 1850 = 3699; 2025 + 2027 = 4052; 3699 + 4052 = 7751

Now, sum both results:

8841 + 7751 =  **16592**

---

### **Final Answer**:

\[
\boxed{16592}
\]

is the **sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026** in the described spiral.
