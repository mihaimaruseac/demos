We will show that when the positive integers are “snaked” around a grid as in

  … 5 4 3 …
  … 6 1 2 …
  … 7 8 9 …

it is possible to “read off” a formula so that, for example, you can determine which number is written at any lattice point and then “sum the eight surrounding” numbers. (In our answer “neighbors” means the 8 positions immediately adjacent in the grid: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.)

In this solution we will explain one way of “labeling” the spiral and then use it to locate the number 2026 and its eight neighbors, and finally add them up.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Setting up the spiral and coordinates

It is natural to put 1 at the center, at coordinate (0,0). In our picture the “up‐direction” corresponds to increasing y and “right‐direction” to increasing x. (You may check that the diagram

      … 5 4 3 …
      … 6 1 2 …
      … 7 8 9 …

gets the following coordinates:
  1 is at (0,0)
  2 is at (1,0)
  3 is at (1,1)
  4 is at (0,1)
  5 is at (–1,1)
  6 is at (–1,0)
  7 is at (–1,–1)
  8 is at (0,–1)
  9 is at (1,–1).)

Once the center is fixed the spiral is built “ring‐by‐ring.” In our spiral the “first ring” (or layer) is the 8 numbers 2,…,9 which lie around 1. (As one may check, the 8 numbers are placed consecutively as one “circles” the center.) In general the n‑th “ring” (n ≥ 1) will contain 8n numbers. (For example, the second ring has 16 numbers, the third 24, etc.)

A useful fact is that the largest number written in the n‑th ring is (2n + 1)²; for example, in the first ring the maximum is 3² = 9 while in the second ring the maximum is 5² = 25.

In our spiral the construction is as follows. Start with 1 at (0,0). Then:
 • Move one step to the right to write 2 at (1,0). (This “starting cell” of the first ring is our “base point” for ring 1.)
 • Then go upward 1 step to place 3 at (1,1).
 • Next go left 2 steps (filling in 4 and 5).
 • Then down 2 steps (6 and 7).
 • Then right 2 steps (8 and 9).

For later rings the pattern is similar. For example, after finishing ring 1 the next cell is obtained by moving one step right from the last number (9 at (1,–1)) so that 10 goes to (2,–1). Then one “circles” the new ring in four stages:
 1. Up for 2n steps (in fact, exactly 2n – 1 steps after starting, so that the “right edge” of ring n ends at (n, n)),
 2. Left 2n steps,
 3. Down 2n steps, and
 4. Right 2n steps.
One may show that for ring n (n ≥ 1) the first number of the ring is 
  S(n) = (2n – 1)² + 1,
and its “starting coordinate” is 
  (n, –(n – 1)).
For example, for ring 1 we have S(1) = (1)² + 1 = 2 (at (1,0)) and for ring 2 S(2) = 3² + 1 = 10 (at (2,–1)).

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. A “coordinate–formula” for the outer ring

A standard way (after a little thought) to “parameterize” the numbers on a given outer ring (i.e. where the “radius” n = max(|x|,|y|) is fixed) is as follows. (Below “ring n” really means the ring corresponding to n ≥ 1.)

For a point (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|) = n, there is a convenient formula if the point lies on one of the four “sides” of the square:
 • Right edge: points with x = n and y running from –(n – 1) up to n.
  Number = S(n) + (y + n – 1).
 • Top edge: points with y = n and x running from n down to –n.
  Number = S(n) + [(2n – 1) + (n – x)].
 • Left edge: points with x = –n and y running from n down to –n.
  Number = S(n) + [(2n – 1) + 2n + (n – y)].
 • Bottom edge: points with y = –n and x running from –n up to n.
  Number = S(n) + [(2n – 1) + 2n + 2n + (x + n)].
It is a good exercise to check (for n = 1, 2, 3) that these formulas yield the correct numbers.

For example, for ring 3 we have S(3) = (2·3 – 1)² + 1 = 5² + 1 = 26. Then the number at (3,3) (on the right–edge end of the “up” segment) would be 26 + (3 + 3 – 1) = 26 + 5 = 31, and one may check that indeed 31 is written at (3,3).

Also, one may show that the maximum number on ring n is
  (2n + 1)²,
which is obtained at the point (n, –n) (on the bottom edge).

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. Locating the number 2026

Because the maximum number in ring n is (2n + 1)², notice that
  45² = 2025 < 2026 < 47² = 2209.
Thus 2026 is the very first number in the ring whose maximum is 47²; that is, it lies in the ring corresponding to n = 24? 
Be careful: In our “ring–by–ring” numbering, ring 1 covers numbers 2–9 (max = 9 = 3²), ring 2 covers numbers 10–25 (max = 25 = 5²), ring 3 covers 26–49 (max = 49 = 7²), etc. In general, the ring that has maximum (2n + 1)² is the one with n (as defined in the formula above) equal to an odd number’s half–integer. (More conveniently, one may “index” ring by k where k = n; then the maximum on ring k is (2k + 1)².) 

Since 45² = 2025 is the maximum in the previous ring (with k = 22, because 2·22 + 1 = 45) it follows that 2026 is the first number in the next ring. (Sometimes you may see people “label” the rings starting at k = 0 for the center; here we are using k ≥ 1 for the “first ring”.) In our formulas the first number of ring k is 
  S(k) = (2k – 1)² + 1.
We have 2026 = (45)² + 1, so here k must be 23 because (2·23 – 1) = 45. (That is, in our numbering the “outer radius” is n = 23.) Its “starting coordinate” is then
  (23, –(23 – 1)) = (23, –22).
Thus 2026 is at (23, –22) and is the first number on ring 23.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 4. Finding the eight neighbors of 2026

The eight neighbors of the cell (23, –22) (where 2026 lies) are at these coordinates:
 1. (22, –23)
 2. (23, –23)
 3. (24, –23)
 4. (22, –22)
 5. (24, –22)
 6. (22, –21)
 7. (23, –21)
 8. (24, –21)

Some of these neighbors are on the same ring as 2026 while others lie in different rings. (Recall that if a point (x,y) has max(|x|,|y|) = m then it lies in ring m. For example, (22,–22) has max(|22|,|–22|) = 22 so it is one of the inner cells compared to the cell (23,–22) in ring 23; on the other hand, any coordinate with an x‐ or y–value of 24 lies in ring 24.)

Let’s compute the number written in each neighbor using the formulas above.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor A. (22, –23)

Here max(|22|,|–23|) = 23 so it lies in ring 23.
It lies on the bottom edge (since y = –23 and for ring 23 the bottom edge is y = –23).
For the bottom edge (for ring n) the formula is:
 Number = S(n) + [ (2n – 1) + 2n + 2n + (x + n) ].
For n = 23, note that
 S(23) = (2·23 – 1)² + 1 = 45² + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026,
and
 (2n – 1) + 2n + 2n = (45) + 46 + 46 = 137.
Since x = 22, we have x + n = 22 + 23 = 45.
Thus the number is
 2026 + 137 + 45 = 2026 + 182 = 2208.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor B. (23, –23)

Still in ring 23 on the bottom edge. Now x = 23 so x + 23 = 46.
Thus the number is
 2026 + 137 + 46 = 2026 + 183 = 2209.
This is the maximum number on ring 23.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor C. (24, –23)

Here max(|24|,|–23|) = 24 so it lies in ring 24.
For ring 24 the first number is
 S(24) = (2·24 – 1)² + 1 = 47² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
Notice that the “starting coordinate” of ring 24 is (24, –(24 – 1)) = (24, –23).
Thus (24, –23) holds the number 2210.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor D. (22, –22)

Here max(|22|,|–22|) = 22 so the cell is in ring 22.
For ring 22,
 S(22) = (2·22 – 1)² + 1 = (43)² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850.
The coordinate (22, –22) lies on the bottom edge of ring 22 (because y = –22 for ring 22).
On the bottom edge the number is:
 Number = S(22) + [ (2·22 – 1) + 2·22 + 2·22 + (x + 22) ].
Here (2·22 – 1) = 43, and 2·22 = 44 so the sum of the three segments is 43 + 44 + 44 = 131.
Since x = 22, we have 22 + 22 = 44.
Thus the number is
 1850 + 131 + 44 = 1850 + 175 = 2025.
(Indeed, 2025 = 45² is the maximum of ring 22.)

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor E. (24, –22)

Here max(|24|,|–22|) = 24 so the cell is in ring 24.
Notice that (24, –22) has x = 24.
When x = 24 the cell is on the right edge (since on ring 24 the right–edge cells have x = 24 and y between –(24 – 1) = –23 and 24).
The formula for a right–edge cell is:
 Number = S(24) + (y + 24 – 1).
Here S(24) = 2210 and y = –22 so:
 y + 24 – 1 = –22 + 23 = 1.
Thus the number is 2210 + 1 = 2211.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor F. (22, –21)

Here max(|22|,|–21|) = 22 so we are in ring 22.
Consider (22, –21). For ring 22, the “starting coordinate” is (22, –(22 – 1)) = (22, –21).
Thus (22, –21) is S(22) = 1850.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor G. (23, –21)

Now max(|23|,|–21|) = 23 so the cell is in ring 23.
Since x = 23, the cell is on the right edge. Its formula is:
 Number = S(23) + (y + 23 – 1).
Here S(23) = 2026 and y = –21 so the offset is (–21 + 22) = 1.
Thus the number is 2026 + 1 = 2027.

–––––––––––––––
Neighbor H. (24, –21)

Here max(|24|,|–21|) = 24 so it is in ring 24.
Again, (24, –21) is on the right edge. The formula gives:
 Number = S(24) + (y + 24 – 1).
With S(24) = 2210 and y = –21 we get: –21 + 23 = 2.
So the number is 2210 + 2 = 2212.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 5. Summing the neighbors

Now we have found the eight neighbors:
 (22, –23) → 2208
 (23, –23) → 2209
 (24, –23) → 2210
 (22, –22) → 2025
 (24, –22) → 2211
 (22, –21) → 1850
 (23, –21) → 2027
 (24, –21) → 2212

Add these values:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417
 4417 + 2210 = 6627
 6627 + 2025 = 8652
 8652 + 2211 = 10863
 10863 + 1850 = 12713
 12713 + 2027 = 14740
 14740 + 2212 = 16952

───────────────────────────── 
Answer

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is 16,952.
