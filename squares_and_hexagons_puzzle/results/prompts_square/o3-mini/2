We will show that if the numbers 1, 2, 3, … are “spiraled” onto a square grid so that

    5 4 3
    6 1 2
    7 8 9

(with 1 at the center and “moving” in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, … as shown) then the eight numbers immediately surrounding 2026 add up to 16,952.

In what follows we describe one way to attack the problem.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. The “Spiral Coordinates”

It is natural to place 1 at the origin (0, 0) and “draw” the spiral with the familiar pattern (when read from top‐to‐bottom the rows give the display above). For example, one may assign coordinates as follows:

  • 1 is at (0, 0).
  • 2 is to the right at (1, 0).
  • 3 is “above” 2 at (1, 1).
  • 4 is to the left of 3: (0, 1).
  • 5 is at (–1, 1).
  • 6 is directly below 5: (–1, 0).
  • 7 is at (–1, –1).
  • 8 is at (0, –1).
  • 9 is at (1, –1).

Then the printed grid (with the top row being y = 1 and the bottom y = –1) reads

  Row y = 1:   5 4 3
  Row y = 0:   6 1 2
  Row y = –1:  7 8 9

This is the standard “Ulam spiral” (with the usual 90° rotation in the printed array).

A well‐known fact is that the spiral is “layered.” The center is layer 0; the next “ring” (all numbers from 2 to 9) is layer 1; then numbers 10 to 25 form layer 2; etc. In fact, if we set
  r = max{|x|, |y|},
then the layer with “radius” r has side–length m = 2r + 1 and its largest number is m².

In our spiral the numbers along the boundary (of a given layer) can be described as follows. For r ≥ 1 let
  m = 2r + 1 and M = m².
Then one finds by “tracing” the spiral that:
  • M appears at (r, –r) (the “bottom‐right” corner).
  • Along the bottom edge (y = –r) the points have coordinates (r – t, –r) with t from 0 to 2r and number M – t.
  • Along the left edge (x = –r) the points are (–r, –r + t) for t from 0 to 2r and hold the numbers M – 2r – t.
  • Along the top edge (y = r) the points (–r + t, r) with t from 0 to 2r hold the numbers M – 4r – t.
  • Along the right edge (x = r) the points (r, r – t) (with 0 ≤ t ≤ 2r) carry the numbers M – 6r – t.

For example, take r = 1: then m = 3 and M = 9. The right edge (x = 1) gives t = 0 : (1, 1) should get 9 – 6 – 0 = 3; indeed 3 is at (1, 1). Similarly, one checks the other edges.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Locate 2026 in the Spiral

We first find the layer containing 2026. In layer r the largest number is (2r + 1)². We need r such that

  (2r – 1)² < 2026 ≤ (2r + 1)².

Notice that 45² = 2025 and 45 is odd. Since 2026 > 2025, 2026 lies not in the “45–sized” (r = 22) square but in the next one. For r = 23 we have
  m = 2·23 + 1 = 47 and M = 47² = 2209.
Then the “offset”
  d = M – 2026 = 2209 – 2026 = 183.
Also, the side–length (not in grid cells but the “edge length minus 1”) is 2r = 46.

We now decide which edge of layer 23 the number 2026 lies on. The four segments have lengths 46 each:
  • Segment 1 (bottom edge): 0 ≤ d ≤ 46. (Not so because 183 > 46.)
  • Segment 2 (left edge): 46 ≤ d ≤ 92. (183 > 92.)
  • Segment 3 (top edge): 92 ≤ d ≤ 138. (183 > 138.)
  • Segment 4 (right edge): 138 ≤ d ≤ 184.

Since 183 lies in the fourth segment, we are on the right edge. There the coordinates are given by:
  (x, y) = (r, r – (d – 6r)).
With r = 23 and 6r = 138, we have:
  y = 23 – (183 – 138) = 23 – 45 = –22,
and x = 23.
Thus the number 2026 is at (23, –22).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

Its eight neighbors (using “king’s moves”) are the points around (23, –22):
  (22, –23), (23, –23), (24, –23),
  (22, –22),           (24, –22),
  (22, –21), (23, –21), (24, –21).

For each neighbor we must “read off” the number written there. (Note that some neighbors lie in the same layer as 2026, namely layer r = 23, while others lie in the immediately inner layer (r = 22) or outer layer (r = 24).) To do so, we use the “inverse” of the rule above. Namely, if a neighbor (x, y) lies in layer r (where r = max{|x|, |y|}), then m = 2r + 1 and the maximum in that layer is M = m². Depending on which edge the point lies on its number is given by:
  • If y = –r (bottom edge): 
    t = r – x  and number = M – t.
  • If x = –r (left edge):
    t = y + r  and number = M – 2r – t.
  • If y = r (top edge):
    t = x + r  and number = M – 4r – t.
  • If x = r (right edge):
    t = r – y  and number = M – 6r – t.

Let’s determine the neighbor value for each:

1. Neighbor (22, –23):
  r = max(|22|, |–23|) = 23, so m = 47 and M = 2209.
  • Since y = –23 = –r (bottom edge), t = 23 – 22 = 1.
  Thus, value = 2209 – 1 = 2208.

2. Neighbor (23, –23):
  r = 23, m = 47, M = 2209.
  • Here (23, –23) is the bottom–right corner (y = –23, x = 23). For the bottom edge, t = 23 – 23 = 0.
  Thus, value = 2209 – 0 = 2209.

3. Neighbor (24, –23):
  r = max(|24|, |–23|) = 24, so m = 2·24 + 1 = 49 and M = 49² = 2401.
  • Since x = 24 equals r, we are on the right edge. Then t = r – y = 24 – (–23) = 47.
  Thus, value = 2401 – 6·24 – 47. (Note 6·24 = 144.)
  So, value = 2401 – 144 – 47 = 2401 – 191 = 2210.

4. Neighbor (22, –22):
  r = max(|22|, |–22|) = 22, so m = 45 and M = 45² = 2025.
  • (22, –22) is the bottom–right corner of layer 22 (since y = –22 and x = 22). On the bottom edge, t = 22 – 22 = 0.
  Thus, value = 2025 – 0 = 2025.

5. Neighbor (24, –22):
  r = max(|24|, |–22|) = 24, so m = 49, M = 2401.
  • Since x = 24 (right edge), t = 24 – (–22) = 46.
  Thus, value = 2401 – 144 – 46 = 2401 – 190 = 2211.

6. Neighbor (22, –21):
  r = max(|22|, |–21|) = 22, so m = 45, M = 2025.
  Now, (22, –21) is on the right edge of layer 22 because x = 22.
  • Then t = r – y = 22 – (–21) = 43.
  Thus, value = 2025 – 6·22 – 43. (6·22 = 132.)
  So, value = 2025 – 132 – 43 = 2025 – 175 = 1850.

7. Neighbor (23, –21):
  r = max(|23|, |–21|) = 23, so m = 47, M = 2209.
  (23, –21) lies on the right edge (x = 23).
  • Then t = 23 – (–21) = 44.
  Thus, value = 2209 – 6·23 – 44. (6·23 = 138.)
  So, value = 2209 – 138 – 44 = 2209 – 182 = 2027.

8. Neighbor (24, –21):
  r = max(|24|, |–21|) = 24, so m = 49, M = 2401.
  Again on the right edge (x = 24):
  • t = 24 – (–21) = 45.
  Thus, value = 2401 – 144 – 45 = 2401 – 189 = 2212.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Sum the Neighbors

Now we add the eight neighbor values:

  2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212.

One way to add is to group them:
  Group the “layer 23 and 24” values:
   2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 2208 + 2209 = 4417; 
   4417 + 2210 = 6627;
   6627 + 2211 = 8838;
   8838 + 2212 = 11050.
  And the “layer 22 and 23” ones:
   2025 + 2027 + 1850 = (2025 + 2027)  = 4052; 4052 + 1850 = 5902.
Then the total sum is
  11050 + 5902 = 16952.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The sum of the eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is 16,952.

Thus, the answer is 16952.
