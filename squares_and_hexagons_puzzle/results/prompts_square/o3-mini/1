We wish to know the sum of the “8–neighbors” (vertically, horizontally, and diagonally adjacent cells) of the cell that contains the number 2026 when the natural numbers are laid in a spiral as shown:

  … 5 4 3 …  
  … 6 1 2 …  
  … 7 8 9 …

A convenient way to think about the spiral is to set up an (x,y) coordinate system with 1 at the origin (0,0). (You may choose “up” as increasing y and “right” as increasing x.) Then the numbers are placed in a spiral that starts at 1 and “winds outward” counter‐clockwise. For example, from the picture we have:
  • (0,0) = 1  
  • (1,0) = 2  
  • (1,1) = 3  
  • (0,1) = 4  
  • (–1,1) = 5  
  • (–1,0) = 6  
  • (–1,–1) = 7  
  • (0,–1) = 8  
  • (1,–1) = 9

A well‐known way to “label” a number’s position in this spiral is to identify its “ring.” For any cell with coordinates (x,y) let k = max(|x|, |y|). (The “ring” with k = 0 is just the center.) One may prove that the largest number in ring k is M = (2k+1)² and that M sits at the bottom–right corner, i.e. at (k, –k).

Moreover, one may show that the numbers in ring k (with k ≥ 1) run consecutively along the four “edges” of the square. A useful formula is as follows. For a given cell (x,y) with k = max(|x|, |y|), define

  S = (2k–1)² + 1

so that S is the first number of ring k. Then one may verify that:

1. If the cell is on the right edge (x = k) and y runs from –k+1 up to k, then
  number = S + (y + k – 1).
2. If the cell is on the top edge (y = k) and x runs from k–1 down to –k, then
  number = S + (2k – 1) + (k – x).
3. If the cell is on the left edge (x = –k) and y runs from k–1 down to –k), then
  number = S + (4k – 1) + (k – y).
4. If the cell is on the bottom edge (y = –k) and x runs from –k+1 to k), then
  number = S + (6k – 1) + (x + k).

Let’s now determine the location and numbers of the cells around 2026.

Step 1. Locate 2026 in the Spiral

For our spiral the “start” of each ring is given by
  ring k: numbers from (2k–1)² + 1 up to (2k+1)².
Notice that 45² = 2025. Thus 2025 is the last number in ring k = 22. So the very next number, 2026, is the first number in ring k = 23.

For ring 23 the formula gives
  S = (2·23 – 1)² + 1 = 45² + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026.
A look at the construction shows that the first number in a ring is placed one cell to the right of the bottom–right corner of the previous ring. In our coordinates one may show that it lies at
  (23, –(23–1)) = (23, –22).
Thus, 2026 occupies the cell (23, –22).

Step 2. Identify the 8 Neighbors of (23, –22)

The 8 neighbor coordinates (accounting for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors) are:
  A: (22, –23)
  B: (23, –23)
  C: (24, –23)
  D: (22, –22)
  E: (24, –22)
  F: (22, –21)
  G: (23, –21)
  H: (24, –21)

For each neighbor we must determine which “ring” it lies in (by computing k = max(|x|, |y|)) and then use the appropriate formula.

• Neighbor A: (22, –23)
 – |22| = 22, |–23| = 23 so k = 23.
 – Since y = –23 = –k, we use case 4.
  S for k = 23 is 2026.
  number = S + (6·23 – 1) + (x + 23)
  = 2026 + (138 – 1) + (22 + 23)
  = 2026 + 137 + 45 = 2026 + 182 = 2208.

• Neighbor B: (23, –23)
 – Here |23| = 23, so k = 23 and (23, –23) is the bottom–right corner.
 – Using case 4:
  number = 2026 + (6·23 – 1) + (23 + 23)
  = 2026 + 137 + 46 = 2026 + 183 = 2209.
  (Indeed, 2209 = (2·23+1)² is the maximum number in ring 23.)

• Neighbor C: (24, –23)
 – |24| = 24 and |–23| = 23 so k = 24.
 – For k = 24, compute S = (2·24 – 1)² + 1 = (47)² + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
 – In (24, –23) we have x = 24 = k and y = –23.
  Use case 1:
  number = S + (y + k – 1) = 2210 + (–23 + 24 – 1) = 2210 + 0 = 2210.

• Neighbor D: (22, –22)
 – |22| = 22 so k = 22.
 – For k = 22, S = (2·22 – 1)² + 1 = (43)² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850.
 – (22, –22) has x = 22 = k and y = –22 = –k, the bottom–right corner of ring 22.
  Use case 4:
  number = 1850 + (6·22 – 1) + (22 + 22)
  = 1850 + (132 – 1) + 44 = 1850 + 131 + 44 = 1850 + 175 = 2025.
  (This is expected since 2025 is the maximum of ring 22.)

• Neighbor E: (24, –22)
 – |24| = 24 so k = 24 with S = 2210.
 – (24, –22) has x = 24 = k.
  Use case 1:
  number = 2210 + (–22 + 24 – 1) = 2210 + (1) = 2211.

• Neighbor F: (22, –21)
 – max(|22|,|–21|) = 22 so k = 22 and S = 1850.
 – (22, –21) has x = 22 = k and y = –21.
  On the right edge for ring 22 (which runs for y from –(22–1)= –21 up to 22):
  number = S + (y + k – 1) = 1850 + (–21 + 22 – 1) = 1850 + 0 = 1850.
  (Indeed, for ring 22 the first number S = 1850 is at (22, –21).)

• Neighbor G: (23, –21)
 – |23| = 23 so k = 23 and S = 2026.
 – (23, –21) has x = 23 = k.
  Use case 1:
  number = 2026 + (y + 23 – 1) = 2026 + (–21 + 22) = 2026 + 1 = 2027.

• Neighbor H: (24, –21)
 – Here |24| = 24 so k = 24 with S = 2210.
 – (24, –21) has x = 24 = k.
  Use case 1:
  number = 2210 + (y + 24 – 1) = 2210 + (–21 + 23) = 2210 + 2 = 2212.

Step 3. Sum the 8 Neighbors

Now we have:
 A: 2208  
 B: 2209  
 C: 2210  
 D: 2025  
 E: 2211  
 F: 1850  
 G: 2027  
 H: 2212  

Let’s add them:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952  

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,952.

Final Answer: 16952.
