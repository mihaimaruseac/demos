We wish to find the sum of the eight numbers that “touch” 2026 in the Ulam spiral. (Recall that in this spiral the “neighbors” of a number are all those numbers that are immediately adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.) In our spiral the numbers are laid out in such a way that

   … 5 4 3 …  
   … 6 1 2 …  
   … 7 8 9 …  

and, more generally, the spiral “rings” around 1. (For example, 2 is to the right of 1, 3 is above 2, 4 is to the left of 3, etc.)  

The problem has two ingredients:
 1. Find (by “locating”) the number 2026 on the spiral (that is, determine its coordinates).
 2. Determine, from a formula that assigns a number to any coordinate, the numbers in each of the eight neighboring positions and add them.

In what follows we explain one way to do this.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Finding the “ring” and Coordinates for 2026

One standard way to assign coordinates is to let 1 be at (0,0) and “grow” the spiral outward. In the spiral we have:
  1 at (0,0)
  2 at (1,0)
  3 at (1,1)
  4 at (0,1)
  5 at (–1,1)
  6 at (–1,0)
  7 at (–1,–1)
  8 at (0,–1)
  9 at (1,–1)

A useful fact is that for k ≥ 1 the “ring” with radius k (that is, the set of points with max{|x|,|y|} = k) has its largest number 
  M = (2k+1)²
which is located at (k, –k) and the previous numbers “wind” counterclockwise around.

To decide in which ring 2026 lies, note that:
 • The previous ring (k = 22) has maximum (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.
 • The next ring (k = 23) has maximum (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209.

Since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, the number 2026 lies in the k = 23 ring.

Define
  M = (2k+1)² = 47² = 2209.
Also, let
  d = M − n.
For n = 2026 we get:
  d = 2209 − 2026 = 183.

The “leg length” along each side of the square ring is 2k = 46. (For example, in the first ring k = 1 the side has 2 units between the corners.)

A very nice way to “walk back” from M to n is to note that the numbers run continuously along the four sides. In our setup (which fits the arrangement in the diagram) an elementary analysis shows that one may use the following formulas for a number in ring k (with k ≥ 1). If we let r = k and define d = M – n, then

  • If 0 ≤ d < 2k then
   (x, y) = (  r – d, –r ).
  • If 2k ≤ d < 4k then (after breaking the interval into two equal parts)
   – For 2k ≤ d < 4k, one may write
    if 2k ≤ d < 3k: (x, y) = (–r, –r + (d – 2k)).
    if 3k ≤ d < 4k: (x, y) = ( –r + (d – 3k), r ).

(It is not hard to verify that these formulas give the correct positions in the “first ring”.)

For our purpose (k = 23, leg = 46) observe that 
  3·46 = 138  and  4·46 = 184.
Since 138 ≤ d = 183 < 184, 2026 falls on the “fourth side.” More precisely, the formula in our version (which works very well for the arrangement in our diagram) is

  If 3·(2k) ≤ d < 4·(2k) then
   (x, y) = ( r, r – (d – 3·(2k)) ).

Here r = 23 and 2k = 46. Compute:
  d – 3·46 = 183 − 138 = 45.
Thus the coordinates for 2026 are
  (23, 23 − 45) = (23, –22).

You can check that with our coordinate convention 2026 is indeed “to the right” of center (x positive) and “a bit below” the horizontal axis (y negative).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Finding the Neighbors and Their Values

The eight neighbors of a number at (x, y) are the numbers at positions:
  (x–1, y–1), (x, y–1), (x+1, y–1),
  (x–1, y  ),           (x+1, y  ),
  (x–1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1).

For 2026 at (23, –22) these neighbors are:
 A: (22, –23)
 B: (23, –23)
 C: (24, –23)
 D: (22, –22)
 E: (24, –22)
 F: (22, –21)
 G: (23, –21)
 H: (24, –21)

To “read off” the value at any coordinate we use a well‐known formula for the Ulam spiral. For any coordinate (x, y) with center (0,0) first let
  r = max{|x|, |y|}.
Then (2r+1)² is the maximum in that ring. (One can check that our spiral has its maximum at positions where y = –r.) One may show that a good formula is as follows. (When a coordinate lies on a “corner” it satisfies two conditions; in that case use the rule for which y = –r holds.)
  • If y = –r then the number at (x, y) is
    N = (2r+1)² − (r − x).
  • Otherwise, if x = r then
    N = (2r+1)² − 6r − (r − y).
  • Otherwise, if x = –r then
    N = (2r+1)² − 2r − (r + y).
  • Otherwise, if y = r then
    N = (2r+1)² − 4r − (r + x).

It is good to test this on a few known coordinates. For example, (1, –1) is a corner in the first ring. Here r = 1 and since y = –1 = –r, the formula gives
  N = 9 − (1 – 1) = 9,
which correctly corresponds to the number 9 in our spiral.

Now we use the formula for each neighbor.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor A: (22, –23)
 r = max(|22|, |–23|) = 23.
Since –23 equals –23 (i.e. y = –r), we use:
  N = (2·23+1)² – (23 – 22) = 47² – 1 = 2209 – 1 = 2208.

Neighbor B: (23, –23)
 r = 23, and here y = –23 = –r.
  N = 2209 – (23 – 23) = 2209.

Neighbor C: (24, –23)
 r = max(24, 23) = 24.
Now y = –23 is not equal to –24, but x = 24 equals r so we use the “x = r” branch:
  N = (2·24+1)² – 6·24 – (24 – (–23)).
  (2·24+1)² = 49² = 2401.
  6·24 = 144 and 24 – (–23) = 47.
  Thus, N = 2401 − 144 − 47 = 2401 − 191 = 2210.

Neighbor D: (22, –22)
 r = max(22, 22) = 22.
Here y = –22 equals –22 (since –r = –22), so
  N = (2·22+1)² – (22 – 22) = 45² – 0 = 2025.

Neighbor E: (24, –22)
 r = max(24, 22) = 24.
Here x = 24 = r (and note y ≠ –24), so
  N = 2401 − 6·24 − (24 – (–22)).
  6·24 = 144 and 24 – (–22) = 46.
  Thus, N = 2401 − 144 − 46 = 2401 − 190 = 2211.

Neighbor F: (22, –21)
 r = max(22, 21) = 22.
Here x = 22 = r (and y is not –22), so we use:
  N = (2·22+1)² − 6·22 − (22 – (–21)).
  (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.
  6·22 = 132 and (22 – (–21)) = 43.
  Thus, N = 2025 − 132 − 43 = 2025 − 175 = 1850.

Neighbor G: (23, –21)
 r = max(23, 21) = 23.
Here x = 23 = r so
  N = 2209 − 6·23 − (23 – (–21)).
  6·23 = 138 and 23 – (–21) = 44.
  Thus, N = 2209 − 138 − 44 = 2209 − 182 = 2027.

Neighbor H: (24, –21)
 r = max(24, 21) = 24.
Here x = 24 = r so
  N = 2401 − 6·24 − (24 – (–21)).
  6·24 = 144 and 24 – (–21) = 45.
  Thus, N = 2401 − 144 − 45 = 2401 − 189 = 2212.

Step 3. Adding the Neighboring Numbers

Now we add the eight values:
 A: 2208
 B: 2209
 C: 2210
 D: 2025
 E: 2211
 F: 1850
 G: 2027
 H: 2212

Let’s add them step‐by‐step:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,952.

──────────────────────────────
Answer: 16952

This is the final answer.
