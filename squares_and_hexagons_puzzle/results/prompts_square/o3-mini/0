We wish to find the sum of the numbers that lie in the 8 grid‐cells immediately surrounding the cell that holds the number 2026. In our spiral the numbers are arranged as

  … 5 4 3 …  
  … 6 1 2 …  
  … 7 8 9 …

with 1 at the center (which we take as coordinate (0,0)) and the spiral “unwinding” in counterclockwise order – so that

  1 is at (0,0)  
  2 is at (1,0)  
  3 is at (1,1)  
  4 is at (0,1)  
  5 is at (–1,1)  
  6 is at (–1,0)  
  7 is at (–1,–1)  
  8 is at (0,–1)  
  9 is at (1,–1).

The neighbor cells of a number at (x,y) are the eight cells with coordinates

  (x–1, y–1), (x  , y–1), (x+1, y–1),
  (x–1, y  ),    — (x+1, y  ),
  (x–1, y+1), (x  , y+1), (x+1, y+1).

Thus, once we know the “grid position” (x,y) of 2026 we can compute the positions of its 8 neighbors and then determine the number written in each cell. (Because the spiral is “deterministic” there is a formula that takes a coordinate (x,y) and tells you the number written there.)

Step 1. Locate 2026 in the spiral

A standard fact for this spiral (often seen as Ulam’s spiral) is that the numbers lie in square “layers” around 1. In particular, if 1 is layer 0 then for any layer k ≥ 1 the odd square
  L² = (2k+1)²
appears at the bottom‐right corner (at coordinate (k, –k)). For example, when k = 1 the number 3² = 9 lies at (1,–1) and when k = 23 the number 47² = 2209 lies at (23,–23).

To decide which layer contains 2026 we note that
  45² = 2025 and 47² = 2209.
Since 2026 is greater than 2025, it lies in the next “ring”, namely the one with k = 23.

For layer k = 23 the “square” has side length L = 2·23+1 = 47 and its maximum (corner) is
  m = 47² = 2209.
Then one may show that if one sets

  d = m – n      (here d = 2209 – 2026 = 183)

then writing
  side = ⎣d⁄(L–1)⎦   and   r = d mod (L–1)
one obtains a “side‐number” and an “offset” r, and a useful formula for the coordinates of n.

For the spiral described here one acceptable formula is to declare that:
 • If side = 0 (i.e. d is in [0, L–1)) then n lies on the bottom row (y = –k) with
  n = m – (k – x)   so that (x,y) = (k – d, –k).
 • If side = 1 then n lies on the left column (x = –k) with
  n = m – [(L–1) + (y+k)]   so that (x,y) = (–k, –k + r).
 • If side = 2 then n lies on the top row (y = k) with
  n = m – [2(L–1) + (x + k)]   so that (x,y) = (–k + r, k).
 • If side = 3 then n lies on the right column (x = k) with
  n = m – [3(L–1) + (k – y)]   so that (x,y) = (k, k – r).

For our n = 2026 we computed:
  d = 2209 – 2026 = 183,
and since L – 1 = 46 we have
  side = 183 ÷ 46 = 3   (since 46·3 = 138)
and
  r = 183 – 138 = 45.
Then by the last case,
  ( x, y ) = (k, k – r) = (23, 23 – 45) = (23, –22).

Thus 2026 is located at coordinate (23, –22).

Step 2. Determine the coordinates of its eight neighbors

The neighbors (in (x,y) coordinates) are:
 A: (22, –23)  B: (23, –23)  C: (24, –23)
 D: (22, –22)         E: (24, –22)
 F: (22, –21)  G: (23, –21)  H: (24, –21).

Step 3. For each neighbor coordinate, compute the number written there

A standard “coordinate to number” conversion for this spiral is as follows. Given any coordinate (x,y) let k = max(|x|, |y|). Then
  L = 2k + 1   and   m = L².
Now the number depends on which side of the square (of the ring) (x,y) lies:

1. If y = –k (bottom row) then
  n = m – (k – x).

2. If x = –k (left side) then
  n = m – [(L–1) + (y + k)].

3. If y = k (top row) then
  n = m – [2(L–1) + (x + k)].

4. If x = k (right side) then
  n = m – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].

We now use these rules for each neighbor.

Neighbor A. (22, –23)
 Determine k: max(|22|, |–23|) = 23, so L = 47 and m = 2209.
 Since y = –23 equals –k, use rule (1):
  n = 2209 – (23 – 22) = 2209 – 1 = 2208.

Neighbor B. (23, –23)
 Here k = 23 (since 23 and 23) and y = –23 = –k. So:
  n = 2209 – (23 – 23) = 2209 – 0 = 2209.

Neighbor C. (24, –23)
 Here |24| = 24 and |–23| = 23 so k = 24. Then L = 49 and m = 49² = 2401.
 The coordinate: (24, –23) has x = 24 = k so it’s on the right side.
 For rule (4): r = k – y = 24 – (–23) = 47.
 Then n = 2401 – [3(49–1) + 47]. Note L–1 = 48 so 3·48 = 144.
 Thus n = 2401 – (144 + 47) = 2401 – 191 = 2210.

Neighbor D. (22, –22)
 Here max(|22|, |–22|) = 22 so k = 22, L = 45, m = 45² = 2025.
 Since y = –22 equals –k, use rule (1):
  n = 2025 – (22 – 22) = 2025.

Neighbor E. (24, –22)
 For (24, –22) we have k = max(24, 22) = 24 so L = 49 and m = 2401.
 Since x = 24 = k, we’re on the right side.
 Then r = k – y = 24 – (–22) = 46.
 So n = 2401 – [144 + 46] = 2401 – 190 = 2211.

Neighbor F. (22, –21)
 Here max(|22|, |–21|) = 22 so k = 22, L = 45, m = 2025.
 Which side? Notice x = 22 equals k, so it is on the right side.
 Then r = k – y = 22 – (–21) = 43.
 So by rule (4): n = 2025 – [3(44) + 43] = 2025 – (132 + 43) = 2025 – 175 = 1850.
 (Recall L–1 = 44 when k = 22.)

Neighbor G. (23, –21)
 Now max(|23|, |–21|) = 23 so k = 23, L = 47, m = 2209.
 Since x = 23 equals k, use rule (4): r = 23 – (–21) = 44.
 Then n = 2209 – [3·46 + 44] = 2209 – (138 + 44) = 2209 – 182 = 2027.

Neighbor H. (24, –21)
 Here max(|24|, |–21|) = 24 so k = 24, L = 49, m = 2401.
 Since x = 24 = k, rule (4) applies with r = 24 – (–21) = 45.
 Then n = 2401 – [144 + 45] = 2401 – 189 = 2212.

Step 4. Sum the eight neighbor numbers

We obtained:
 A: 2208
 B: 2209
 C: 2210
 D: 2025
 E: 2211
 F: 1850
 G: 2027
 H: 2212

Now add them:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952  

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16,952.

Final Answer: 16952.
