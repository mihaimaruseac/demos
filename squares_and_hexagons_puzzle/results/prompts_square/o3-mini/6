We wish to find the sum of the numbers written in the eight grid‐neighbors of 2026 on the usual “spiral” (or “Ulam” spiral) in which

   … 5  4  3 … 
   … 6  1  2 … 
   … 7  8  9 …

with 1 placed at the grid origin (0,0), 2 just to its right (1,0), 3 next “up” (1,1), etc.

The plan is as follows:
 1. Find the grid coordinates (x,y) where 2026 lies.
 2. Write down the coordinates of its eight neighbors.
 3. For each neighbor, “invert” the spiral formula to recover the number written there.
 4. Sum the eight numbers.

Below is one way to do this.

────────────────────────
Step 1. Finding the Coordinates of 2026

A standard fact about this spiral is that the numbers lie in “rings” around 1. For a number n > 1, define k to be the ring number so that
  (2k–1)² < n ≤ (2k+1)².
Alternatively, one may use the formulas below that “invert” the Ulam spiral construction.

For numbers on ring k (with k ≥ 1) the side length L = 2k+1 and the maximum number on that ring is 
  m = L².
Moreover, one may determine the coordinates from n as follows:
 • Let d = m – n.
 • Then:
  – If d < L–1, then n is on the bottom row and its coordinates are (x,y) = (k – d, –k).
  – Else if d < 2(L–1), then n is on the left column: (x,y) = (–k, –k + (d – (L–1))).
  – Else if d < 3(L–1), then n is on the top row: (x,y) = (–k + (d – 2(L–1)), k).
  – Else (i.e. d < 4(L–1)), then n is on the right column: (x,y) = (k, k – (d – 3(L–1))).

Now, for n = 2026 let’s find its ring.

• We look for k with (2k+1)² ≥ 2026.
 For k = 22: (45)² = 2025, but 2025 < 2026.
 For k = 23: (47)² = 2209 ≥ 2026.
Thus, 2026 is on the 23rd ring, with
  L = 2×23+1 = 47  and  m = 2209.
Also, d = 2209 – 2026 = 183.
Since L–1 = 46, note that
  183 ≥ 3×46 = 138  and  183 < 4×46 = 184.
Thus, we are in the “else” case (the right column). Then the coordinates of 2026 are
  x = k = 23  and  y = k – (d – 3(L–1)) = 23 – [183 – 138] = 23 – 45 = –22.
So 2026 is at (23, –22).

────────────────────────
Step 2. Listing the 8 Neighbors

The eight (immediate, horizontally/vertically/diagonally adjacent) neighbors of (23, –22) are:
  (22, –23), (23, –23), (24, –23),
  (22, –22),        (24, –22),
  (22, –21), (23, –21), (24, –21).

────────────────────────
Step 3. Finding the Numbers at a Given Coordinate

A useful “inverse” formula works as follows. For any grid point (x, y):
 a. Let k = max(|x|, |y|).
  – If k = 0 then the point must be (0,0), which holds the number 1.
 b. Otherwise, form
   L = 2k + 1  and  m = L².
 Then, depending on which side the point lies:
  • If y = –k (bottom row) then 
   number = m – (k – x).
  • If x = –k (left column) then 
   number = m – [(L–1) + (y + k)].
  • If y = k (top row) then 
   number = m – [2(L–1) + (x + k)].
  • If x = k (right column) then 
   number = m – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].

We now apply this to each neighbor.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 1. (22, –23)

Here, |22| = 22 and |–23| = 23 so k = 23, L = 47, m = 2209.
Since y = –23 equals –k, we are on the bottom row.
Number = m – (k – x) = 2209 – (23 – 22) = 2209 – 1 = 2208.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 2. (23, –23)

Again k = 23.
Since y = –23 (bottom row), 
Number = 2209 – (23 – 23) = 2209.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 3. (24, –23)

Here, |24| = 24 (and |–23| = 23) so k = 24.
Then L = 2×24+1 = 49 and m = 49² = 2401.
Notice that y = –23 is not equal to –24 (the “bottom row” for ring 24), and x = 24, so we are on the right column.
Thus, number = m – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].
Here L–1 = 48 and k – y = 24 – (–23) = 47.
So, number = 2401 – [3×48 + 47] = 2401 – (144 + 47) = 2401 – 191 = 2210.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 4. (22, –22)

Here, |22| = 22 so k = 22, L = 45, m = 45² = 2025.
Since y = –22 equals –k for k = 22,
Number = m – (k – x) = 2025 – (22 – 22) = 2025.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 5. (24, –22)

Here, |24| = 24 so k = 24, L = 49, m = 2401.
Now, y = –22 is not –24; but x = 24 equals k so we are on the right column.
Then, number = 2401 – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].
With L–1 = 48 and k – y = 24 – (–22) = 46,
Number = 2401 – [144 + 46] = 2401 – 190 = 2211.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 6. (22, –21)

Here, |22| = 22 so k = 22, L = 45, m = 2025.
Now, (22, –21) has x = 22 which is k.
Thus, it lies on the right column.
Then, number = m – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].
For L = 45, L–1 = 44 and k – y = 22 – (–21) = 43.
So, number = 2025 – (3×44 + 43) = 2025 – (132 + 43) = 2025 – 175 = 1850.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 7. (23, –21)

Here, |23| = 23 so k = 23, L = 47, m = 2209.
We have x = 23 = k, so again we use the right column rule.
Then, number = 2209 – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].
Now L–1 = 46 and k – y = 23 – (–21) = 44.
Thus, number = 2209 – (138 + 44) = 2209 – 182 = 2027.

────────────────────────
Neighbor 8. (24, –21)

For this point, |24| = 24 so k = 24, L = 49, m = 2401.
Since x = 24 = k (right column), we have
Number = 2401 – [3(L–1) + (k – y)].
Here L–1 = 48 and k – y = 24 – (–21) = 45.
So, number = 2401 – (144 + 45) = 2401 – 189 = 2212.

────────────────────────
Step 4. Summing the Eight Neighbors

We found:
 (22, –23): 2208
 (23, –23): 2209
 (24, –23): 2210
 (22, –22): 2025
 (24, –22): 2211
 (22, –21): 1850
 (23, –21): 2027
 (24, –21): 2212

Now add them:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952

Thus, the sum is 16,952.

────────────────────────
Final Answer

The sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is 16,952.
