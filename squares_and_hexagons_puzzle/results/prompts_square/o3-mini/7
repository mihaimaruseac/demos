We wish to find the sum of the eight numbers that “touch” the number 2026 in the spiral. (Here “touch” means horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.)

In the spiral the numbers are arranged in “rings” around 1. For example, the spiral begins

  … 5 4 3 …  
  … 6 1 2 …  
  … 7 8 9 …

When using “spiral coordinates” we take 1 to be at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (–1,1), etc.

A standard way to generate this spiral is that the numbers are grouped into rings. If you define ring r (with r ≥ 1) as the set of numbers that lie at a “radius” r from the origin (i.e. numbers sitting on the border of the square of side‐length 2r+1), one finds that the largest number in ring r is
  M = (2r+1)²,
and it appears at the “bottom‐right” corner with coordinates (r, –r).

For example, for r = 1 the maximum is 9 = 3² at (1, –1); for r = 2 the maximum is 25 = 5² at (2, –2).

Step 1. Locate 2026 in the Spiral

• First, find the “ring” that contains the number 2026. Notice that 2025 = 45². Since 45² has a square root that is odd, it is the maximum of ring r = 22 (because 2·22 + 1 = 45). Therefore, 2025 is the last number of ring 22 and it sits at (22, –22).

• The very next number is 2026. When the spiral “grows” one ring outward the construction works as follows. After finishing ring 22 (with maximum 2025 at (22, –22)), one “starts” ring 23 by taking one step to the right. In other words, the first number of ring 23 (r = 23) is placed at
  (23, –22).
Thus, in our coordinate system we have
  2026 at (23, –22).

For ring 23 the maximum number is at (23, –23) and is
  M = (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209.
Also, the numbers in ring 23 are placed in four “sides” in this order (starting at the “start‐cell” of the ring at (23, –22)):
1. Right side: moving upward from (23, –22) to (23, 23).
2. Top side: moving leftward from (22, 23) down to (–23, 23).
3. Left side: moving downward from (–23, 22) to (–23, –23).
4. Bottom side: moving rightward from (–22, –23) to (23, –23) (which is 2209).

Step 2. Identify the Neighboring Coordinates

The eight grid neighbors of the cell at (23, –22) are the cells whose coordinates are:

 A: (22, –23) B: (23, –23) C: (24, –23)
 D: (22, –22)      E: (24, –22)
 F: (22, –21)  G: (23, –21)  H: (24, –21)

Note that some of these neighbors lie in ring 23, some in ring 22, and some in the new ring 24.

Step 3. Find the Number Written at Each Neighbor

We now “read off” or determine the number at each neighbor using the spiral ordering.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor B – (23, –23):
──────────────────────────────
This is the bottom–right corner of ring 23. By definition its number is the maximum of ring 23:
  B = 2209.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbor G – (23, –21):
──────────────────────────────
Coordinates (23, –21) are on the right side of ring 23. (Remember that the right side of ring 23 runs vertically from (23, –22) up to (23, 23).) In our spiral, the numbers on each side are consecutive. Since the first number on the right side of ring 23 is 2026 at (23, –22), the next cell upward is
  (23, –21) with number 2027.
Thus, G = 2027.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbors on Ring 23 – Bottom Side (A on the “upper end” of bottom side)
──────────────────────────────
The bottom side of ring 23 runs from (–22, –23) to (23, –23) (moving from left to right). We first find the value at the left end:
• The bottom side begins immediately after finishing the left side. One may show that the first cell of the bottom side, at (–22, –23), is assigned the number
  2164.
Then the cells increase by 1 as we move to the right. 

Now:
• Neighbor A is at (22, –23). Write the x–coordinate in terms of a “step index” on the bottom side. The bottom side starts at x = –22; moving right, each unit adds 1. We require
  –22 + i = 22  ⟹ i = 44.
Since the first cell on this side (i = 0) is 2164, the number at (22, –23) is
  A = 2164 + 44 = 2208.

• Neighbor B we already have (at (23, –23)) and indeed must be the next cell. (For consistency, the cell at (23, –23) would be index i = 45, and 2164 + 45 = 2209.)

──────────────────────────────
Neighbors on Ring 24 – (C, E, and H)
──────────────────────────────
When moving from ring 23 to ring 24 the spiral “starts” a new ring. The first number of ring 24 (r = 24) is placed by taking one step to the right from ring 23’s maximum layer. The “start–cell” for ring 24 is at coordinates
  (24, –23)
and is assigned the number
  2210.
Then along the right side of ring 24 the cells go upward.
So:
• Neighbor C, at (24, –23), is exactly the start of ring 24. Therefore, C = 2210.
• Next, on the right side of ring 24: (24, –22) is the cell immediately above (24, –23), so it gets
  E = 2211.
• And one step further up: (24, –21) then is
  H = 2212.

──────────────────────────────
Neighbors on Ring 22 – (D and F)
──────────────────────────────
Remember that 2025 = 45² is the maximum of ring 22 and lies at (22, –22). So:
• D: (22, –22) is exactly this bottom–right corner of ring 22. Thus, D = 2025.
Next, consider neighbor F at (22, –21). Its “radius” is max(|22|, |–21|) = 22 so it lies in ring 22.
For ring 22 the pattern is as follows:
 • The ring’s numbers run from 1850 up to 2025 (since the previous ring’s maximum is 43² = 1849, ring 22 has 8·22 = 176 numbers, with its first number being 1849 + 1 = 1850).
 • The right side of ring 22 runs vertically along x = 22, with its cells beginning at (22, –21) and increasing as y increases.
Thus, the starting cell on the right side of ring 22, at (22, –21), gets the first number of ring 22:
  F = 1850.
──────────────────────────────

Step 4. Sum the Neighbors

Now we list the numbers we found:

 A: (22, –23) = 2208  
 B: (23, –23) = 2209  
 C: (24, –23) = 2210  
 D: (22, –22) = 2025  
 E: (24, –22) = 2211  
 F: (22, –21) = 1850  
 G: (23, –21) = 2027  
 H: (24, –21) = 2212

Let’s add them step‐by‐step:
 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952

Thus, the sum of the eight neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,952.
