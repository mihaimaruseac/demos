We want to find the sum of the eight numbers (the eight “neighbors”) that are written immediately around the number 2026 in the spiral

  … 5 4 3 …  
  … 6 1 2 …  
  … 7 8 9 …

In this spiral the numbers “wind” around the center 1. With a convenient choice of coordinates, we let the center 1 be at (0,0). (x increases to the right and y increases upward.) Then one finds

  1 is at (0,0)  
  2 at (1,0)  
  3 at (1,1)  
  4 at (0,1)  
  5 at (–1,1)  
  6 at (–1,0)  
  7 at (–1,–1)  
  8 at (0,–1)  
  9 at (1,–1)  

and so on. In general the spiral is built in “rings.” The ring with radius m (m = 0, 1, 2, …) is the one whose outermost numbers lie on the square with side‐length 2m+1. In fact, the largest number on the mth ring is (2m+1)² and it appears in the lower‐right corner at (m, –m).

Below we describe step‐by‐step how to find the neighbors of 2026 and then sum their values.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Locate 2026 in the Spiral

First notice that the numbers on the mth ring run from (2(m–1)+1)²+1 up to (2m+1)². For example, ring 1 consists of 2,...,9 (since 1² = 1 and 3² = 9) and ring 2 contains 10,...,25.

Find the ring for 2026. We have:
  For m = 22: (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.
  For m = 23: (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209.

Since 2026 is greater than 2025 but less than or equal to 2209, it lies in the m = 23 ring. In this ring the “largest” number is 2209 at the coordinate (23, –23).

We now define the “offset” from the maximum:
  offset = 2209 – 2026 = 183.

It turns out that the numbers in a ring are arranged along four sides of the square. (It is standard that if you “unwind” the spiral from the maximum, you move along the perimeter.) For ring m the total number of numbers on the ring is
  8m    (here, 8·23 = 184).
We now subdivide the ring into 4 segments, each of length 2m (here 46). The segments (writing “backwards” from the maximum) are:

Segment 0 (bottom row): starting at the maximum (m, –m) and moving left.
  Coordinates on this segment: (m – d, –m) for d from 0 to 2m–1.
Segment 1 (left column): going upward along x = –m.
  Coordinates: (–m, –m + d) for d from 1 to 2m.
Segment 2 (top row): moving right along y = m.
  Coordinates: (–m + d, m) for d from 1 to 2m.
Segment 3 (right column): going downward along x = m.
  Coordinates: (m, m – d) for d from 1 to 2m.

Now, determine in which segment the offset 183 falls. For m = 23:
  2m = 46, 4m = 92, 6m = 138, 8m = 184.
Since 183 lies in the fourth segment (because 183 ≥ 138 and < 184), we set
  r = offset – 6m = 183 – 138 = 45.
Then the coordinates of 2026 are given by the formula for segment 3:
  (x, y) = (m, m – r) = (23, 23 – 45) = (23, –22).

Thus 2026 is placed at (23, –22).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Determine the Coordinates of the 8 Neighbors

The neighbors of (23, –22) are the points with coordinates (x + dx, y + dy) where dx, dy ∈ {–1, 0, 1} except (0, 0). They are:

  (22, –23), (23, –23), (24, –23),
  (22, –22),      (24, –22),
  (22, –21), (23, –21), (24, –21).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Figure Out the Spiral Number at a Given Coordinate

A standard way to “invert” the spiral construction is as follows. For any grid coordinate (a, b), let
  m = max(|a|, |b|).
Then the number at the “extremal” position—that is, at (m, –m)—is 
  n = (2m+1)².
Depending on which “side” (a, b) lies on, one obtains its value as follows:

1. If the point is on the bottom row (y = –m):
  value = n – (m – a).

2. If it is on the left column (x = –m):
  value = n – 2m – (b + m).  
    (Notice: when b is –m the result gives the bottom‐left corner.)

3. If it is on the top row (y = m):
  value = n – 4m – (a + m).

4. If it is on the right column (x = m):
  value = n – 6m – (m – b).

It can be checked that these formulas work—for example, for ring 1: the maximum n = 3² = 9 is at (1, –1).

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Compute the Values at Each of the 8 Neighbors

Now we compute neighbor by neighbor.

1. For (22, –23):
 • m = max(|22|, |–23|) = 23.
 • Here y = –23 equals –m, so it is on the bottom row.
 • n = (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209.
 • value = n – (23 – 22) = 2209 – 1 = 2208.

2. For (23, –23):
 • m = 23 (since |23| = 23, |–23| = 23).
 • y = –23, so bottom row.
 • value = 2209 – (23 – 23) = 2209.

3. For (24, –23):
 • m = max(|24|, |–23|) = 24.
 • Now m = 24 so n = (2·24+1)² = 49² = 2401.
 • Check the coordinate: (24, –23) does not have y = –24, but x = 24 equals m so it is on the right column.
 • Use the right column formula:
  value = n – 7·m + y = 2401 – 7·24 + (–23).
  7·24 = 168, so value = 2401 – 168 – 23 = 2210.

4. For (22, –22):
 • m = max(|22|, |–22|) = 22.
 • Then n = (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.
 • Here y = –22 equals –m so bottom row.
  value = n – (22 – 22) = 2025.

  (Note: In fact, (22, –22) is the maximum of ring 22.)

5. For (24, –22):
 • m = max(|24|, |–22|) = 24.
 • n = 49² = 2401.
 • Since x = 24 (which equals m) the point is on the right column.
  value = 2401 – 7·24 + (–22) = 2401 – 168 – 22 = 2211.

6. For (22, –21):
 • m = max(|22|, |–21|) = 22.
 • n = 45² = 2025.
 • Here x = 22 equals m, so the point is on the right column.
  value = n – 7·22 + (–21) = 2025 – 154 – 21.
  7·22 = 154, so value = 2025 – 175 = 1850.

7. For (23, –21):
 • m = max(|23|, |–21|) = 23.
 • n = 47² = 2209.
 • Since x = 23 equals m this is on the right column.
  value = 2209 – 7·23 + (–21) = 2209 – 161 – 21.
  7·23 = 161, so value = 2209 – 182 = 2027.

8. For (24, –21):
 • m = max(|24|, |–21|) = 24.
 • n = 2401.
 • x = 24 so right column.
  value = 2401 – 7·24 + (–21) = 2401 – 168 – 21 = 2212.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Add the 8 Values

Now add them:

 (22, –23): 2208  
 (23, –23): 2209  
 (24, –23): 2210  
 (22, –22): 2025  
 (24, –22): 2211  
 (22, –21): 1850  
 (23, –21): 2027  
 (24, –21): 2212

Let’s sum them step‐by‐step:

 2208 + 2209 = 4417  
 4417 + 2210 = 6627  
 6627 + 2025 = 8652  
 8652 + 2211 = 10863  
 10863 + 1850 = 12713  
 12713 + 2027 = 14740  
 14740 + 2212 = 16952

──────────────────────────────
Answer

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16952.
