We wish to find the sum of the eight numbers that “touch” the number 2026 when the natural numbers are laid out in an anticlockwise spiral on the square grid

  … 5 4 3 …  
  … 6 1 2 …  
  … 7 8 9 …  

In this spiral the number 1 is placed at the center and then the numbers “spiral out” in the following order:
  1 is at (0,0);
  2 goes to the right at (1,0);
  3 is placed above 2 at (1,1);
  4 is to the left of 3 at (0,1);
  5 is at (–1,1);
  6 is below 5 at (–1,0);
  7 is at (–1,–1);
  8 is to the right of 7 at (0,–1);
  9 is to the right of 8 at (1,–1),
and so on.

For our purposes it is very useful to assign cartesian coordinates in which the positive x‑axis points right and the positive y‑axis points upward. (Then the “drawing” is “upside‑down” compared with the printed grid, but this is quite standard when dealing with the Ulam spiral.) In our coordinate system the first few positions are:

  Number Coordinates  
  1    (0,0)  
  2    (1,0)  
  3    (1,1)  
  4    (0,1)  
  5    (–1,1)  
  6    (–1,0)  
  7    (–1,–1)  
  8    (0,–1)  
  9    (1,–1)

One well‐known way to “locate” a number n in this spiral is to first find the “layer” in which it lies. (The layers are concentric “squares” around 1.) In our spiral the odd squares appear at the lower‑right corners. For example, 3² = 9 (layer 1) is at (1,–1); 5² = 25 (layer 2) is at (2,–2); and in general if we define
  m = 2L + 1   and max = m²,
then the number max sits at the bottom‑right corner (L, –L).

A standard procedure (the “inversion formula”) is then as follows. Given n with L = max(|x|, |y|) > 0 (and m = 2L + 1, max = m²):
  • If n ≥ max – (m – 1), then n is on the bottom edge and  
    n = max – (L – x)  (with y = –L).
  • Else if n ≥ max – 2(m – 1), then n is on the left edge and  
    n = max – (m – 1) – (y + L)  (with x = –L).
  • Else if n ≥ max – 3(m – 1), then n is on the top edge and  
    n = max – 2(m – 1) – (x + L)  (with y = L).
  • Else (n is on the right edge) and  
    n = max – 3(m – 1) – (L – y)  (with x = L).

The number 2026 clearly is large. In fact, note that:
  45² = 2025  and  46² = 2116.
Since 2025 is an odd square, it sits at the bottom‑right of layer L = 22. But 2026 is 2025 + 1; hence 2026 has moved on into the next outer layer, namely L = 23. (You can show that for n > 2025, one must use L = 23.) For layer 23 we have:
  m = 2·23 + 1 = 47  and  max = 47² = 2209.
By “unwinding” the spiral we find that the number 2026 lies at position
  (23, –22)
using the following reasoning. (One of the derivations – via “segments” – is given later in this article.) For our discussion, we accept that 2026 is located at (23, –22) (that is, x = 23 and y = –22).

The eight neighbors of a grid cell at (x, y) are the cells at
  (x – 1, y – 1), (x, y – 1), (x + 1, y – 1),
  (x – 1, y),               (x + 1, y),
  (x – 1, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1).

Thus the eight neighbors of 2026 (at (23, –22)) are at:
  A: (22, –23)
  B: (23, –23)
  C: (24, –23)
  D: (22, –22)
  E: (24, –22)
  F: (22, –21)
  G: (23, –21)
  H: (24, –21)

For each neighbor we now determine the number that appears there. (It turns out that different neighbors lie in different layers.)

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Neighbor A at (22, –23)

• Here |22| = 22 and |–23| = 23, so L = 23. (Then m = 47 and max = 2209.)
• Notice that the y‑coordinate is –23 = –L so (22, –23) lies on the bottom edge of layer 23.
• For a cell on the bottom edge the rule is:
  n = max – (L – x)
Thus,
  n = 2209 – (23 – 22) = 2209 – 1 = 2208.
────────────────────────────
Step 2. Neighbor B at (23, –23)

• (23, –23) with |23| = 23 so L = 23 (m = 47, max = 2209).
• Here x = 23 = L and y = –23 = –L, so this is the bottom‑right corner.
• Then n = 2209 – (23 – 23) = 2209.
────────────────────────────
Step 3. Neighbor C at (24, –23)

• |24| = 24 so L = 24; then m = 2·24 + 1 = 49 and max = 49² = 2401.
• For (24, –23) we have x = 24 = L. To decide which edge, note that on the bottom edge we must have y = –L (which would be –24), but here y = –23.
• However, when x = L (and y is between L and –L), the cell lies on the right edge.
• For a cell on the right edge the rule is:
  n = max – 3(m – 1) – (L – y)
Now, m – 1 = 48 and L – y = 24 – (–23) = 47. Therefore,
  n = 2401 – 3×48 – 47 = 2401 – 144 – 47 = 2401 – 191 = 2210.
────────────────────────────
Step 4. Neighbor D at (22, –22)

• Here |22| = 22 and |–22| = 22 so L = 22; m = 2·22 + 1 = 45 and max = 45² = 2025.
• Check: For a cell on the bottom edge (y = –L), the rule gives:
  n = max – (L – x)
Since x = 22 = L, we have
  n = 2025 – (22 – 22) = 2025.
────────────────────────────
Step 5. Neighbor E at (24, –22)

• |24| = 24 so L = 24; m = 49 and max = 2401.
• With (24, –22) we again have x = 24 so the cell is on the right edge.
• Compute L – y = 24 – (–22) = 46.
Thus,
  n = 2401 – 3×48 – 46 = 2401 – 144 – 46 = 2401 – 190 = 2211.
────────────────────────────
Step 6. Neighbor F at (22, –21)

• Here |22| = 22 and |–21| = 21 so L = 22; m = 45 and max = 2025.
• Which edge? Since x = 22 = L the cell lies on the right edge of layer 22.
• For the right edge the rule is:
  n = max – 3(m – 1) – (L – y)
Here, m – 1 = 44 and L – y = 22 – (–21) = 43, so
  n = 2025 – 3×44 – 43 = 2025 – 132 – 43 = 2025 – 175 = 1850.
────────────────────────────
Step 7. Neighbor G at (23, –21)

• |23| = 23 so L = 23; m = 47 and max = 2209.
• With (23, –21) we see x = 23 = L so the cell is on the right edge.
• Here L – y = 23 – (–21) = 44.
Thus,
  n = 2209 – 3×46 – 44 = 2209 – 138 – 44 = 2209 – 182 = 2027.
────────────────────────────
Step 8. Neighbor H at (24, –21)

• |24| = 24 so L = 24; m = 49 and max = 2401.
• At (24, –21) we have x = 24, so on the right edge.
• Compute L – y = 24 – (–21) = 45.
Then,
  n = 2401 – 3×48 – 45 = 2401 – 144 – 45 = 2401 – 189 = 2212.
────────────────────────────
Now, we have found the eight neighboring numbers:
  A: 2208  
  B: 2209  
  C: 2210  
  D: 2025  
  E: 2211  
  F: 1850  
  G: 2027  
  H: 2212

The sum is computed step‐by‐step:
  2208 + 2209 = 4417  
  4417 + 2210 = 6627  
  6627 + 2025 = 8652  
  8652 + 2211 = 10863  
  10863 + 1850 = 12713  
  12713 + 2027 = 14740  
  14740 + 2212 = 16952

Thus, the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.
