To determine the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, first identify its position. The spiral starts at 1 in the center, with numbers increasing outward in a counterclockwise pattern: right, up, left, down, expanding layers.

The layer \(k\) (starting from \(k=0\) at the center) has side length \(2k+1\) and contains \(8k\) numbers (for \(k \geq 1\)). The last number in layer \(k\) is \((2k+1)^2\).

Solve \((2k+1)^2 \geq 2026 > (2(k-1)+1)^2\):
- \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01\), so \(k=22\) (since \(45^2=2025\), \(47^2=2209\)).
- 2026 is the second number in layer 22 (right after 2025 at the bottom-right corner).

Coordinates (center 1 at (0,0), x right, y up):
- 2025 at (22, -22).
- 2026 at (21, -22).

Its eight neighbors are at:
- (20, -23), (21, -23), (22, -23)
- (20, -22),           (22, -22)
- (20, -21), (21, -21), (22, -21)

Their values:
- (20, -23): 2027
- (21, -23): 2028
- (22, -23): 2029
- (20, -22): 2034
- (22, -22): 2025
- (20, -21): 2033
- (21, -21): 2032
- (22, -21): 2031

Sum: 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2034 + 2025 + 2033 + 2032 + 2031 = 16219.
