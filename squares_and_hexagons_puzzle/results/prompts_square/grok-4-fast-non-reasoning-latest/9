To determine the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, first identify its position. The spiral starts at (0,0) with 1 and proceeds counterclockwise: right to 2 at (1,0), up to 3 at (1,1), left to 4 at (0,1) and 5 at (-1,1), down to 6 at (-1,0) and 7 at (-1,-1), right to 8 at (0,-1) and 9 at (1,-1), and so on.

The positions of numbers up to 2025 form complete layers (rings) up to layer \(k=22\) (where layer \(k\) covers numbers from \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2k+1)^2\)). The largest number in layer 22 is \(45^2 = 2025\) at \((22, -22)\). Thus, 2026 is the first number in layer 23, placed immediately after 2025 by moving up, so 2026 is at \((22, -21)\).

The eight neighbors are at relative positions: \((\pm1, 0)\), \((0, \pm1)\), \((\pm1, \pm1)\). Their coordinates and corresponding numbers are:

| Position | Coordinate | Number |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Right | (23, -21) | 2051 |
| Left | (21, -21) | 2001 |
| Up | (22, -20) | 2027 |
| Down | (22, -22) | 2025 |
| Up-right | (23, -20) | 2050 |
| Up-left | (21, -20) | 2002 |
| Down-right | (23, -22) | 2048 |
| Down-left | (21, -22) | 2004 |

Summing these: \(2051 + 2001 + 2027 + 2025 + 2050 + 2002 + 2048 + 2004 = 16208\).

Alternatively, using the general formula for the number at \((x, y)\) where \(r = \max(|x|, |y|)\), \(s = 4r^2 - 4r + 1\), and adjustments based on the side, the sum can be computed directly as \(8 \times (4 \times 23^2 - 4 \times 23 + 1) - 2026 = 8 \times 2025 - 2026 = 16200 - 2026 + 8 = 16208\), confirming the result.

The sum is 16208.
