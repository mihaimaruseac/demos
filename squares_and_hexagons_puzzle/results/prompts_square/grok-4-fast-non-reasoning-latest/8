To determine the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, first identify its position. The spiral starts at (0,0) with 1 and proceeds right, then counterclockwise. The position of \(n\) is found by determining the layer \(k = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil - 1\) (where layer 0 is just 1), then locating \(n\) within that layer.

For \(n = 2026\), \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01\), so \(k = 45\). The bottom-right corner of layer 45 is \(m = (2k+1)^2 = 91^2 = 8281\). The number 2026 is on the right side of the layer, specifically the \((m - 2026 + 1) = 6257\)th position from the bottom-right corner moving up, but its exact coordinates are \((45, -44)\).

The eight neighbors are at relative positions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals. Their values are:

- 2025 (left)
- 2027 (right)
- 1970 (down)
- 2082 (up)
- 1969 (down-left)
- 1971 (down-right)
- 2081 (up-left)
- 2083 (up-right)

Summing these: \(2025 + 2027 + 1970 + 2082 + 1969 + 1971 + 2081 + 2083 = 16208\).

\boxed{16208}
