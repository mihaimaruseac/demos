To solve this, I need to determine the position of 2026 in the spiral and identify its eight neighbors. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and proceeds right, then counterclockwise: up, left, down, right, and so on, increasing the side length by 2 each full cycle.

The spiral's layers are indexed starting from 0 (just the center 1). Layer \(k \geq 1\) forms a square frame with side length \(2k+1\) and contains \(8k\) numbers. The largest number in layer \(k\) is \(n_k = (2k+1)^2\).

Solve \((2k+1)^2 \geq 2026\):
- \(44^2 = 1936 < 2026\)
- \(46^2 = 2116 > 2026\)

Thus, \(k=22\) (since \(2 \cdot 22 + 1 = 45\), but wait—actually, \(n_{22} = 45^2 = 2025\), and \(n_{23} = 47^2 = 2209 > 2026\), so 2026 is in layer 23.

Correcting: \(n_k = (2k+1)^2\), so for \(k=22\), \(n_{22} = 45^2 = 2025\). Then layer 23 starts at 2026 and goes to \(47^2 = 2209\).

Layer 23 has 8 \cdot 23 = 184 numbers: 2026 to 2209.

The path in layer 23 (counterclockwise from the end of layer 22):
- Right side: 2026 to 2046 (21 numbers, y=23, x=23 down to 3)
- Top side: 2047 to 2069 (23 numbers, x=2 to 24, y=22)
- Left side: 2070 to 2092 (23 numbers, y=21 down to -1, x=-2)
- Bottom side: 2093 to 2215? Wait, only up to 2209 (117 numbers total so far? Wait, miscalc.

Standard Ulam spiral path for layer k: starts after (2k-1)^2, goes right k*2-1 steps? Better way: position of n.

For n=2026 = 2025 +1 = n_{22} +1, it is the first number in layer 23, immediately right of 2025.

2025 is at (22, -22) (defining center (0,0)=1, positive x right, positive y up).

Standard coordinates:
- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)
- Then 10 at (2,-1), etc.

The largest in layer k, n_k = (2k+1)^2, is at (k, -k).

For k=1, n=9 at (1,-1), yes.

For k=2, n=25 at (2,-2), yes.

So for k=22, 2025 at (22, -22).

Layer 23 starts by going right from there: but wait, after bottom-right corner, next direction is up along the right side.

From 2025 at (22,-22), the next number 2026 is at (23, -22), moving right (positive x).

Yes.

So position of 2026: (23, -22)

The eight neighbors are the cells at (x+dx, y+dy) for dx,dy in {-1,0,1} excluding (0,0).

So positions:
- (22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23)
- (22,-22),           (24,-22)
- (22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21)

Now, need the numbers at these positions.

Since the grid is fully filled up to 2025, and 2026 is placed, but neighbors may include numbers beyond or before.

All these positions are within the spiral up to at least 2026, but let's find the value at each (x,y).

A general formula for the number at (x,y) in this spiral is a bit involved, but since they are close, we can determine by which side they are on.

First, note the bounding box: layer 23 goes from x=-23 to 23, y=-23 to 23, but 2026 is early in the layer.

Let's identify each:

The right side of layer 23 is x=23, y from -22 up to 22 (that's 45 positions: y=-22 to 22).

Starts at (23,-22)=2026, then up: (23,-21)=2027, ..., up to (23,22)=2026 + 44 = 2070? y from -22 to 22 is 45 steps, but first is 2026, so last (23,22)=2026+44=2070.

Yes.

Then top side: from (22,23)=2071? After (23,22), next is left to (22,23)? No.

Standard: after right side up to (k, k-1)? For layer k=23, right side: x=k=23, y= -(k-1) to (k-1), i.e., y=-22 to 22, yes 45 numbers.

Then turns left: along top, y=23, x=22 down to -22? From after (23,22), next direction is left, so to (22,22)? No, to continue counterclockwise, from (23,22) moving left would be to (22,22), but actually the top side is y=k=23, x from k-1=22 down to -(k-1)=-22.

But from (23,22), to get to top side, actually the turn is after reaching the top of right side.

In standard spiral, after right side up to (k, k-1), next is left along y=k-1? I think I have the coordinates wrong.

Let's verify with small k.

For k=1: layer 1 starts after 1 at (0,0), right to (1,0)=2, up (1,1)=3, left (0,1)=4, left (-1,1)=5, down (-1,0)=6, down (-1,-1)=7, right (0,-1)=8, right (1,-1)=9.

9 at (1,-1), which is (k, -k) for k=1? (1,-1) yes.

For layer 2, starts after 9 (1,-1), right to (2,-1)=10.

Then up: (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13.

Then left: (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17.

Then down: (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21.

Then right: (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25.

Yes, 25 at (2,-2).

So pattern: for layer k, starts at (k, 1-k) = (k, -(k-1)), number n_{k-1} +1.

For k=2, (2, -1)=10=9+1.

For k=23, (23, -22)=2026=2025+1, yes.

Then moves up along x=23, y= -22 +1 = -21 up to y= k =23? For k=2, up from y=-1 to y=2: 11 at (2,0),12(2,1),13(2,2), so 3 steps up, to y=k.

General: up (2k-1) steps? For k=2, from y=-1, up 3 times to y=2.

Number of steps up: from y=-(k-1) to y=k, that's [k - (-(k-1))] = k + k-1 = 2k-1 steps up, but including start? No, the starting position is already placed, then move up 2k-1 times? For k=2: start (2,-1)=10, then move up 3 times: y=0,1,2 →11,12,13. Yes, 2*2-1=3.

But total on right side: 1 (start) + (2k-1) = 2k ? For k=2, 4, but actually right side has 4 numbers:10,11,12,13.

Yes.

For k=23, right side: start (23,-22)=2026, then up 45 times (2*23-1=45) to (23,23)=2026+45=2071.

y from -22 to 23: difference 23 - (-22)=45, so 46 positions? No:

Positions: y=-22 (1), then move up to y=-21 (2), ..., up to y=23 (46th).

Number of y values from -22 to 23 inclusive: 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46.

But earlier formula issue.

For k=2: y from -1 to 2: -1,0,1,2 →4 positions, 2 - (-1)+1=4=2k.

General: y from -(k-1) to k, number: k - (-(k-1)) +1 = k + k-1 +1 = 2k.

Yes, for k=23, 46 numbers on right side: 2026 to 2026+45=2071 at (23,23).

Yes.

Then, after (23,23), next direction is left, along the top side y=23, x from 22 down to -23.

From (23,23), move left to (22,23)=2072, then (21,23)=2073, ..., to (-23,23).

Number of steps left: from x=22 to x=-23, that's 22 - (-23) +1? Positions x=22 to -23: number is 22 - (-23) +1=46=2k.

But the first left move is the first of top side.

Total top side 2k numbers? For k=2: after (2,2)=13, left to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17. So x=1 to -2, 4 positions, yes 2k=4.

x from (k-1)=1 to -k=-2, number:1 - (-2)+1=4.

Yes, for k=23, top: x=22 to -23, y=23, 22 - (-23)+1=46 numbers, 2072 to 2072+45=2117 at (-23,23).

Then down along left side x=-23, y=22 down to -23, etc.

Now, back to neighbors of (23,-22):

List them and find which side they are on.

1. (22, -23): This is on the bottom side of layer 23? No, layer 23 bottom is y=-23, x from -22 to 23? Let's see.

Actually, since 2025 is at (22,-22), and before that, the bottom side of layer 22.

Layer 22 ends at (22,-22)=2025, and the bottom side of layer 22 is y=-22, x from -21 to 22? Let's find position (22,-23).

(22,-23) is inside layer 23? The max |coord| for layer 22 is 22, so (22,-23) has |y|=23, so it's in layer 23, on the bottom side.

The bottom side of layer 23 is after left and top, near the end.

To find the number at a general (x,y), one way is to determine the layer l = max(|x|,|y|), then see which side it's on, and compute the offset.

Yes, that's efficient.

For any (x,y) ≠ (0,0), let l = max(|x|, |y|).

Then the bottom-right corner of layer l is at (l, -l) = n_l = (2l +1)^2 ? No, as above, (l, -l) = n_l = (2l +1)^2 ? For l=1, (1,-1)=9=3^2 yes; l=2 (2,-2)=25=5^2 yes; general (2l+1)^2 yes.

Now, the four sides for layer l, starting from after n_{l-1}, but to find number at (x,y):

- If |x| = l and x > 0 (right side), then y goes from -(l-1) to l, number = n_{l-1} + (y - (-(l-1))) +1 ? Let's define.

The first in layer l: (l, -(l-1)) , number n_{l-1} +1

Then as y increases to l, number increases.

So for right side: x=l, y from -(l-1) to l, the index along side: y + (l-1) , from 0 to 2l.

Number = n_{l-1} + 1 + [y + (l-1)]

For l=2, n1=9, first (2,-1), index y +1 = -1+1=0, number=9+1+0=10 yes.

At y=2, 2+1=3, 9+1+3=13 yes.

Number of positions 2l=4, indices 0 to 3.

Yes, general: offset = y + (l-1), number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset.

Yes.

- Then top side: y = l, x from (l-1) down to -l.

First on top: after last right (l,l), next (l-1, l), offset from start of layer: 2l (full right side).

For l=2, after 13, (1,2)=14 =9+1 +4? 2l=4, yes 9+5=14? n_{l-1}+1 + (2l -1)? Wait.

Right side: 2l numbers, offsets 0 to 2l-1, numbers n_{l-1}+1 to n_{l-1}+2l.

Then top side starts at offset 2l, number n_{l-1} +1 +2l.

For l=2: 9+1+4=14 yes.

On top, x decreases from l-1 to -l, so offset along top: (l-1 - x)

For x=l-1, offset along top=0, total offset=2l +0

For x=-l, offset along top= (l-1 - (-l)) = l-1 +l =2l-1, total offset=2l + (2l-1)=4l -1, then number= n_{l-1} +1 +4l -1 = n_{l-1} + 4l = n_{l-1} + 8(l)/2 wait, anyway.

For l=2, at x=-2, offset along=1 - (-2)=3, total offset=4+3=7, number=9+1+7=17 yes.

Yes.

General for top: total offset = 2l + ( (l-1) - x )

Number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset

- Left side: x= -l, y from (l-1) down to -l.

First left: after last top (-l, l), next down to (-l, l-1)

So offset for first left: after top's 2l numbers, total offset 4l.

For l=2, top 4 numbers (14-17), then (-2,1)=18, offset 8? n1+1+8=18 yes, but 4l=8 yes.

Then y decreases from l-1 to -l, offset along left: (l-1 - y)

For y=l-1, 0; for y=-l, l-1 - (-l)=2l-1.

Yes, total offset= 4l + (l-1 - y)

For l=2, at y=1: 4*2 + (1-1)=8+0=8, num=9+1+8=18

At y=-2: 8 + (1 - (-2))=8+3=11, num=9+1+11=21 yes.

- Bottom side: y= -l, x from -(l-1) up to l. (increasing x)

First bottom: after last left (-l, -l), next right to (-l+1, -l)

Offset for first bottom: after left 2l numbers, total 6l.

For l=2, left 4 nums 18-21, then (-1,-2)=22, offset 12? 6*2=12, 9+1+12=22 yes.

Then x from -(l-1) to l, offset along bottom: x - (-(l-1)) = x + l -1

For x= -(l-1), 0; for x=l, l + l -1 =2l -1.

Yes, total offset=6l + (x + l -1)

For l=2, at x=-1: 12 + (-1 +2 -1)=12 +0=12, 22 yes

At x=2: 12 + (2+2-1)=12+3=15, num=9+1+15=25 yes.

Perfect.

Now, n_{l-1} = (2(l-1) +1 )^2 = (2l -1)^2

Yes.

Now, apply to each neighbor.

Position of 2026: (23,-22), l=23, right side, y=-22= -(23-1), offset= -22 +23-1= -22+22=0, num= n_{22} +1 +0=2025+1=2026 yes.

Now, the eight:

1. (22, -23): x=22, y=-23, l = max(22,23)=23

On bottom side? y=-23= -l, x=22, which is between -(23-1)=-22 and 23, yes bottom side.

So, offset = 6*23 + (22 + 23 -1) = 138 + (22+22)=138 +44=182

n_{22}=2025, num=2025 +1 +182=2025+183=2208

Is that right? Bottom side starts at offset 6l=138, num=2025+1+138=2164 at x=-22, y=-23

Then as x increases, offset increases, at x=23, y=-23 would be offset=138 + (23+22)=138+45=183, num=2025+1+183=2209, which is n_{23}=47^2=2209 yes.

So at x=22, offset=138 + (22+22)=138+44=182, num=2025+1+182=2208 yes.

2. (23, -23): x=23, y=-23, l=23

This is y=-l, x=l, so bottom side, x=23.

Offset=6*23 + (23 +23 -1)=138 +45=183, num=2025+1+183=2209

Yes, the last number.

3. (24, -23): x=24, y=-23, l=max(24,23)=24 >23, but the spiral hasn't reached layer 24 yet. The grid is infinite, but numbers are only placed up to 2026? No, the problem says "the natural numbers are written on a spiral", implying all natural numbers are placed, continuing the spiral indefinitely.

So yes, we need to continue to layer 24 to find numbers there.

The neighbors include positions in layer 24.

For (24,-23): l=24, now need to find its number.

Layer 24 starts after n_{23}=2209, first number 2210 at (24, -(24-1))=(24,-23)

Yes! Exactly the starting position of layer 24: (24,-23)=2210

Perfect.

4. (22, -22): This is the center one? No, (22,-22)=2025, as we know, the end of layer 22.

But to confirm with formula: l=max(22,22)=22, now which side? x=22=l, y=-22=-l, but for right side of layer 22? Right side for l=22: x=22, y from -21 to 22.

y=-22 is not on right side of 22.

Actually, (22,-22) is the bottom-right corner, which is the last of the bottom side of layer 22.

For layer 22, bottom side: y=-22, x from -21 to 22.

Yes, x=22 is the last one.

Using formula for l=22, bottom: offset=6*22 + (22 +22 -1)=132 +43=175

n_{21}=(2*21 +1)^2=43^2=1849

Num=1849 +1 +175=1849+176=2025 yes.

Good.

5. (24, -22): x=24, y=-22, l=24

On right side of layer 24: x=24, y from -23 to 24.

y=-22 = -23 +1, so first move up from start.

Start (24,-23)=2210, offset 0 for layer 24.

Then offset = y + (24-1) = y +23

For y=-23, -23+23=0, yes.

For y=-22, -22+23=1, so num= n_{23} +1 +1=2209 +2=2211

Yes.

6. (22, -21): x=22, y=-21, l=22 (max=22)

For layer 22, right side: x=22, y from -21 to 22.

Yes, y=-21 is the first on right side of 22? For l=22, right side starts at y= -(22-1)=-21, yes (22,-21)= n_{21} +1

n_{21}=1849, +1=1850

Offset= y + (22-1)= -21 +21=0, num=1849+1+0=1850 yes.

Is that correct? Actually, layer 22 starts at (22, -21)= n_{21}+1=1850, then up to (22,22), etc., and ends at bottom (22,-22)=2025.

Yes, but (22,-22) is not on right side, as we saw.

But for (22,-21), yes 1850.

From 2025 at (22,-22), the previous number before starting layer 22? No, layer 22 starts at 1850 (22,-21), but how does it reach (22,-22)?

No: the bottom side of 22 is before the end.

Anyway, formula gave 1850, but is that right?

Let's think: the end of layer 21 is at (21,-21)= n_{21}=1849.

Then layer 22 starts right to (22,-21)=1850.

Then up along right: (22,-20)=1851, ..., up to (22,22)=1850 + (22 - (-21)) = wait, y from -21 to 22: 22 - (-21)+1=44=2*22.

Yes, (22,22)=1850+43=1893.

Then top y=22, x=21 to -22, etc.

Then eventually bottom y=-22, x=-21 to 22: the numbers there are near the end.

Specifically, the last is (22,-22)=2025.

Now, where is (22,-21)? It's the start of the right side, 1850, yes.

But (22,-21) is above (22,-22), but in the spiral path, (22,-22) is placed much later, after going around.

Yes, that's fine, the positions are filled in order, but the coordinate (22,-21) gets 1850, yes.

7. (23, -21): x=23=l=23, y=-21, right side of 23.

Offset= y + (23-1) = -21 +22=1, num=2025 +1 +1=2027

Yes, as expected, next after 2026.

8. (24, -21): x=24, y=-21, l=24, right side.

Offset= y +23= -21 +23=2, num=2209 +1 +2=2212

Yes.

Now, the eight neighbors' numbers:

- (22,-23): 2208

- (23,-23): 2209

- (24,-23): 2210

- (22,-22): 2025

- (24,-22): 2211

- (22,-21): 1850

- (23,-21): 2027

- (24,-21): 2212

Sum: Let's add them up.

First, the layer 22 ones: 2025 + 1850 = 3875

Layer 23: 2208 + 2209 + 2027 = 2208+2209=4417, +2027=6444

Layer 24: 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 2210+2212=4422, +2211=6633

Now total: 3875 + 6444 = 10319

10319 + 6633 = 16952

So the sum is 16952.<|control12|>16952

## Explanation

The reasoning begins by locating 2026 in the Ulam spiral, which starts at 1 in the center (0,0) and expands counterclockwise. The largest number in layer k is (2k+1)^2. For 2025 = 45^2, it is in layer 22 at position (22, -22). Thus, 2026, the first number in layer 23, is at (23, -22).

The eight neighboring positions are: (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23), (22, -22), (24, -22), (22, -21), (23, -21), and (24, -21). Each position's number is determined using the layer l = max(|x|, |y|) and the side of the layer.

- For a position in layer l, the base is n_{l-1} = (2(l-1) + 1)^2.
- Right side (x = l, y from -(l-1) to l): offset = y + (l-1), number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset.
- Top side (y = l, x from l-1 to -l): offset = 2l + ((l-1) - x), number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset.
- Left side (x = -l, y from l-1 to -l): offset = 4l + ((l-1) - y), number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset.
- Bottom side (y = -l, x from -(l-1) to l): offset = 6l + (x + l - 1), number = n_{l-1} + 1 + offset.

Applying this:
- (22, -23): Layer 23, bottom side; offset = 6×23 + (22 + 23 - 1) = 182; number = 2025 + 1 + 182 = 2208.
- (23, -23): Layer 23, bottom side; offset = 183; number = 2209.
- (24, -23): Layer 24, right side; offset = 0; number = 2209 + 1 = 2210.
- (22, -22): Layer 22, bottom side; offset = 175; number = 1849 + 1 + 175 = 2025.
- (24, -22): Layer 24, right side; offset = 1; number = 2211.
- (22, -21): Layer 22, right side; offset = 0; number = 1849 + 1 = 1850.
- (23, -21): Layer 23, right side; offset = 1; number = 2027.
- (24, -21): Layer 24, right side; offset = 2; number = 2212.

Summing these numbers: 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 16952.
