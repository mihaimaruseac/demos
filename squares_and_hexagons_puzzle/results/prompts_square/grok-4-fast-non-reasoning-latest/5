To determine the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, first identify its position. The spiral starts at (0,0) with 1 and proceeds counterclockwise: right to 2 at (1,0), up to 3 at (1,1), left to 4 at (0,1) and 5 at (-1,1), down to 6 at (-1,0) and 7 at (-1,-1), right to 8 at (0,-1) and 9 at (1,-1), and so on.

The positions of numbers \(n = (2k+1)^2\) (ends of layers) are at \((k, -k)\). For \(n\) between \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) and \((2k+1)^2\), the layer is \(k\), and the position depends on the side:

- Right side (\(y = -k\)): \(x = k - (n - (2k-1)^2 - 1)\)
- Top side (\(x = -k\)): \(y = k - (n - (2k+1)^2 + 4k - 1)\)
- Left side (\(x = -k\)): \(y = -k + (n - (2k+3)^2 + 4k + 1)\)
- Bottom side (\(y = k\)): \(x = -k + ((2k+3)^2 - n)\)

For 2026, \(k = 22\) (since \(43^2 = 1849 < 2026 < 2025 = 45^2\)). It lies on the right side: \(x = 22 - (2026 - 1849 - 1) = 0\), \(y = -22\). Thus, 2026 is at (0, -22).

Its eight neighbors are at relative positions (±1, 0), (0, ±1), (±1, ±1). Their values are found using the layer and side formulas, yielding: 1849, 1850, 1987, 1988, 2025, 2027, 2063, 2064.

Sum: 1849 + 1850 + 1987 + 1988 + 2025 + 2027 + 2063 + 2064 = 16033.
