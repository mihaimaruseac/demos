To solve this, first determine the position of 2026 in the Ulam spiral. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and proceeds counterclockwise: right to 2, down to 3, left to 4 and 5, up to 6 and 7, right to 8–10, and so on, forming layers around the center.

The layer \(k\) (starting with \(k=0\) for the center) has side length \(2k+1\) and contains \(8k\) numbers (for \(k \geq 1\)). The largest number in layer \(k\) is \((2k+1)^2\).

Solve \((2k+1)^2 \geq 2026\):
- \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.02\), so \(k=22\) (since \(2 \cdot 22 + 1 = 45\), \(45^2 = 2025\); \(47^2 = 2209\)).
- 2026 is the first number in layer 23 (\(k=23\)), at position (23, -22) if the center 1 is at (0,0), with x increasing right and y increasing up.

The 8 neighbors are at relative positions: (0,-1), (0,1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1), (-1,1).

Their values are:
- (23, -23): 2025
- (23, -21): 2027
- (24, -22): 2069
- (22, -22): 1983
- (24, -23): 2068
- (24, -21): 2070
- (22, -23): 1982
- (22, -21): 1984

Sum: 2025 + 2027 + 2069 + 1983 + 2068 + 1982 + 1984 + 2070 = 16208.
