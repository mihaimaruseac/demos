To solve this, first determine the position of 2026 in the Ulam spiral. The spiral starts at 1 in the center and proceeds counterclockwise: right to 2, down to 3, left to 4 and 5, up to 6 and 7, right to 8–10, and so on, forming layers around the center.

The layer \(k\) (starting with \(k=0\) for the center) has side length \(2k+1\) and contains \(8k\) numbers (for \(k \geq 1\)). The largest number in layer \(k\) is \((2k+1)^2\).

Solve \((2k+1)^2 \geq 2026\):
- \(\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01\), so \(k=22\) (since \(2 \cdot 22 + 1 = 45\), \(45^2 = 2025\)) and \(k=23\) (\(47^2 = 2209\)).
- 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

Layer 23 starts at (22, -22) with 2026 (using center at (0,0), x right, y up). It proceeds right along the bottom side of the layer:
- Positions: (22, -22) = 2026, (23, -22) = 2027, ..., (45, -22) = 2048.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at (22, -22) are:
- (21, -22) = 2025 (end of layer 22),
- (22, -23) = 2050 (from left side: 2049 at (22, -23) +1? Wait, correction via pattern),
- Wait, precise: bottom side starts after left side ends at 2049 (22,-23), but start is post-up side.

Correct path for layer 23:
- Up side: from (22,-22) up to (22,23), numbers 2026 to 2068,
No—standard Ulam: after 2025 at (22,-22)? Standard position for n= (2k+1)^2 is bottom-right (k,-k).

For k=22, 2025 at (22,-22). Then layer 23:
- Right from (22,-22) to (23,-22)=2026? No.

Standard Ulam spiral direction is east from 1, then north, west, south, expanding.

Position formula:
For n >0, find k = ceil( (sqrt(n)-1)/2 ), then position within layer.

For 2026 = 2025 +1 = 45^2 +1, in standard Ulam, from bottom-right (22,-22)=2025, next is up to (22,-21)=2026.

Yes: after south to bottom-right, next direction is west? No.

Let's clarify the spiral path:
- 1 at (0,0).
- Right (east): (
