To determine the sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, first identify its position. The spiral starts at (0,0) with 1 and proceeds counterclockwise: right to 2 at (1,0), up to 3 at (1,1), left to 4 at (0,1) and 5 at (-1,1), down to 6 at (-1,0) and 7 at (-1,-1), right to 8 at (0,-1) and 9 at (1,-1), and so on.

The positions of numbers up to 2025 form complete layers (rings) up to layer \(k=22\) (where layer \(k\) covers numbers from \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2k+1)^2\)). The largest number in layer 22 is \(45^2 = 2025\) at \((22, -22)\). Thus, 2026 is the first number in layer 23, placed immediately after 2025 by moving up, so 2026 is at \((22, -21)\).

The eight neighbors are at:
- \((23, -21)\): 2047
- \((23, -22)\): 2046
- \((22, -22)\): 2025
- \((21, -22)\): 2024
- \((21, -21)\): 2003
- \((21, -20)\): 2002
- \((22, -20)\): 2004
- \((23, -20)\): 2027

Their sum is \(2047 + 2046 + 2025 + 2024 + 2003 + 2002 + 2004 + 2027 = 16178\).
