Solution:
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. We need to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

First, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral. The spiral is constructed in layers, where the $k$-th layer (for $k \ge 1$) is a square ring of side length $2k+1$. The largest number in the $(k-1)$-th layer is $(2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2$. The largest number in the $k$-th layer is $(2k+1)^2$, which is the bottom-right corner of the square of size $(2k+1) \times (2k+1)$.

We find the smallest integer $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 \ge 2026$.
Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, we look for $2k-1$:
If $2k-1 = 43$, then $(2k-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$.
If $2k-1 = 45$, then $(2k-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.

The number 2025 is the largest number in the square of side length $2k+1 = 45$, so $2k+1 = 45$, which means $2k = 44$, so $k=22$.
The layer containing 2026 is the $k=23$ layer, which is the ring immediately outside the $45 \times 45$ square. The $45 \times 45$ square has its bottom-right corner at $45^2 = 2025$.

Let $N = 2026$. The number $N$ is in the ring $R_{23}$, which is the layer outside the $45 \times 45$ square. The side length of this square is $s = 2(23)+1 = 47$. The largest number in the previous layer is $45^2 = 2025$.

The corner numbers of the $45 \times 45$ square are:
Bottom-right (BR): $45^2 = 2025$.
Bottom-left (BL): $2025 - 44 = 1981$. (The side length is 45, so there are 44 steps in each side).
Top-left (TL): $1981 - 44 = 1937$.
Top-right (TR): $1937 - 44 = 1893$.

The number 2026 is in the next ring, which has side length 47. The side length of the square is $s = 2k+1 = 47$, so $k=23$. The previous largest number is $45^2 = 2025$.

The numbers in the $47 \times 47$ square go from $46^2+1 = 2117$ to $47^2 = 2209$.
The path of the spiral is as follows:
The number $45^2 = 2025$ is at the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The next number, $2026$, moves up one step from 2025.
The coordinates are relative to the center $(0,0)$ where 1 is located.
The number $n^2$ is at $(n/2, -n/2)$ if $n$ is odd.
For $n=45$, $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.

The numbers in the $47 \times 47$ square are from $2026$ to $47^2 = 2209$.
The number 2025 is at the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The spiral moves up from 2025.
Position of 2025: $(22, -22)$.
2026 is one step up: $(22, -21)$. This is on the right edge.
The right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square goes from $y=-23$ to $y=23$.
The right edge is where $x=23$. Wait, the $45 \times 45$ square goes from $x=-22$ to $x=22$ and $y=-22$ to $y=22$.
The $47 \times 47$ square goes from $x=-23$ to $x=23$ and $y=-23$ to $y=23$.

The number 2025 is at the bottom-right corner $(22, -22)$.
The spiral moves up along the right edge:
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
...
The number at the top-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square is $1893$.
The path from 1893 to 2025 is along the top, left, and bottom sides.
Top side: $1893$ (TR) to $1937$ (TL), a length of 44 steps. $1893 + 44 = 1937$.
Left side: $1937$ (TL) to $1981$ (BL), a length of 44 steps. $1937 + 44 = 1981$.
Bottom side: $1981$ (BL) to $2025$ (BR), a length of 44 steps. $1981 + 44 = 2025$.

From 2025, the spiral moves up along the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square has $x=23$. The $y$-coordinates range from $-23$ to $23$.
The position of 2025 is $(22, -22)$. The next position is $(22, -21)$ if the spiral continues in the same direction, but it turns outwards.

The path is:
2025 at $(22, -22)$.
2026 moves up one step to $(22, -21)$. This is incorrect based on the standard Ulam spiral where the turn is at the corners.

Let's trace the $47 \times 47$ layer, starting from $45^2+1 = 2026$.
The side length of the new layer is $s = 47$. The difference in max value is $47^2 - 45^2 = 2209 - 2025 = 184$. This is the length of the 4 sides, $4 \times (47-1) = 4 \times 46 = 184$. No, the side length is 47, so there are 46 steps between corners.

The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square:
Bottom-right (BR): $47^2 = 2209$.
Bottom-left (BL): $2209 - 46 = 2163$.
Top-left (TL): $2163 - 46 = 2117$.
Top-right (TR): $2117 - 46 = 2071$.

The sequence of numbers on this outer layer starts at $45^2+1 = 2026$.
The number $45^2 = 2025$ is at the BR corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The spiral moves from 2025 by turning left (up) one position to start the new layer.
The path direction for the $k$-th layer (side $2k+1$) goes: Up, Left, Down, Right.
For $k=23$, side length $47$. The numbers go from $45^2+1 = 2026$ to $47^2 = 2209$.

The movement from $45^2$ to $46^2+1 = 2117$:
The path of the layer $k=23$ (size $47 \times 47$) starts by moving Up from 2025.
2025 is at the BR of $45 \times 45$.
The $47 \times 47$ square has side length 47. The corners of this square are at $y = \pm 23, x = \pm 23$.
The number $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The spiral moves to $(22, -21), (22, -20), \dots, (22, 23)$ (Top-right corner of the inner square, one step outside).
This is not the standard Ulam spiral. Let's use the known structure.

The number $n^2$ for odd $n$ is at the bottom-right corner. $45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The next number $2026$ moves up. The side length of the new layer is $s=47$. The distance to the new edge is $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps up to $y=23$. This is too many steps.

Let's use the known positions of the corners of the $m \times m$ square where $m=2k+1$.
$m=45$, $k=22$. $45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The next layer has size $47 \times 47$, $k=23$. The positions are from $-23$ to $23$.
The number $2026$ starts the new layer by moving up one step from $2025$.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
The path is Up, Left, Down, Right.
The number $47^2=2209$ is at the BR corner $(23, -23)$.

The path from 2025:
The side length of the ring is $46$. The path goes up $46$ steps to reach the top boundary.
2025 at $(22, -22)$.
The right boundary of the $47 \times 47$ square is $x=23$. The top is $y=23$.
The spiral moves up from 2025 to $y=23$:
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The number of steps needed to reach the top edge $y=23$ while staying on $x=22$ is $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps. This is not right.

The path moves from $45^2$ to $45^2+1$ by turning "outward".
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The next number $2026$ is at $(22, -21)$. The spiral moves up from 2025.
The right edge of the new square has $x=23$.
The path goes up from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 23)$ (23 - (-22) = 45 steps). This is too many steps.

The path goes along the new layer, which has side length $47$. The length of each segment is $46$.
The first segment is on the right side, moving up. It has length $46$.
The segment starts just outside 2025.
2025 is at $(22, -22)$.
The path moves up along $x=22$ to $(22, 23)$? No.

The number $45^2=2025$ is at $P_{45} = (22, -22)$.
The next layer starts at $2026$. The new coordinates are from $-23$ to $23$.
The movement from $45^2$ to $46^2+1$ is a turn.
The path segment is along $x=23$ from $y=-23$ to $y=23$. The length is $46$.
The corner $47^2=2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.
The path is: $2209 \to 2208 \to \dots \to 2163 \to \dots \to 2117 \to \dots \to 2071 \to \dots \to 2026$.
The $47 \times 47$ square has corners:
BR: $47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
BL: $2163$ at $(-23, -23)$.
TL: $2117$ at $(-23, 23)$.
TR: $2071$ at $(23, 23)$.

The number 2026 is on the right edge, moving up from 2025, but the sequence starts at 2026.
The path is Right, Up, Left, Down.
The number $45^2=2025$ is on the right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The next number $2026$ is one step to the right: $(23, -22)$. This is the start of the right segment.
The right segment goes from $y=-23$ to $y=23$ (length 46).

$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
The path moves up along $x=23$:
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$.
...
The top point of this segment is at $y=23$. The number of steps is $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps from 2026.
The number at $y=23$ is $2026 + 45 = 2071$. This is the TR corner.
So, 2026 is $45$ positions away from 2071, moving down.

Position of 2026: $x=23$. $y$-coordinate is $y_N$.
$y_{2071} = 23$.
The sequence of $y$ values is $-22, -21, \dots, 23$.
$y_N = -22 + (2026 - 2026) = -22$. Wait, $2026$ is the first number.
The position of $2026$ is $(23, -22)$.

The neighbors of 2026 at $(23, -22)$ are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -23)$: Bottom-Left neighbor.
    \item $(22, -22)$: The number 2025.
    \item $(22, -21)$: Top-Left neighbor.
    \item $(23, -23)$: Bottom neighbor. (This is $2025-1$ if we go counter-clockwise, but this number is on the new layer).
    \item $(23, -21)$: Top neighbor.
    \item $(24, -23)$: Not in the $47 \times 47$ grid. The $47 \times 47$ grid is from $-23$ to $23$.
    \item $(24, -22)$: Not in the $47 \times 47$ grid.
    \item $(24, -21)$: Not in the $47 \times 47$ grid.
\end{itemize}
The neighbors of 2026 at $(23, -22)$ are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23)$
    \item $(22, -22) \implies 2025$
    \item $(22, -21)$
    \item $(23, -23)$
    \item $(23, -21)$
    \item $(24, -23)$
    \item $(24, -22)$
    \item $(24, -21)$
\end{enumerate}
The neighbors must be within the area covered by the spiral. The number 2026 is an "outer" number, so some neighbors might not exist if the grid was truncated. Since the problem implies a standard infinite square grid, we consider all 8 neighbors.

The neighbors are:
1. $(22, -23)$: This point is on the $45 \times 45$ square boundary or inside. The $45 \times 45$ square is $x, y \in \{-22, \dots, 22\}$. This point is outside the $45 \times 45$ square, on the boundary of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The $47 \times 47$ square has indices $x, y \in \{-23, \dots, 23\}$.
The neighbor $(22, -23)$ is on the bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square, at $y=-23$.
The bottom edge runs from $(-23, -23)$ to $(23, -23)$.
The numbers on the bottom edge: $2163$ (BL) to $2209$ (BR).
$2163$ at $(-23, -23)$. $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
The equation of the bottom edge ($y=-23$) from right to left: $x$ goes from $23$ down to $-23$.
$2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
$2208$ at $(22, -23)$.
$2207$ at $(21, -23)$.
...
The number at $(22, -23)$ is $2209 - (23-22) = 2209 - 1 = 2208$. This is incorrect.
The position of $2209$ is $(23, -23)$. Moving left (decreasing $x$):
$2208$ is at $(22, -23)$.
$2207$ is at $(21, -23)$.
The number at $(22, -23)$ is $2208$.

2. $(22, -22) \implies 2025$.

3. $(22, -21)$: This point is inside the $45 \times 45$ square. The number at $(22, -21)$ is on the right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square, moving up from 2025.
The right edge of $45 \times 45$ square runs from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 22)$.
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2024$ at $(22, -21)$. (Since $2025$ is BR corner, the path before that was up).
The path for the $45 \times 45$ layer: $2025$ (BR) $\to 2024$ (up) $\to \dots \to 1893$ (TR).
So, $(22, -21) \implies 2024$.

4. $(23, -23) \implies 2209$.

5. $(23, -21)$: This point is on the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square, moving up from 2026.
$2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
$2027$ at $(23, -21)$.

6. $(24, -23)$: This point is outside the $47 \times 47$ square. We assume the spiral continues on the grid.
The next layer is $49 \times 49$. $49^2 = 2401$.
The point $(23, -23)$ is the corner $2209$. The next layer starts at $2210$.
The point $(24, -23)$ would be on the bottom edge of the $49 \times 49$ square.
The bottom edge of $49 \times 49$ is $y=-24$. This point is not on the bottom edge.

The neighbors are relative to the grid point $(23, -22)$.
The neighboring grid points are:
$(22, -23), (22, -22), (22, -21)$
$(23, -23), \quad \quad (23, -21)$
$(24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)$

We need the values at these 8 points.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N(22, -22) = 2025$.
    \item $N(22, -21) = 2024$ (Right edge of $45 \times 45$, moving up).
    \item $N(22, -23)$: This point is outside the $45 \times 45$ square, but inside the $47 \times 47$ square. It is on the bottom edge $y=-23$.
    The bottom edge from right to left: $2209$ at $(23, -23)$, $2208$ at $(22, -23)$. So, $N(22, -23) = 2208$.
    \item $N(23, -23) = 2209$.
    \item $N(23, -21) = 2027$ (Right edge of $47 \times 47$, moving up from 2026).
    \item $N(24, -23), N(24, -22), N(24, -21)$: These points are in the next layer, the $49 \times 49$ square, whose coordinates range from $-24$ to $24$.
    The $47 \times 47$ square ends at $x=23, y=23$. The next layer starts at $47^2+1 = 2210$.
    The $49 \times 49$ square goes from $2210$ to $49^2=2401$.
    The path of the $49 \times 49$ layer starts by moving right from $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
    $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
    $2210$ at $(24, -23)$.
    $2211$ at $(24, -22)$.
    $2212$ at $(24, -21)$.
\end{itemize}

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at $(23, -22)$ are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23) \implies 2208$
    \item $(22, -22) \implies 2025$
    \item $(22, -21) \implies 2024$
    \item $(23, -23) \implies 2209$
    \item $(23, -21) \implies 2027$
    \item $(24, -23) \implies 2210$
    \item $(24, -22) \implies 2211$
    \item $(24, -21) \implies 2212$
\end{enumerate}

The sum $S$ is:
$S = 2208 + 2025 + 2024 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$
$S = (2025 + 2024 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)$
$S = 6076 + (5 \times 2210)$
$S = 6076 + 11050$
$S = 17126$.

Final check of the neighbors of $N=2026$:
$N$ is at $(23, -22)$.
The 8 neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N-1 = 2025$ at $(22, -22)$. (Left)
    \item $N+1 = 2027$ at $(23, -21)$. (Up)
    \item $N-2 = 2024$ at $(22, -21)$. (Up-Left)
    \item $N+45 = 2071$ at $(23, 23)$.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors of a point $(x, y)$ are $(x\pm 1, y\pm 1), (x\pm 1, y), (x, y\pm 1)$.
If the neighbors $N_i$ are $N \pm d_i$, then the sum is $8N + \sum (\pm d_i)$.

The neighbors' values relative to 2026:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2025 = 2026 - 1$. (Left)
    \item $2024 = 2026 - 2$. (Up-Left)
    \item $2208$: $(22, -23)$.
    $2209 = 2026 + 183$. $2208 = 2209 - 1$.
    The difference $2208 - 2026 = 182$. (Down-Left)
    \item $2209 = 2026 + 183$. (Down)
    \item $2210 = 2026 + 184$. (Down-Right)
    \item $2211 = 2026 + 185$. (Right)
    \item $2212 = 2026 + 186$. (Up-Right)
    \item $2027 = 2026 + 1$. (Up)
\end{itemize}

Sum of differences:
$-1 - 2 + 182 + 183 + 184 + 185 + 186 + 1 = 183 + 184 + 185 + 186 - 2$
$183+184+185+186 = 738$.
Sum of differences $= 738 - 2 = 736$.

The sum is $8 \times 2026 + 736$.
$8 \times 2026 = 16208$.
$S = 16208 + 736 = 16944$.

Let's recheck the calculated values:
$2208 + 2025 + 2024 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 17126$.

Re-summing the differences:
$-1 - 2 = -3$
$+182 + 183 + 184 + 185 + 186 + 1 = 738 + 1 = 739$. (There are 6 positive differences, 2 negative)
The differences are:
$-1$ (2025)
$-2$ (2024)
$+182$ (2208)
$+183$ (2209)
$+184$ (2210)
$+185$ (2211)
$+186$ (2212)
$+1$ (2027)
Sum of differences: $-3 + (182 + 183 + 184 + 185 + 186 + 1) = -3 + 921 = 918$.

$S = 8 \times 2026 + 918 = 16208 + 918 = 17126$.

The two methods yield the same result.
