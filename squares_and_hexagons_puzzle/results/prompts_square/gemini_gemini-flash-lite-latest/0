Solution:
The numbers are written on a square grid in a spiral pattern starting from 1 at the center. The spiral expands in layers. The side length of the square formed by the numbers up to $n^2$ is $2n-1$. The last number in a square of size $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ is $(2k-1)^2$.

We first find the layer in which the number $N = 2026$ lies. We look for $k$ such that $(2k-3)^2 < 2026 \le (2k-1)^2$.
We find the largest odd square less than or equal to 2026:
$40^2 = 1600$
$45^2 = 2025$
$46^2 = 2116$

Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2025 is the corner of a square. Let $2k-1 = 45$, so $2k = 46$, and $k = 23$.
The square of size $45 \times 45$ ends at $45^2 = 2025$.
The center of the grid is 1. The side length of the square ending at $m^2$ is $m$, where $m$ is odd.
Let $m = 2k-1$. The square ends at $(2k-1)^2$.
For $m=45$, $k=23$. The number $45^2 = 2025$ is at the corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.

The structure of the spiral suggests that the corner of the square of size $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ is $(2k-1)^2$.
The corners of the $n \times n$ square (where $n=2k-1$) are:
Top-right: $(2k-1)^2$
Top-left: $(2k-1)^2 - (2k-2)$
Bottom-left: $(2k-1)^2 - 2(2k-2)$
Bottom-right: $(2k-1)^2 - 3(2k-2)$

For $2025 = 45^2$, we have $2k-1 = 45$, so $2k-2 = 44$.
The corners of the $45 \times 45$ square are:
Top-right (TR): $2025$
Top-left (TL): $2025 - 44 = 1981$
Bottom-left (BL): $2025 - 2(44) = 2025 - 88 = 1937$
Bottom-right (BR): $2025 - 3(44) = 2025 - 132 = 1893$

The number $2026$ is $2025 + 1$. Since $2025$ is the top-right corner, the sequence continues from $2025$ upwards to the next layer.
The next layer is formed by numbers from $2026$ up to $47^2 = 2209$. The side length of this new square is $47$.
The number $2025$ is at position $(23, 23)$ if the center is $(1, 1)$ and the coordinates go up to $23$. More precisely, if we use coordinates relative to the center $(0,0)$, the vertices of the $45 \times 45$ square are at $(\pm 22, \pm 22)$.
The side length is $2(k-1)+1 = 2(22)+1 = 45$. The coordinates are from $-22$ to $22$.
The number $2025 = 45^2$ is at the top-right corner, position $(22, 22)$.

The next number, $2026$, is the start of the next segment moving left from the top-right corner.
The sequence of numbers in the outer layer (the $47 \times 47$ square) starts at $45^2+1 = 2026$ and ends at $47^2 = 2209$.
The side length of the outer layer is $47$. The maximum coordinate distance from the center is $23$.
The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square are:
TR: $47^2 = 2209$
TL: $2209 - 46 = 2163$
BL: $2209 - 2(46) = 2209 - 92 = 2117$
BR: $2209 - 3(46) = 2209 - 138 = 2071$

The path of the spiral in the outermost layer ($47 \times 47$ square) is:
Starts from $45^2+1 = 2026$ at position $(22, 23)$ (if $2025$ is $(22, 22)$ and the direction is up).
Let's analyze the position of $2025$. It is the $TR$ corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The spiral moves outward from the center: Right, Up, Left, Down, Right, ...
1 is at (0,0).
2 is at (1,0). (1 step right)
3 is at (1,1). (1 step up)
4 is at (0,1). (1 step left)
5 is at (-1,1). (1 step left)
6 is at (-1,0). (1 step down)
7 is at (-1,-1). (1 step down)
8 is at (0,-1). (1 step right)
9 is at (1,-1). (1 step right)
The $m \times m$ square has $m=2k-1$. The max coordinate is $k-1$.
For $m=3$ ($k=2$): max coord $1$. $9$ is at $(1, -1)$. This is BR.
For $m=5$ ($k=3$): max coord $2$. $25$ is at $(2, 2)$. This is TR.
$25 = 5^2$. $24$ is at $(2, 1)$. $23$ is at $(2, 0)$. $22$ is at $(2, -1)$. $21$ is at $(2, -2)$. $20$ is at $(1, -2)$. $19$ is at $(0, -2)$. $18$ is at $(-1, -2)$. $17$ is at $(-2, -2)$. $16$ is at $(-2, -1)$. $15$ is at $(-2, 0)$. $14$ is at $(-2, 1)$. $13$ is at $(-2, 2)$. $12$ is at $(-1, 2)$. $11$ is at $(0, 2)$. $10$ is at $(1, 2)$.

The corners of the $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ square:
TR: $(k-1, k-1)$ at $(2k-1)^2$. Here $k=23$, $2k-1=45$. $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.

The next number, $2026$, is outside the $45 \times 45$ square, so it is in the $47 \times 47$ square.
The spiral moves from $2025$ (TR) by moving up one step.
Position of $2025$: $(22, 22)$.
Position of $2026$: $(22, 23)$. (Up)
The next numbers move left until the TL corner.
The side length of the new layer is 47, max coordinate is 23.
The path in the new layer goes from $(22, 23)$ to $(-23, 23)$ (TL), then to $(-23, -23)$ (BL), then to $(23, -23)$ (BR), and finally to $(23, 23)$ (TR of the next square, which is $47^2$). Wait, the $47^2$ corner is $(23, 23)$.

The path of the $47 \times 47$ square ($2026$ to $2209$):
Start of the layer: $2026$ is at $(22, 23)$.
The TL corner is $2163$ at $(-23, 23)$. The path is along the top edge, moving left.
The distance from $(22, 23)$ to $(-23, 23)$ is $22 - (-23) = 45$ steps.
The number of steps taken is $2163 - 2026 = 137$. This is incorrect.

The numbers on the $m \times m$ square (where $m=2k-1$):
TR is $m^2$ at $(k-1, k-1)$.
The side length of the new layer is $m+2 = 47$. The new max coordinate is $k = 23$.

Number $N$ is at position $(x, y)$.
The location of $2025 = 45^2$ is $(22, 22)$.
The next number $2026$ is one step up: $(22, 23)$. This is on the boundary of the next square.
The path continues left along the top edge:
$2026$ at $(22, 23)$
$2027$ at $(21, 23)$
...
The TL corner is at $(-23, 23)$, which is $2163$.
The number of steps from $2026$ to $2163$ is $2163 - 2026 = 137$.
The number of steps along the edge from $x=22$ to $x=-23$ is $22 - (-23) = 45$ steps.

Let's verify the position of $2163$. It is the TL corner of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The distance from TR ($47^2 = 2209$) to TL is $46$. $2209 - 46 = 2163$. Correct.
The coordinates of the corners of the $47 \times 47$ square (max coordinate 23):
TR: $(23, 23)$ at $2209$.
TL: $(-23, 23)$ at $2163$.
BL: $(-23, -23)$ at $2117$.
BR: $(23, -23)$ at $2071$.

The spiral path in this layer:
It starts one step "above" the $45^2$ TR corner, i.e., at $(22, 23)$.
The starting number of the $47 \times 47$ layer is $45^2+1 = 2026$.
Since $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$ (TR), the path moves up to $(22, 23)$, then left.
$2026$ is at $(22, 23)$.

The coordinates of $2026$ are $(x, y) = (22, 23)$.
The neighbors of $2026$ are the numbers at positions $(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y)$ where $\Delta x, \Delta y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $(\Delta x, \Delta y) \ne (0, 0)$.
The neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(21, 24)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ square, must be in the $49 \times 49$ layer.
    \item $(22, 24)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ square.
    \item $(23, 24)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ square.
    \item $(21, 23)$: $2027$ (moving left)
    \item $(23, 23)$: $2209$ (TR corner of $47 \times 47$ square is $2209$, this should be an earlier number if the path is correct)
\end{itemize}

Let's re-examine the path from $2025$. $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.
The path must be: Up $\to$ Left $\to$ Down $\to$ Right.
The last segment of the $45 \times 45$ square is the right side, going from $1893$ (BR at $(22, -22)$) up to $2025$ (TR at $(22, 22)$).
The step before $2025$: $2024$ at $(22, 21)$.
The next number $2025$ is the corner, so the direction changes for the next layer.

The next layer starts at $2026$. The direction changes to UP.
$2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.
$2026$ is at $(22, 23)$. (Up, first step in the new layer)
The next step is Left to the TL corner $(-23, 23)$, which is $2163$.
The next step is Down to the BL corner $(-23, -23)$, which is $2117$.
The next step is Right to the BR corner $(23, -23)$, which is $2071$.
The next step is Up to the TR corner $(23, 23)$, which is $2209$.

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, 23)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\mathbf{21}, \mathbf{23})$: Moving left, this is $2027$.
    \item $(\mathbf{23}, \mathbf{23})$: Moving right, this is the TR corner of the $47 \times 47$ square, $2209$. (Wait, the next number after $2026$ is $2027$ moving left, so $2209$ must be at the end of the next full circuit.)
    \item $(\mathbf{22}, \mathbf{22})$: The number below, which is $2025$.
    \item $(\mathbf{21}, \mathbf{22})$: Diagonal. This number is in the $45 \times 45$ square.
    \item $(\mathbf{23}, \mathbf{22})$: Diagonal. This number is in the $45 \times 45$ square.
    \item $(\mathbf{21}, \mathbf{24})$: Next layer.
    \item $(\mathbf{22}, \mathbf{24})$: Next layer.
    \item $(\mathbf{23}, \mathbf{24})$: Next layer.
\end{enumerate}

The number $2026$ is on the edge between the $45 \times 45$ square and the $47 \times 47$ square.
The region around $2026$ is:
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
N_1 & N_2 & N_3 \\
N_4 & 2026 & N_5 \\
N_6 & 2025 & N_7
\end{array}$$
where $N_7 = 2025$.

The position of $2026$ is $(22, 23)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_7 = 2025$ is at $(22, 22)$ (Below).
    \item $N_5$ is at $(23, 23)$. This is the TR corner of the $47 \times 47$ square, which is $47^2 = 2209$. (Right)
    \item $N_4$ is at $(21, 23)$. This is $2027$ (Left).
    \item $N_2$ is at $(22, 24)$. This is the next layer, "above" $2026$.
    \item $N_1$ is at $(21, 24)$.
    \item $N_3$ is at $(23, 24)$.
    \item $N_6$ is at $(21, 22)$. This is $2024$ (Diagonal Down-Left).
    \item The last neighbor is at $(23, 22)$. This is $2023$ (Diagonal Down-Right).
\end{itemize}

Let's verify the numbers around $2025 = 45^2$ at $(22, 22)$:
The numbers on the right edge leading to $2025$ are:
$(22, 21) \to 2024$
$(22, 22) \to 2025$

The numbers on the top edge of the $45 \times 45$ square end at $1981$ (TL at $(-22, 22)$).
The right edge goes from $(22, -22)$ to $(22, 22)$.
$1893$ is BR at $(22, -22)$.
$1894$ at $(21, -22)$.
...
$2024$ at $(22, 21)$.
$2025$ at $(22, 22)$.

The neighbors of $2025$ are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, 21) \to 2024$ (Below)
    \item $(22, 23) \to 2026$ (Above)
    \item $(21, 22) \to 2023$ (Left)
    \item $(23, 22) \to$ Must be $1893 + 3 \times 44 = 2025$. Wait, $1893$ is BR.
\end{itemize}
The right edge goes from $1893$ (BR) up to $2025$ (TR). The length of this side is $45-1 = 44$ steps.
$1893 + 44 = 1937$ (This is BL corner, $1893$ is BR). The side length is $2(k-1) = 44$.
The right edge is from $y=-22$ to $y=22$. $44$ steps.
$1893$ is at $(22, -22)$. $2025$ is at $(22, 22)$.
The numbers along the right edge are $1893, 1894, \dots, 2025$. There are $2025 - 1893 + 1 = 133$ numbers.
The number of steps is $22 - (-22) = 44$. There are $44+1 = 45$ grid points.
The number of steps is $44$. $1893 + 44 = 1937 \ne 2025$. The distance is $2025 - 1893 = 132$. $132/44 = 3$.
This implies that the numbers increase by 3 at each step along the edge, which is wrong for a standard Ulam spiral.

In a standard Ulam spiral, the difference between consecutive numbers along a side of the square is 1. The length of the side is $2k-2$.
For $k=23$, $2k-1 = 45$. Side length $44$.
The numbers should be $1893, 1894, \dots, 2025$. $2025 - 1893 = 132$.
The four sides have length $44$. Total new numbers: $4 \times 44 = 176$.
$1893 + 176 = 2069$. This is not $2025$. $2025 = 45^2$.

Let $m=2k-1$. The number of elements in the layer added is $m^2 - (m-2)^2 = m^2 - (m^2 - 4m + 4) = 4m - 4$.
For $m=45$: $4(45) - 4 = 180 - 4 = 176$.
The previous square ended at $43^2 = 1849$. $1849 + 176 = 2025$. Correct.

The corners of the $45 \times 45$ square: $43^2 = 1849$. Side length $44$.
TR: $2025$ at $(22, 22)$.
TL: $1981$ at $(-22, 22)$. $2025 - 44 = 1981$.
BL: $1937$ at $(-22, -22)$. $1981 - 44 = 1937$.
BR: $1893$ at $(22, -22)$. $1937 - 44 = 1893$.
The side from BR to TR: $1893, 1894, \dots, 2025$. $2025 - 1893 = 132$. The side length is $44$. $132/44 = 3$.
This spiral is NOT the standard Ulam spiral where numbers increase by 1 along the edge.

Let's use the given example:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
1 at (0,0). 2 at (1,0). 3 at (1,1). 4 at (0,1). 5 at (-1,1). 6 at (-1,0). 7 at (-1,-1). 8 at (0,-1). 9 at (1,-1).
The corners of $3 \times 3$: TR (3 at (1,1)), TL (5 at (-1,1)), BL (7 at (-1,-1)), BR (9 at (1,-1)).
$3^2=9$. $9$ is BR. $k=2$. $2k-1=3$.
TR: $(k-1, -(k-1)) = (1, -1)$ at $9$.
TL: $(-(k-1), -(k-1)) = (-1, -1)$ at $7$.
BL: $(-(k-1), k-1) = (-1, 1)$ at $5$.
BR: $(k-1, k-1) = (1, 1)$ at $3$.

The order is: Right, Up, Left, Down.
1 at (0,0).
Right 1 step to 2 at (1,0).
Up 1 step to 3 at (1,1). (TR)
Left 2 steps to 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1). (TL)
Down 2 steps to 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1). (BL)
Right 3 steps to 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1). (BR) $\leftarrow$ This is the corner $3^2=9$.

The corners of the $(2k-1) \times (2k-1)$ square:
$m=2k-1$. Max coordinate $k-1$.
BR: $(k-1, -(k-1))$ at $m^2$.
BL: $(-(k-1), -(k-1))$ at $m^2 - (m-1)$.
TL: $(-(k-1), k-1)$ at $m^2 - 2(m-1)$.
TR: $(k-1, k-1)$ at $m^2 - 3(m-1)$.

For $m=45$, $k=23$. $m-1 = 44$. $45^2 = 2025$.
BR: $(22, -22)$ at $2025$. This is the corner $N=2025$.
BL: $(-22, -22)$ at $2025 - 44 = 1981$.
TL: $(-22, 22)$ at $1981 - 44 = 1937$.
TR: $(22, 22)$ at $1937 - 44 = 1893$.

The number $2026$ is in the next layer ($47 \times 47$), which ends at $47^2 = 2209$.
The previous layer ended at $2025$ (BR corner).
The path continues from $2025$ by moving Up.
Position of $2025$: $(22, -22)$.
The next segment is along the right edge, moving up. Max coordinate $23$.
The path continues up to the next BR corner $(23, -23)$ is not possible.

The path continues from $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ by moving UP.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
The next side is the right side, going up to $23^2$ (TR of the next square).
The next square $47 \times 47$ has sides of length $46$.
The next BR corner is $47^2 = 2209$ is wrong, $47^2$ is TR.

The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square ($m=47, k=24$. $m-1=46$):
BR: $(23, -23)$ at $47^2 = 2209$. (If the pattern continues this way)
BL: $(-23, -23)$ at $2209 - 46 = 2163$.
TL: $(-23, 23)$ at $2163 - 46 = 2117$.
TR: $(23, 23)$ at $2117 - 46 = 2071$.

The layer from $45^2+1 = 2026$ to $47^2$ (should be $2071$ to $2209$).
The layer of numbers added is $4(47)-4 = 184$. $2025 + 184 = 2209$. Wait, the next square is $47 \times 47$.
The previous square was $45 \times 45$. $45^2 = 2025$.
The next layer is $47 \times 47$. The numbers are $2026$ to $2209$. The size of the layer is $2209 - 2025 = 184$. $4(47)-4 = 184$. Correct.

The path continues from $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ by moving UP.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
The right side goes from $y=-22$ to $y=23$. $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps. $46$ points. $46$ numbers.
The numbers on this side are $2026, 2027, \dots, 2026 + 45 = 2071$.
The last number $2071$ must be the BR corner of the $47 \times 47$ square. $2071$ is at $(23, 23)$? No, BR is $(23, -23)$.

Let's check the corners:
The next BR corner is $2071$. $2071$ is at $(23, -23)$.
The path is: $(22, -22) \to (22, -21), \dots, (22, 23) \to \dots \to (23, 23) \to \dots \to (23, -23)$.

The sequence of corners:
$45^2=2025$ at $(22, -22)$ (BR).
Next side length $46$.
Side 1 (Up): $2026$ to $2025+46 = 2071$. The last number $2071$ is at $(22, 23)$ (TR?). No, this is the right side.
If BR is $(22, -22)$, the right side moves UP to $(22, 23)$. $23 - (-22) = 45$ steps. $46$ numbers.
$2026$ at $(22, -21)$.
$2071$ at $(22, 23)$. This is the top-right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.

The corners of the $47 \times 47$ square (max coordinate 23):
TR: $(23, 23)$ at $2209$.
TL: $(-23, 23)$ at $2163$.
BL: $(-23, -23)$ at $2117$.
BR: $(23, -23)$ at $2071$.

The path of the new layer $2026$ to $2209$:
Starts one step "above" $2025$. $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ at $(22, -21)$.
Side 1 (Up, on $x=22$): $2026$ to $2071$. $46$ numbers. $2025+46=2071$.
The coordinates change from $y=-21$ to $y=23$. $23 - (-21) = 44$ steps. $45$ numbers.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
The path reaches the next $x$ coordinate, which is $23$. The point before the corner should be $2070$.

The side length is $2k-2 = 46$. There are 4 sides of length 46.
The previous side ended at $2025$.
The new path starts by moving up one step, then continues to the next corner.
The right edge of $45 \times 45$ ends at $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
The new layer expands to $x=23, y=23$.
The path must go: UP $\to$ LEFT $\to$ DOWN $\to$ RIGHT.

From $(22, -22)$ ($2025$):
1. UP: $(22, -21)$ is $2026$.
2. UP: $(22, 23)$ is the top edge. This is $46$ steps from the $43^2$ corner.

The path is:
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$ (BR).
Side 1 (Up): $2026$ to $2025+46 = 2071$. $2071$ is at $(22, 23)$ (TR corner of the previous square??). No.

The number $2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
Its neighbors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Below: $(22, -22) \to 2025$.
    \item Right: $(23, -21)$. This is in the next layer.
    \item Left: $(21, -21)$. This is in the previous layer.
    \item Above: $(22, -20)$. This is $2027$.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$ (Below)
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$ (Above)
    \item $(21, -21) \to N_L$ (Left)

    \item $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$ (Diagonal Up-Right)
\end{enumerate}

Numbers in the $45 \times 45$ square (ending at $2025$ at $(22, -22)$):
The right edge is from $1893$ at $(22, 22)$ to $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
$1893$ at $(22, 22)$ (TR).
$1937$ at $(-22, 22)$ (TL).
$1981$ at $(-22, -22)$ (BL).
$2025$ at $(22, -22)$ (BR).

The path for the $45 \times 45$ square: TR $\to$ TL $\to$ BL $\to$ BR.
TR: $(22, 22)$ at $1893$.
TL: $(-22, 22)$ at $1937$. $1937 - 1893 = 44$.
BL: $(-22, -22)$ at $1981$. $1981 - 1937 = 44$.
BR: $(22, -22)$ at $2025$. $2025 - 1981 = 44$.

$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ (BR).
The previous number $2024$ is at $(21, -22)$ (one step left).
The number before $2024$ is $2023$ at $(20, -22)$.

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
1. $(22, -22) \to 2025$ (Below, inside $45 \times 45$).
2. $(22, -20) \to 2027$ (Above, next in sequence).
3. $(21, -21) \to N_L$. This is a diagonal neighbor.

8. $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$.

We need the values of the numbers in the $45 \times 45$ square around $2025$.
$2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
The side leading to $2025$ is the bottom side, from $1981$ (BL at $(-22, -22)$) to $2025$ (BR at $(22, -22)$). This side is along $y=-22$.
$1981, 1982, \dots, 2025$.
$2025 - 1981 = 44$. There are $44$ steps, so $45$ points.
$2024$ is at $(21, -22)$.
$2023$ is at $(20, -22)$.
...
$1981$ is at $(-22, -22)$.

Neighbors inside $45 \times 45$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$ (Below)
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$ (Diagonal Down-Left)
    \item $(23, -22) \to N_{DR}$. This is outside the $45 \times 45$ boundary $x \le 22$. This neighbor is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
1. $(22, -22) \to 2025$ (Below, inside $45 \times 45$).
2. $(22, -20) \to 2027$ (Above, next in sequence).
3. $(21, -21) \to N_L$. This is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
4. $(23, -21) \to N_R$. This is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
5. $(21, -22) \to 2024$ (Diagonal Down-Left, inside $45 \times 45$).
6. $(23, -22) \to N_{DR}$. This is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
7. $(21, -20) \to N_{UL}$. This is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
8. $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$. This is in the $47 \times 47$ layer.

We need the numbers in the $47 \times 47$ square, $2026$ to $2209$.
The path starts from $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ by moving up one step.
$2026$ at $(22, -21)$.
The path continues up along $x=22$ until $y=23$. $23 - (-21) = 44$ steps. $45$ numbers.
$2026, \dots, 2026+44 = 2070$.
$2070$ is at $(22, 23)$.

The next corner, $2071$, is the BR corner at $(23, -23)$.
The path from $(22, 23)$ must move left to $(-23, 23)$ (TL).
This is inconsistent with the standard spiral. Let's assume the neighbors are within the current layer or the previous one.

The number $2026$ is on the first segment of the new layer.
The neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2025 (Below)
    \item 2027 (Above)
    \item 2024 (Diag DL)
\end{itemize}
The other 5 neighbors are in the new layer or the next one.

Since $2026$ is an interior point of the first segment of the new layer, its neighbors should be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Below: $2025$ (Previous layer)
    \item Above: $2027$ (Next number)
    \item Diag DL: $2024$ (Previous layer)
\end{itemize}
The coordinates of $2026$ are $(22, -21)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$
\end{enumerate}
The other 5 neighbors must be on the boundary of the next layer.
The next layer goes from $x=23$ to $x=-23$.

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(23, -21) \to N_R$ (Right)
    \item $(21, -21) \to N_L$ (Left)
    \item $(23, -22) \to N_{DR}$ (Diag Down-Right)
    \item $(21, -20) \to N_{UL}$ (Diag Up-Left)
    \item $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$ (Diag Up-Right)
\end{itemize}

The right boundary of the $45 \times 45$ square is $x=22$. The next layer starts at $x=23$.
The numbers in the $47 \times 47$ layer start at $x=23$ or $x=22$ depending on the path.

The path is $2025(22,-22) \xrightarrow{+1} 2026(22,-21) \xrightarrow{+1} \dots \xrightarrow{+44} 2070(22, 23)$.
The neighbor $(23, -21)$ is at $x=23$. This point is the right boundary of the $47 \times 47$ layer.
The numbers on the first side (Up) are at $x=22$. The next side (Left) starts at $y=23$.

Since $2026$ is on the first segment going UP along $x=22$, the neighbors $(23, -21), (23, -22), (23, -20)$ are outside the current segment $x=22$. They are on the boundary $x=23$.
These points must belong to the previous or next segment of the spiral.

The neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$
    \item $(21, -21)$: Must be in the $47 \times 47$ layer, at $x=21$. This means the $47 \times 47$ layer has points at $x=21$ already.
\end{itemize}

The layer $47 \times 47$ extends from $x=-23$ to $x=23$ and $y=-23$ to $y=23$.
The first segment is $x=22$, $y$ from $-21$ to $23$.
The point $(21, -21)$ is inside the $47 \times 47$ layer.

If $2026$ is the $i$-th number in the layer $L$, its neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2026 - 1$
    \item $2026 + 1$
    \item Neighbors in the previous layer $L-1$.
    \item Neighbors in the next layer $L+1$.
\end{itemize}

The neighbors of $2026$ are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2025$ (Below, $L-1$)
    \item $2027$ (Above, $L$)
    \item $2024$ (Diag DL, $L-1$)
\end{itemize}
The other 5 neighbors must be in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
The path of the $47 \times 47$ layer is:
$2026(22, -21), 2027(22, -20), \dots, 2070(22, 23)$.
The next number $2071$ is at $(23, 23)$ (TR corner). No, $2071$ is BR corner $(23, -23)$.

Let's assume the standard Ulam spiral where the segments are of length $2k-2$.
$m=45$: side length $44$. $2025$ is at BR $(22, -22)$.
$m=47$: side length $46$.
The new layer starts at $(22, -21)$ with $2026$.
The path goes UP along $x=22$ for $46$ steps to $2026+45 = 2071$. $2071$ is at $(22, 23)$.
The number $2071$ is the end of the first side. $2071$ should be a corner.
The corners of $47 \times 47$: BR $2071$, BL $2117$, TL $2163$, TR $2209$.

$2071$ at $(22, 23)$. This point is not a corner, as corners are at $x, y = \pm 23$.
The boundary of the $47 \times 47$ layer is $x, y \in \{-23, 23\}$.
The path should be: $2025(22,-22) \to 2026(22,-21) \to \dots \to 2070(22, 23)$. This is 45 steps. $2026+44 = 2070$. $2070$ at $(22, 23)$.

The path continues Left: $2071$ at $(21, 23)$. $\dots$ to $(-23, 23)$ at $2070 + 45 = 2115$. $2117$ is TL.

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2025$ (Below)
    \item $2027$ (Above, $22, -20$)
    \item $2024$ (Diag DL, $21, -22$)
\end{itemize}
The remaining 5 neighbors are in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(23, -21) \to N_R$. This is the right edge, $x=23$. This is the next side.
    \item $(21, -21) \to N_L$. This is inside the current side $x=22$. Wrong.
\end{itemize}
Since the path is $x=22$, the neighbors with $x=22$ are $2025, 2027$.
The neighbors with $x=21$ are in the previous layer or the next layer.

The 8 neighbors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$
    \item $(23, -22) \to N_{DR}$. This is outside $x=22$.
    \item $(21, -21) \to N_L$. This is on the $x=21$ line.
    \item $(23, -21) \to N_R$.
    \item $(21, -20) \to N_{UL}$.
    \item $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$.
\end{itemize}

The number $2026$ is on the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square. The points $(23, y)$ are not part of the current path segment.
The $47 \times 47$ layer covers $x, y \in \{-23, \dots, 23\}$.
The number $2026$ at $(22, -21)$ is connected to the previous layer $45 \times 45$ (where $x \le 22$).

The neighbors of $2026$ that are in the $45 \times 45$ square are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$
\end{itemize}
The neighbors that are in the $47 \times 47$ layer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$
    \item $(21, -21) \to N_L$
    \item $(21, -20) \to N_{UL}$
    \item $(23, -21) \to N_R$
    \item $(23, -22) \to N_{DR}$
    \item $(23, -20) \to N_{UR}$
\end{itemize}

The neighbors in the same segment ($x=22$): $(22, -20) \to 2027$.
The neighbors on the edge of the previous layer: $(22, -22) \to 2025$, $(21, -22) \to 2024$.

The points $(21, -21), (21, -20)$ are in the $47 \times 47$ layer.
The points $(23, -21), (23, -22), (23, -20)$ are in the $47 \times 47$ layer.

The sum of neighbors for any number $N$ that is not a corner is $8N$ or $8N \pm \text{const}$.
For an interior point in an infinite grid, the sum is $8N$.
For a point on the $k$-th layer, the sum is $8N + \text{boundary terms}$.

The sum of the 8 neighbors of $N$ is $8N + \sum_{j=1}^8 (\text{pos}_j - \text{pos}_N)$.
If the neighbors are $N \pm \delta_i$, the sum is $8N + \sum \delta_i$.

If $2026$ was in the interior of the $47 \times 47$ layer, the sum would be $8 \times 2026$.
Since it's on the boundary, some neighbors belong to $45 \times 45$ or are not yet filled.
The spiral is dense. All 8 neighbors should be filled.

The 8 neighbors are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $2025$ (Below)
    \item $2027$ (Above, next in sequence)
    \item $2024$ (Diag DL)
    \item $2028$ (Diag UL) $\rightarrow (21, -20)$
    \item $2023$ (Diag DR) $\rightarrow (23, -22)$
    \item $N_L \rightarrow (21, -21)$
    \item $N_R \rightarrow (23, -21)$
    \item $N_{UR} \rightarrow (23, -20)$
\end{enumerate}

The numbers are filled sequentially. $2026$ is the current number being filled. Its neighbors are already filled.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -22) \to 2025$
    \item $(22, -20) \to 2027$
    \item $(21, -22) \to 2024$
\end{enumerate}
The remaining 5 neighbors must be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(21, -21)$ must be $2028$ or less.
    \item $(23, -21)$ must be $2028$ or less.
\end{itemize}
The neighbors that are NOT $2025, 2027, 2024$ must be smaller than $2026$.

The point $(21, -21)$ is $1$ step left and $1$ step up from $2025$.
The spiral path means that the number at $(x, y)$ is generally close to the number at a neighbor's position.

The sum of the 8 neighbors of $N$ is $8N + \text{correction}$.
The correction for any number not on the outer boundary of the grid is 0.
The outer boundary is the edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$, which is not on the outer boundary $x, y = \pm 23$.
Therefore, all 8 neighbors are within the $47 \times 47$ region.

The path segment of $2026$ is along $x=22$. The $x=23$ points are not yet filled.
This implies that some neighbors are not filled yet.
This is impossible for the question to make sense. The question implies all 8 neighbors exist.

The only way for all 8 neighbors to exist is if $2026$ is in the interior of the $47 \times 47$ square.
If $2026$ is in the interior, the sum is $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

The center of the $47 \times 47$ square is $(0, 0)$.
$2026$ is very close to the edge, $x=22$.

If we assume the spiral is in a very large grid, the sum is $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.
