Solution:
The numbers are written on a square grid spiral. Let's analyze the structure of the spiral to determine the position of the number 2026.

The numbers along the edges of the square layers follow a pattern related to perfect squares. The largest number in the $k$-th square layer (side length $2k-1$) is $(2k-1)^2$. The side length of the square containing the number $n$ is determined by the smallest odd integer $2k-1$ such that $n \le (2k-1)^2$.

We need to find $k$ such that $(2k-3)^2 < 2026 \le (2k-1)^2$.
Calculate the squares of odd numbers:
$41^2 = 1681$
$43^2 = 1849$
$45^2 = 2025$
$47^2 = 2209$

Since $45^2 = 2025$ and $47^2 = 2209$, the number 2026 is in the layer corresponding to $2k-1 = 47$, so $2k = 48$, $k=24$.
The $24$-th layer is the square with side length $47$. The largest number in the $(k-1)$-th layer ($k=23$) is $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.

The number $2025 = 45^2$ is located at the bottom right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square. The $47 \times 47$ square starts from $2025+1 = 2026$.

Let the center of the spiral be $(0, 0)$. The coordinates of the corners of the $m \times m$ square are related to $m^2$.
For the $45 \times 45$ square, $45^2 = 2025$. The side length is $2(23)-1 = 45$. The maximum extent is $22$ units from the center. The coordinates range from $-22$ to $22$.
The number $45^2 = 2025$ is at the bottom right corner, $(22, -22)$.

The next layer is the $47 \times 47$ square, with side length $2(24)-1 = 47$. The coordinates range from $-23$ to $23$.
The numbers in this layer start from $2026$. The path of the spiral follows the pattern: right, up, left, down, right, ...

The number $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ (bottom right).
The spiral moves:
1. Right: Increases $x$ from $22$ to $23$. The next position is $(23, -22)$. The number is $2026$.
2. Up: Increases $y$ from $-22$ to $23$. The numbers are $2027, 2028, \dots$
3. Left: Decreases $x$ from $23$ to $-23$.
4. Down: Decreases $y$ from $23$ to $-23$.
5. Right: Increases $x$ from $-23$ to $23$.

The number $2026$ is the first number on the $47 \times 47$ layer.
It is immediately to the right of $2025$.

Coordinates:
Let the position of $1$ be $(0, 0)$.
The position of $n^2$ is $( (n-1)/2, -(n-1)/2 )$.
For $45^2 = 2025$, $n=45$. Position is $( (45-1)/2, -(45-1)/2 ) = (22, -22)$.

The number $2026$ is next to $2025$ in the spiral direction. The spiral moves right from the bottom right corner of the previous square.
Position of $2025$: $(22, -22)$.
Position of $2026$: $(22+1, -22) = (23, -22)$.

The 8 neighbors of a number at $(x, y)$ are the numbers at coordinates:
$(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1)$
$(x-1, y), \quad \quad \quad (x+1, y)$
$(x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)$

For $2026$ at $(23, -22)$, the neighbors' coordinates are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(22, -23)$: Bottom left of $2025$'s layer, i.e., $43^2$ is at $(21, -21)$. $45^2$ is at $(22, -22)$. The bottom edge of $47 \times 47$ square goes from $(23, -23)$ to $(-23, -23)$. The number at $(22, -23)$ is on the bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square, two steps before the bottom left corner.
    \item $(23, -23)$: Bottom edge.
    \item $(24, -23)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ square boundary (which is up to $23$). This neighbor lies on the $49 \times 49$ square.
    \item $(22, -22)$: This is the position of $2025$.
    \item $(24, -22)$: On the right edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.
    \item $(22, -21)$: This number is $2026-2 = 2024$ if $2025$ was at the corner, but $2026$ is not at a corner. Let's re-examine the spiral path near $2025$.
\end{itemize}

The $45 \times 45$ square ends at $2025 = 45^2$ at position $(22, -22)$.
The $47 \times 47$ square follows:
1. Right (1 step): $2026$ at $(23, -22)$. (This is the position of $2026$).
2. Up (46 steps): $2027$ to $2026+46 = 2072$. The path is $(23, -21), \dots, (23, 23)$. The corner is $2072$ at $(23, 23)$ (Top right).
3. Left (46 steps): $2073$ to $2072+46 = 2118$. The path is $(22, 23), \dots, (-23, 23)$. The corner is $2118$ at $(-23, 23)$ (Top left).
4. Down (46 steps): $2119$ to $2118+46 = 2164$. The path is $(-23, 22), \dots, (-23, -23)$. The corner is $2164$ at $(-23, -23)$ (Bottom left).
5. Right (46 steps): $2165$ to $2164+46 = 2210$. The path is $(-22, -23), \dots, (23, -23)$. The corner $2209=47^2$ is at $(22, -23)$. The last position is $(23, -23)$.

The neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$ are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(22, -23)$: On the bottom edge, next to the bottom-right corner $(22, -22)$ of $45^2$. This number is $2210 - (23-22) = 2209$, wait, $2209=47^2$ is at $(22, -23)$.
    Let's retrace the end of the spiral for $47^2=2209$.
    The bottom left corner is at $(-23, -23)$, number $2164$.
    The path goes right along $y=-23$: $(-22, -23), \dots, (22, -23), (23, -23)$.
    The numbers are $2165, \dots, 2209, 2210$. Wait, $47^2=2209$.
    The number of steps to reach $2209$ from $2164$ is $2209 - 2164 = 45$. The path has $46$ steps (from $x=-23$ to $x=23$ inclusive is $47$ positions, $46$ steps).
    The positions are $x=-23$ (start, $2164+1=2165$), $\dots$, $x=23$.
    The number $47^2=2209$ is at the top right corner of the $47 \times 47$ square if it followed the pattern of $n^2$ being at the bottom right. Let's check the parity of the square side.
    $45^2=2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
    $47^2=2209$ must be at $(23, -23)$.

    If $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$:
    The path before $2209$ is: $2164$ at $(-23, -23)$ (Bottom left).
    The path goes right from $x=-23$ to $x=23$ along $y=-23$.
    $2165$ at $(-22, -23)$, $\dots$, $2209$ at $(22, -23)$. This is $22 - (-22) = 44$ steps, so $45$ numbers. $2164+45 = 2209$.
    So, $2209$ is at $(22, -23)$.

    The path continues: $2210$ at $(23, -23)$ (Bottom right). This is the last position of the $47 \times 47$ layer if it continued. The $47 \times 47$ square ends at $2209$ at $(22, -23)$. The next layer starts at $2210$.

    Let's go back to $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
    Its neighbors are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(22, -23)$: This is $2209 - 1 = 2208$ if the path was counter-clockwise.
        The number to the left of $2209$ on the bottom edge $y=-23$ is $2208$ at $(21, -23)$.
        The number $2209$ is at $(22, -23)$. The number to its left is at $(21, -23)$, which is $2208$.
        The number $2209$ is the corner. The path before it: $2164$ at $(-23, -23)$ (BL), $2165$ at $(-22, -23)$, $\dots$, $2209$ at $(22, -23)$.
        The neighbor $(22, -23)$ is $2209$.
        \item $(23, -23)$: This is the next position on the bottom edge. This should be $2210$.
        \item $(24, -23)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary. This number is in the next layer.
        \item $(22, -22)$: This is $2025$.
        \item $(24, -22)$: Outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary.
        \item $(22, -21)$: This number is on the upward path of $2026$. $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. The upward path starts at $(23, -22)$ and goes to $(23, 23)$.
        The number immediately below $2026$ is $2025$ at $(22, -22)$. (This is a common error in assigning coordinates. Let's use the standard indexing where $y$ increases upwards).
    \end{itemize}

    The number $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
    The neighbors are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(22, -23)$: This number is the one to the left of $2209$ on the bottom edge if $2209$ is at $(22, -23)$. $2208$.
        \item $(23, -23)$: This number is the next one to the right of $2209$ on the bottom edge. $2210$.
        \item $(24, -23)$: Neighbor outside the $47 \times 47$ square.
        \item $(22, -22)$: This is $2025$.
        \item $(24, -22)$: Neighbor outside the $47 \times 47$ square.
        \item $(22, -21)$: This is $2026 - 2 = 2024$ if $2025$ was the corner.
        \item $(23, -21)$: This is $2027$ (the next number in the spiral).
        \item $(24, -21)$: Neighbor outside the $47 \times 47$ square.
    \end{enumerate}

    The neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$ are the values at:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(22, -23)$: $2208$ (from previous calculations based on $47^2=2209$ at $(22, -23)$).
        \item $(23, -23)$: $2210$.
        \item $(24, -23)$: Let $N_{out}$ be the value outside the $47 \times 47$ square. This will be on the $49 \times 49$ layer.
        \item $(22, -22)$: $2025$.
        \item $(24, -22)$: $N_{out}$.
        \item $(22, -21)$: $2024$. (The number preceding $2025$ is $2024$ at $(21, -22)$ if $2025$ at $(22, -22)$).
        The spiral path just before $2025$: $2024$ is at $(21, -22)$. $2023$ is at $(21, -21)$. $2022$ is at $(22, -21)$. $2021$ is at $(23, -21)$. $2020$ is at $(23, -20)$.

        Let's determine the numbers around $2025$:
        $45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
        The segment before is from the left edge: $2025$ is reached by moving right from $(21, -22)$.
        The number before $2025$ is $2024$ at $(21, -22)$.
        The number before $2024$ is $2023$ at $(21, -21)$.
        The number before $2023$ is $2022$ at $(22, -21)$.

        The number before $2021$ is $2020$ at $(23, -20)$.
        The number before $2020$ is $2019$ at $(23, -19)$.
