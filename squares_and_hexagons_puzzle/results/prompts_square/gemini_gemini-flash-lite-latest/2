Solution:
The problem describes a square spiral arrangement of natural numbers. The center is 1, and the numbers spiral outwards in a counterclockwise direction.

Let's examine the structure of the spiral by looking at the layers, where the $k$-th layer (for $k \ge 1$) forms a square ring around the center. The side length of the square formed by the numbers up to the $k$-th layer is $2k + 1$. The largest number in the $k$-th layer is $(2k+1)^2$.

Layer 1 (side $3 \times 3$): Largest number is $3^2 = 9$. The corners are $3, 5, 7, 9$.
Layer 2 (side $5 \times 5$): Largest number is $5^2 = 25$. The corners are $13, 17, 21, 25$.
Layer $k$: Largest number is $N_k = (2k+1)^2$.

We need to find which layer the number $2026$ belongs to. We look for $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2$.

First, find the square root of 2026: $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011$.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, we have:
$45^2 = 2025 < 2026$.
$47^2 = (45+2)^2 = 2025 + 180 + 4 = 2209$.

Since $45^2 = 2025$ and $47^2 = 2209$, the number 2026 is in the layer where the largest number is $47^2 = 2209$.
This corresponds to $2k+1 = 47$, so $2k = 46$, and $k = 23$.
The number 2026 is in the 23rd layer.

The largest number in the 23rd layer is $N_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$. This number is at the bottom-right corner of the $47 \times 47$ square.

The side length of the square containing the 23rd layer is $S = 47$. The previous layer's largest number is $N_{22} = (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. This number is at the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.

The spiral moves counterclockwise:
1. From $45^2 = 2025$ (bottom right of $45 \times 45$), the next number is $2026$.
2. The path of the 23rd layer starts from $2025 + 1 = 2026$.

The path of the $k$-th layer starts from $(2k-1)^2 + 1$ and ends at $(2k+1)^2$. The side length of the outer ring is $2k$.
For $k=23$, $2k = 46$. The side length of the square is 47.

The largest number of the previous layer is $45^2 = 2025$. This is the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
The numbers in the 23rd layer follow this path:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Move up (left column, decreasing row index): $2025+1, 2025+2, \ldots$
    \item Move left (top row, decreasing column index): $\ldots$
    \item Move down (right column, increasing row index): $\ldots$
    \item Move right (bottom row, increasing column index): $\ldots, 47^2 = 2209$.
\end{enumerate}
The path is: bottom-right $\to$ up $\to$ left $\to$ down $\to$ right.

The sequence of numbers starting from $2025$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Up segment (left edge of the $47 \times 47$ square, excluding the bottom-right corner):
    The side length is 47. The number of steps upwards is $47 - 1 = 46$.
    The numbers are $2025+1, 2025+2, \ldots, 2025+46$.
    $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2071$.
    The number $2071$ is at the top-left corner ($47 \times 47$ square).
    The coordinates relative to the center (1 at $(0,0)$) for $2025$ (bottom-right of $45 \times 45$) are $(22, -22)$.
    The move is UP (increasing $y$ coordinate).
    $2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.
    $2071$ is at $(22, 22)$. (The coordinate system is $(x, y)$ where $x$ is horizontal, $y$ is vertical, increasing to the right and up).
    The square corners for $2k+1$ are at $(\pm k, \pm k)$. For $k=23$, the corners are $(\pm 23, \pm 23)$.
    $45^2 = 2025$ is at $(22, -22)$ if we consider the "inner" square.
    The numbers in the $k$-th layer form a square of side $2k$. The corners of this square are at coordinates $(\pm k, \pm k)$.
    The largest number $(2k+1)^2$ is at $(k, -k)$ if the spiral is: right $\to$ up $\to$ left $\to$ down.
    The spiral in the problem is: right $\to$ up $\to$ left $\to$ down, if we trace from 1 outwards.
    Let's confirm the layout from the example:
    1 at $(0,0)$.
    2 at $(1, 0)$ (Right).
    3 at $(1, 1)$ (Up).
    4 at $(0, 1)$ (Left).
    5 at $(-1, 1)$ (Left).
    6 at $(-1, 0)$ (Down).
    7 at $(-1, -1)$ (Down).
    8 at $(0, -1)$ (Right).
    9 at $(1, -1)$ (Right). (Bottom-Right corner of $3 \times 3$)

    The sequence of moves for the $k$-th layer ($2k+1$ side) starting from $(2k-1)^2$:
    $N_{k-1} = (2k-1)^2$ is at $(k-1, -(k-1))$.
    Move Right (1 step): $N_{k-1}+1$ at $(k, -(k-1))$.
    Move Up ($2k-1$ steps): $\ldots$ to $(k, k)$. (Top-Right corner)
    Move Left ($2k$ steps): $\ldots$ to $(-k, k)$. (Top-Left corner)
    Move Down ($2k$ steps): $\ldots$ to $(-k, -k)$. (Bottom-Left corner)
    Move Right ($2k$ steps): $\ldots$ to $(k, -k)$. (Bottom-Right corner) $\to (2k+1)^2$.

    Let $k=23$. $2k-1 = 45$. $N_{22} = 45^2 = 2025$.
    Position of $2025$: $(22, -22)$.

    The path for the 23rd layer starts at $2026$.
    1. Right (1 step): $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This is the location of $2026$.
    2. Up ($2k-1 = 45$ steps): $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2026+45-1 = 2070$.
       The final number $2070$ is at $(23, 22)$. (Top-Right corner)
    3. Left ($2k = 46$ steps): $2071, \ldots, 2070+46 = 2116$.
       The final number $2116$ is at $(-23, 22)$. (Top-Left corner)
    4. Down ($2k = 46$ steps): $2117, \ldots, 2116+46 = 2162$.
       The final number $2162$ is at $(-23, -22)$. (Bottom-Left corner)
    5. Right ($2k = 46$ steps): $2163, \ldots, 2162+46 = 2208$.
       The final number $2208$ is at $(22, -22)$.
       Wait, $(2k+1)^2 = 2209$. The last number in the layer should be $2209$.
       The side length of the square is $2k+1=47$. The distance between corners is $2k=46$.
       The total number of steps in the layer is $1 + 45 + 46 + 46 + 46 = 184$.
       The number of elements in the layer is $(2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = (4k^2+4k+1) - (4k^2-4k+1) = 8k = 8 \times 23 = 184$. This matches.

    The end of the right segment should be $2209$ at $(23, -23)$. Let's re-examine the spiral direction for the last number.
    The last number is $47^2 = 2209$. The position of $(2k+1)^2$ is $(k, -k)$. For $k=23$, $(23, -23)$.

    Let's adjust the steps to match the corner positions $(\pm 23, \pm 23)$.
    $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$.
    1. Right (1 step): $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
    2. Up ($46$ steps): $2026, \ldots, 2026+46-1 = 2071$. $2071$ is at $(23, 23)$. (Top-Right corner)
    3. Left ($46$ steps): $2072, \ldots, 2071+46 = 2117$. $2117$ is at $(-23, 23)$. (Top-Left corner)
    4. Down ($46$ steps): $2118, \ldots, 2117+46 = 2163$. $2163$ is at $(-23, -23)$. (Bottom-Left corner)
    5. Right ($46$ steps): $2164, \ldots, 2163+46 = 2209$. $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$. (Bottom-Right corner, which is $(k, -k)$).

    The number $2026$ is located at position $(x, y) = (23, -22)$. This is on the right edge, one step above the bottom-right corner of the outer square.

    The neighbors of $(x, y)$ are $(x\pm 1, y), (x, y\pm 1), (x\pm 1, y\pm 1)$. There are 8 neighbors, provided they are within the grid boundaries. Since $2026$ is not near the edge of the grid (the grid size is $47 \times 47$), all 8 neighbors exist.

    The neighbors of $(23, -22)$ are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Directly above: $(23, -21)$
        \item Directly below: $(23, -23)$
        \item Directly left: $(22, -22)$
        \item Directly right: $(24, -22)$ (Outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary, but this is not relevant for the neighbors' values, only their existence in the sequence)
        \item Diagonals: $(22, -21), (22, -23), (24, -21), (24, -23)$
    \end{itemize}

    We need to determine which numbers correspond to these positions.
    The number $N$ at $(x, y)$ is determined by the layer $k=23$. The coordinates are in $[-23, 23]$.

    1. **Position $(23, -22)$ is $2026$.**
    2. **Neighbor above: $(23, -21)$**. This is the next number in the UP sequence (Step 2):
       $2026 \to 2027$ at $(23, -21)$.

    3. **Neighbor below: $(23, -23)$**. This is the final position of the RIGHT segment (Step 5), which is $2209$.
       However, the numbering stops at $2209$. The number immediately *before* $2209$ is $2208$ at $(22, -23)$.
       The position $(23, -23)$ is the bottom-right corner, $2209$.
       The position $(22, -23)$ is the number $2208$.
       The position $(23, -22)$ is $2026$.

       Let's check the neighbors of the corner $2209$ at $(23, -23)$:
       Its neighbors are $2208$ (left, $(22, -23)$) and $2163$ (up, $(-23, -23)$ is Bottom-Left, this is wrong).

       The number immediately *below* $2026$ at $(23, -22)$ is the number reached by moving one step in the direction opposite to the segment 2026 belongs to.
       Segment 1: Right (from $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ to $2026$ at $(23, -22)$).
       Segment 2: Up (from $2026$ at $(23, -22)$ to $2071$ at $(23, 23)$).
       Segment 5: Right (from $2163$ at $(-23, -23)$ to $2209$ at $(23, -23)$).

       The number $2026$ is on the right edge, one position away from the bottom-right corner $2209$ (moving counterclockwise).
       The segment $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2071$ is on the line $x=23$.

       Neighbor below $(23, -23)$ is the final number of the layer, $2209$.

    4. **Neighbor left: $(22, -22)$**. This is the last number of the previous layer, $2025$.

    5. **Neighbor right: $(24, -22)$**. This position is outside the $47 \times 47$ boundary defined by the layer $k=23$. The next layer ($k=24$) starts at $2210$. This neighbor must belong to the next layer, as it's outside the current ring's coordinates.

    6. **Diagonals**:
       * $(22, -21)$: Inside the $45 \times 45$ square (previous layer), or on the boundary between layers.
       * $(22, -23)$: Left neighbor of $2209$. This is $2208$.
       * $(24, -21), (24, -23)$: These are in the next layer ($k=24$).

    We need the coordinates of all neighbors of a number $N$ in the spiral. A neighbor $M$ can be in the same layer as $N$, the previous layer, or the next layer.

    $N = 2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.

    Neighbors in the same layer (Ring $k=23$):
    * Up $(23, -21)$: $2027$ (Since $2026$ is moving up)
    * Down $(23, -23)$: $2209$ (Corner, the end of the layer)
    * Left $(22, -22)$: $2025$ (Previous layer boundary)
    * Diagonals within the path segments:
        * $(22, -21)$: This position is on the line $y=-22$ (same row as $2026$). Since $2026$ is on the right edge ($x=23$), $x=22$ is the interior. This point is in the *previous* layer's structure or the beginning of the spiral expansion.
        * $(22, -23)$: This is the left neighbor of $2209$, which is $2208$.

    Let's list the neighbors of $N=2026$ at $(23, -22)$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(23, -21) \implies 2027$ (Same layer, next step in UP sequence)
        \item $(23, -23) \implies 2209$ (Same layer, end of layer)
        \item $(22, -22) \implies 2025$ (Previous layer, $45^2$)
        \item $(24, -22) \implies$ Next layer (Layer 24)
        \item $(22, -21) \implies$ ?
        \item $(22, -23) \implies 2208$ (Same layer, left neighbor of $2209$)
        \item $(24, -21) \implies$ Next layer
        \item $(24, -23) \implies$ Next layer
    \end{itemize}

    We need the structure of the immediate neighbors of $2025$ and $2026$.
    $2025$ is at $(22, -22)$. Neighbors of $2025$:
    * Right: $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
    * Up: $2025 - 45 = 1980$ (if the move was down). It's on the corner of $45 \times 45$.
    $45^2$ is the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square.
    Its neighbors in the $45 \times 45$ square are:
    * Left: $2024$ (Previous segment end).
    * Up: $2025 - 45 = 1980$ (If the spiral was down).
    The layer $k=22$ ($45 \times 45$) ends with $2025$. Its structure:
    $44^2 = 1936$ at $(21, -21)$.
    1. Right: $1937$ at $(22, -21)$.
    2. Up (44 steps): $1937, \ldots, 1980$ at $(22, 22)$.
    3. Left (44 steps): $1981, \ldots, 2024$ at $(-22, 22)$.
    4. Down (44 steps): $2025$ at $(-22, -22)$. Wait, $2025$ must be at $(22, -22)$.

    Re-checking $45^2$ position: $(k-1, -(k-1)) = (22, -22)$ for $k=23$. This is consistent with the right segment ending at $(k, -k)$.

    The neighbor to the left of $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ should be $2024$. $2024$ is the end of the Down segment of layer 22.
    The Down segment of layer 22 ($45 \times 45$) goes from $(-22, 22)$ to $(22, -22)$.
    The number before $2025$ is $2024$. $2024$ is at $(21, -22)$ if the move is right.
    Let's assume the neighbors of $N$ are determined by the grid coordinates in the plane.

    $N=2026$ at $P = (23, -22)$.
    The set of neighbors $S$ of $P$:
    $S = \{(22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23), (22, -22), (24, -22), (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)\}$.

    1. **$P_1 = (22, -22)$**: $2025$ (End of layer 22).

    2. **$P_2 = (23, -21)$**: Next in UP sequence: $2027$.

    3. **$P_3 = (22, -21)$**: This is in the region of $x < 23$ and $y > -22$.
       $2026$ is on the segment that goes $R(1), U(46), L(46), D(46), R(46)$.
       $P_3$ is just "inside" the boundary $x=23$. Since $2026$ is on the boundary $x=23$, $P_3$ is within the structure of the previous layer's expansion region.
       The $45 \times 45$ square has corners at $(\pm 22, \pm 22)$.
       The number $2025$ at $(22, -22)$ is the bottom-right corner. Its path was $D(44)$ from $(-22, 22)$ to $(22, -22)$.
       The number before $2025$ is $2024$ at $(21, -22)$.

       Let's check $2026$'s immediate neighbors in the spiral path: $2025$ (behind) and $2027$ (ahead).

       The number $2026$ is a "rightward" number in its local structure (part of the first step out).
       $2025$ is below-right of $2026$. $2026$ is above-left of $2025$ in the structure if we reverse the path.
       In the plane: $2025$ is West of $2026$. $2027$ is North of $2026$.

       The sum of the neighbors of any number $N$ in the $k$-th layer, not on the corners or edges defined by the sequence direction, is $8N \pm (\text{some constant})$.
       For a number $N$ in the interior of a layer, the sum of its 8 neighbors is $8N$.

       $N=2026$ is on the edge of the spiral expansion (the first step out).
       $N$ is on the line $x=23$, $y=-22$.

       Neighbors in the same layer ($k=23$):
       * $N_{North} = 2027$ at $(23, -21)$.
       * $N_{South} = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. (End of the layer)
       * $N_{West} = 2025$ at $(22, -22)$. (Previous layer end)

       The neighbors $N_{NE}, N_{SE}, N_{SW}, N_{NW}$ depend on the exact coordinate system and where the numbers of the previous layer fall.

       Since $2026$ is on the path segment $R(1)$, its neighbors are:
       - To its North: $2027$.
       - To its South: $2209$ (if $2209$ is indeed immediately south).
       - To its West: $2025$.

       Consider the center $C$ of the $3 \times 3$ square containing $N$.
       If $N$ is not a corner of the $3 \times 3$ square formed by its neighbors, the sum is $8N$.
       The $3 \times 3$ square centered at $N=2026$:
       \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       $X$ & $2027$ & $X$ \\
       \hline
       $2025$ & $2026$ & $Y$ \\
       \hline
       $2208$ & $2209$ & $Z$ \\
       \hline
       \end{tabular}
       (This layout assumes $2025$ is West, $2027$ is North, $2209$ is South).

       Let's verify the position of $2209$ at $(23, -23)$ relative to $2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
       $2209$ is directly South of $2026$.

       Let's verify $2208$ at $(22, -23)$. This is South-West of $2026$.

       The neighbors of $2026$ at $(23, -22)$ are:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item North: $2027$ at $(23, -21)$.
           \item South: $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
           \item West: $2025$ at $(22, -22)$.
           \item East: $X$ (Next layer) at $(24, -22)$.
           \item NW: $W$ at $(22, -21)$.
           \item NE: $X'$ at $(24, -21)$.
           \item SW: $2208$ at $(22, -23)$.
           \item SE: $Z$ at $(24, -23)$.
       \end{itemize}

       If $N$ is not a corner, the sum of its neighbors is $8N$.
       This property holds if the $3 \times 3$ square centered at $N$ is entirely within a region where the values are related linearly or if $N$ is an "interior" point of the layer.

       $2026$ is an edge point of the spiral, so the sum is not exactly $8N$.

       The sum of the neighbors of $N$ is: $S = \sum_{i=1}^8 N_i$.
       $S = (2027 + 2209 + 2025) + X + W + X' + 2208 + Z$.
       $2027 + 2209 + 2025 + 2208 = 8469$.

       We need $X, W, X', Z$.
       $X$ is at $(24, -22)$. It belongs to layer 24. Layer 24 starts at $2210$.
       $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$. $2210$ is the first number of the next layer.
       $2209 \to 2210$ at $(22, -23)$ (if we reverse the path).
       The coordinates of layer 24 start from $k=24$. $N_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
       The next step is to move from $(23, -23)$ towards the outside.
       The first step of layer 24 is Right: $2210$ at $(24, -23)$.
       The path of layer 24 starts at $2210$ at $(24, -23)$ by moving Right.
       $2209$ is at $(23, -23)$.
       $2210$ is at $(24, -23)$. This is $Z$. So $Z = 2210$.

       $X$ is at $(24, -22)$. This is North of $Z$.
       The next segment of layer 24 moves UP from $2210$ at $(24, -23)$.
       $X$ is the next number: $2210 + 1 = 2211$. So $X = 2211$.

       $X'$ is at $(24, -21)$. $X' = 2212$.

       $W$ is at $(22, -21)$. This is North-West of $2026$. It is in the region $x \le 23, y \ge -22$.
       $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$. $2027$ is on the UP segment.
       The number West of $2027$ should be $W$.
       If $2027$ is on the edge $x=23$, its West neighbor $W$ is in the interior of the layer structure defined by $x=23$.
       Since $2027$ is on the segment $R(1), U(46)$, its structure is simpler.
       The segment moves up along $x=23$. The numbers just "inside" this segment are not immediately clear.

       Let's use the known property: For $N$ not on a corner, the sum of its neighbors is $8N$, unless the $3 \times 3$ square overlaps with the previous/next layer boundaries significantly.

       $2026$ is on the boundary of the $47 \times 47$ square.
       $N=2026$ is at $(23, -22)$.
       Neighbors $N_i$:
       1. $2027$ (N)
       2. $2209$ (S)
       3. $2025$ (W)
       4. $2211$ (E)
       5. $2208$ (SW)
       6. $2028$ (NW): $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$. $2028$ is at $(23, -20)$? No, $2028$ is at $(23, -20)$. Wait, $2027$ is North of $2026$.
          $2026 \to 2027 \to 2028 \to \ldots \to 2071$.

       The coordinates are $y$: $-22, -21, -20, \ldots, 23$. (46 positions)
       $2026$ at $y=-22$. $2027$ at $y=-21$.

       If we look at the $3 \times 3$ square centered at $2026$:
       \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
       \hline
       $N_{NW}$ & $2027$ & $N_{NE}$ \\
       \hline
       $2025$ & $2026$ & $N_E$ \\
       \hline
       $2208$ & $2209$ & $N_{SE}$ \\
       \hline
       \end{tabular}

       $N_E$ at $(24, -22) = 2211$.
       $N_{SE}$ at $(24, -23) = 2210$. (Wait, $2210$ is the first number in layer 24, at $(24, -23)$).
       $N_{SE}$ is at $(24, -23)$, which is $2210$.

       $N_{SW}$ at $(22, -23) = 2208$.
       $N_S$ at $(23, -23) = 2209$.

       $N_{NW}$ at $(22, -21)$.
       $N_{NE}$ at $(24, -21)$.

       Since $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$ and $2026$ is at $(23, -22)$, the path is moving North.
       The number $W$ West of $2027$ should be $2027 - 1 = 2026$ (No).
       $W$ is West of $2027$. $2027$ is on the edge $x=23$. $W$ is at $x=22$.
       The numbers along $x=23$ are $2026, 2027, 2028, \ldots$.
       The numbers along $x=22$ near $y=-21$ must be in the previous layer's "shadow".

       Since $2026$ is on the edge, the sum property is likely to hold for neighbors *not* crossing the $x=23$ boundary outwards.
       The sum of neighbors for $N$ not on a corner is $\sum N_i = 8N$ if the $3 \times 3$ square is in a region where the function $f(x, y)$ (the value at coordinate $(x, y)$) is locally harmonic.

       Since $2026$ is close to the boundary, let's sum the known 5 neighbors:
       $S_5 = 2027 + 2209 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 = 10680$.
       $5 \times 2026 = 10130$. $S_5$ is significantly higher.

       Let's find $N_{NW} = W$ at $(22, -21)$.
       $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$. $W$ is West of $2027$.
       $2027$ is on the UP segment. The UP segment values are $N_{up}(y) = 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22$.
       $W$ must be the value $N_{in}(y)$ in the interior.
       The interior boundary is $x=22$. The values along $x=22$ (for $y > -22$) should be related to the previous layer.
       Layer 22: $2025$ at $(22, -22)$. Its UP segment starts at $(22, 22)$ and goes $D(44)$ to $(22, -22)$.
       The sequence for layer 22 was $1981, \ldots, 2024$ (Left), $2025$ (Down).
       The number South of $2025$ is $2025 + 45 = 2070$ (Incorrect).

       Let's trust the pattern $8N$ for interior points and see how much $2026$ deviates.
       The deviation is due to the missing neighbors from the left and the presence of neighbors from the right (next layer).

       Neighbors from previous layer (Left side): $2025$ (W), $2208$ (SW). (2 known neighbors)
       Neighbors from next layer (Right side): $2211$ (E), $2210$ (SE). (2 known neighbors)
       Neighbors in same layer (N, S): $2027, 2209$. (2 known neighbors)
       Total 6 neighbors known: $2025, 2208, 2211, 2210, 2027, 2209$. Sum $= 13400$.

       We need $N_{NW}$ at $(22, -21)$ and $N_{NE}$ at $(24, -21)$.

       $N_{NE}$ at $(24, -21)$ is the next element in the UP sequence of the next layer: $2211 + 1 = 2212$.

       $N_{NW}$ at $(22, -21)$. This is West of $2027$. $2027$ is on the boundary $x=23$.
       The value $W$ at $(22, -21)$ should be close to $2027$.
       $2027$ is $2026 + 1$. The value $W$ should be $2026 - 1$ if the pattern was perfectly linear in $x$.
       Since $2025$ is West of $2026$, the value West of $2027$ is likely $2025 + 1 = 2026$ (No).

       In the spiral grid, the relationship is that the difference between $N$ and its North neighbor is 1 or $2k-1$ or $2k$.
       $2027 - 2026 = 1$.
       The number $W$ at $(22, -21)$ is West of $2027$.
       The number $2026$ is on the right edge of the previous square region.
       The numbers on the right edge of the $45 \times 45$ square are $2025, 2026, \ldots$ (Incorrect).
       The numbers on the left edge of the $47 \times 47$ square are $2071, 2072, \ldots, 2117$.

       The sum of neighbors of $N$ on the inner edge of a layer (like $2026$) is $8N - 4k$, where $k$ is the layer size parameter. Here $k=23$.
       The known sum of the 6 neighbors is $13400$.
       $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

       $N_{NW} + N_{NE} = 2 N_{avg}$.
       If $N_{NW} = N_{NE}$, then $N_{NW} = (16208 - 13400)/2 = 2808/2 = 1404$. (Implies the numbers are too small).

       Since $2026$ is on the right edge of the inner square ($x=22$), its West neighbors are known values from the inner structure, and East neighbors are the new layer.
       The two missing neighbors, $N_{NW}$ and $N_{NE}$, are on the line $y=-21$.
       $2027$ is at $(23, -21)$. $2027$ is on the UP segment.

       The number $W$ at $(22, -21)$ is the number directly West of $2027$.
       If $2027$ was in the center, $W = 2027 - 1 = 2026$. But $2026$ is South of $2027$.

       The pattern is highly symmetric for interior points. $2026$ is almost symmetric.
       The difference between the value $N$ and the average of its 8 neighbors $\bar{N}$ is related to its position.
       For a number $N$ on the edge of the $k$-th square (side $2k+1$), the sum of neighbors is $8N \pm (2k+1)$.

       Consider the number $N$ that is $2k$ steps away from a corner. $2026$ is 1 step away from $2025$.

       Sum of 8 neighbors for $N=2026$ is:
       $S = (2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208) + (2211 + 2210 + 2212) + N_{NW}$. (7 known, 1 unknown).
       Wait, $N_{NW}$ and $N_{NE}$ are the unknowns.
       $S = (2025 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210) + (2027 + 2211 + 2212) + N_{NW}$. (7 known, 1 unknown).

       We established $N_{NE} = 2212$.
       $S_{7} = 2025 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2027 + 2211 + 2212 = 15802$.
       $N_{NW}$ at $(22, -21)$. This is West of $2027$.
       $2027$ is on the segment $2026 \to 2071$. This segment is on $x=23$.
       The West neighbor $N_{NW}$ must be a number in the $45 \times 45$ square structure.
       The value at $(22, -21)$ should be $2025 + 1 = 2026$ (No, $2026$ is South).
       The value at $(22, -22)$ is $2025$.
       The value at $(22, -21)$ is $2025 + 45 = 2070$ (If $2025$ was the start of the UP segment of layer 22).

       Layer 22 UP segment: $1980$ at $(22, 22) \to 2024$ at $(22, -22)$. Wait, $2025$ is the end of the DOWN segment.

       The value West of $2027$ at $(23, -21)$ is $2027 - 1 = 2026$ (if the spiral was perfectly laid out).
       $2026$ is South of $2027$. So $N_{NW}$ must be $2026$.
       $N_{NW} = 2026$.

       Sum $S = 15802 + 2026 = 17828$.

       Check the property for $N=9$ (Bottom Right corner, $k=1$). Neighbors: $8, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. Sum $= 36 = 4 \times 9$.
       Check $N=5$ (Top Left corner). Neighbors sum to $32 = 8 \times 4$.

       The sum of neighbors for $N$ on the edge of the $k$-th layer is $8N \pm 2k$.
       For $N=2026$, $k=23$. $2k = 46$.
       If $S = 8N - 46 = 16208 - 46 = 16162$.
       If $S = 8N + 46 = 16208 + 46 = 16254$.

       Our calculated sum is $17828$. This suggests the symmetry approximation is not directly applicable here.

Final list of neighbors based on coordinates:
$N=2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
$2026$ & $2027$ & $2212$ \\
\hline
$2025$ & $2026$ & $2211$ \\
\hline
$2208$ & $2209$ & $2210$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Wait, the table above has $2026$ in the center. The neighbors are:
NW: $N_{NW}$ at $(22, -21) = 2026$
N: $2027$
NE: $2212$
W: $2025$
E: $2211$
SW: $2208$
S: $2209$
SE: $2210$

Sum $= 2026 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 = 17828$.
