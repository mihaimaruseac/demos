Solution:
The natural numbers are written on a square grid in a spiral pattern. We need to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

First, we need to determine the layer of the spiral in which the number 2026 lies. The layers are concentric squares around the center number 1. The side length of the $k$-th layer (the square containing numbers up to $(2k+1)^2$) is $2k+1$. The largest number in the $k$-th layer is $M_k = (2k+1)^2$.

We find $k$ such that $M_{k-1} < 2026 \le M_k$.
We look for the smallest integer $k$ such that $(2k+1)^2 \ge 2026$.
$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011$.
Since $2k+1$ must be an odd integer, we look for the smallest odd integer $\ge 45.011$, which is 47.
So, $2k+1 = 47$, which means $2k = 46$, and $k = 23$.

The number 2026 is on the 23rd layer.
The largest number in the 23rd layer is $M_{23} = (2(23)+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$.
The largest number in the 22nd layer is $M_{22} = (2(22)+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.

Since $2025 < 2026 \le 2025$, the number 2026 is just after 2025, which is the bottom-right corner of the 22nd layer square.

Let's analyze the location of $N = 2025$ and $N+1 = 2026$.
The number $N = (2k-1)^2$ is located at the bottom-right corner of the $(k-1)$-th layer square. In our case, $2025 = 45^2$, so $2k-1 = 45$, $k=23$. This is the corner of the $(k-1)=22$-nd layer.
The side length of this square is $2(22)+1 = 45$.

The corners of the $(k-1)$-th layer (side length $2(k-1)+1$) are:
Bottom-Right (BR): $(2(k-1)+1)^2 = M_{k-1}$. Here $k-1=22$, so $45^2 = 2025$.
Bottom-Left (BL): $2025 - 45 + 1 = 1981$.
Top-Left (TL): $1981 - 45 + 1 = 1937$.
Top-Right (TR): $1937 - 45 + 1 = 1893$.

The numbers on the 22nd layer go from $43^2+1 = 1850$ to $45^2 = 2025$.
The sequence of writing is:
1. Move left from BR to BL (45 steps).
2. Move up from BL to TL (45 steps).
3. Move right from TL to TR (45 steps).
4. Move down from TR to the start of the next layer (45 steps).

Let $L = 2(22)+1 = 45$.
The numbers on the 22nd layer range from $43^2+1 = 1850$ to $45^2 = 2025$.
The number $2025$ is the bottom-right corner.
The number $2026$ is the next number, which starts the 23rd layer.

The number $2025$ is at position $(23, 23)$ if we use coordinates $(x, y)$ with center $(0, 0)$ for the 1. The center $1$ is at $(0, 0)$. The side length of the $k$-th square is $2k+1$. The coordinates of the corners of the square containing numbers up to $(2k+1)^2$ are $(\pm k, \pm k)$.
For $45^2=2025$, $2k-1=45$, $k=23$. This is the bottom-right corner of the $22$-nd layer. The coordinates are $(22, -22)$.

The number $2026$ is the first number of the next segment, which means it moves in the direction opposite to the one that ended at 2025. The spiral moves counterclockwise.
The sequence around $2025$:
... $\leftarrow 2023 \leftarrow 2024 \leftarrow 2025 \leftarrow 2026 \rightarrow 2027 \rightarrow \dots$
The path ends at BR (2025) by moving up. The next number starts moving right.
The number $2025$ is at the corner where the path changes from moving up to moving right.

Layer $k=22$ is the square with size $45 \times 45$.
The path to $2025=45^2$:
The path ends at the bottom-right corner. The previous step was upwards.
The order of movement for layer $k-1=22$:
Start: $43^2+1 = 1850$ is near the top-right.
1. Left along the top edge (44 steps, up to $1850+44 = 1894$).
2. Down along the left edge (44 steps, up to $1894+44 = 1938$).
3. Right along the bottom edge (44 steps, up to $1938+44 = 1982$).
4. Up along the right edge (44 steps, up to $1982+44 = 2026$). Wait, this is not correct.

Let's use the standard Ulam spiral path:
The number $M_k = (2k+1)^2$ is at the bottom-right corner.
$M_{22} = 2025$ is at the bottom-right corner of the $45 \times 45$ square. Its coordinates are $(22, -22)$.
The path to reach 2025: The last segment was moving up along the right edge.
The number before 2025 is $2025 - 1 = 2024$. This number is one step above 2025, so its coordinates are $(22, -21)$.
The number $2026$ is the next number, which starts the new layer $k=23$. The path changes direction to the right.
The coordinates of $2026$ will be $(22, -23)$ (one step to the right of $(22, -22)$ in the standard orientation, but the spiral turns counterclockwise).

Let's analyze the neighbors of $M_k = (2k+1)^2$ at the BR corner $(k, -k)$.
The segment ending at $M_k$ comes from $(k, -k+1)$ (one step above).
The next segment starts at $M_k+1$ and moves right to $(k+1, -k)$.

For $2025 = 45^2$, $k=22$. Corner $(22, -22)$.
The neighbors of $2025$:
Up: $2025 - (2(22)+1) = 2025 - 45 = 1980$. (This is not correct, the distance is $2k$).
The distance between numbers on the same edge is 1. The distance between opposite corners is $2 \times (2k+1) - 2 = 4k$. No.

The numbers on the perimeter of the $45 \times 45$ square are $2025$ down to $1850$. The side length is 45. There are $4 \times 45 - 4 = 176$ numbers on the perimeter. $2025 - 1850 + 1 = 176$.

The neighbors of a number $N$ at $(x, y)$ are $(x \pm 1, y)$, $(x, y \pm 1)$, and the four diagonals.

Since $2026$ is $2025+1$, it is the first number of the next layer $47 \times 47$.
The coordinates of $2025$ are $(22, -22)$.
The path to $2025$ moved up along the right edge. The next step is to the right.
$2026$ is at $(23, -22)$. This is the new bottom-right corner of the $47 \times 47$ square, but this is not the first number of the layer.

The square ends at $2025$. The next number $2026$ is the start of the outer layer.
The path of the spiral dictates that if the last step was along a side, the next step is a turn.
$2025$ is the BR corner, arrived from UP. The turn is to the RIGHT.
$2026$ is one step to the RIGHT of $2025$.
Coordinates of 2025: $(22, -22)$.
Coordinates of 2026: $(23, -22)$. (The layer index $k$ increases by 1).

The 8 neighbors of $N=2026$ at $(x, y) = (23, -22)$ are:
1. Left: $(22, -22)$. This is $2025$.
2. Right: $(24, -22)$. This is $2026 + (2(23)+1) = 2026 + 47 = 2073$ (The number at the next BR corner). No, this is $2026 + 2 \times 46 = 2026 + 92$.
The side length of the current layer is $2(22)+1=45$. The side length of the next layer is $2(23)+1=47$.
The number $2026$ is on the square of side length $47$.

The difference between two consecutive numbers on the same side of the square is 1.
The difference between the BR corner of layer $k$ and the BR corner of layer $k+1$ is $(2(k+1)+1)^2 - (2k+1)^2 = (2k+3)^2 - (2k+1)^2 = 4(2k+2) = 8k+8$.

Let $N=2026$. $N$ is in the square of size $47 \times 47$, which has largest number $47^2=2209$.
$N=2026$ is on the edge of the square. Since it follows $2025$ (BR corner), it moves right.
The movement around $2026$ is:
$2025 \leftarrow 2026 \rightarrow 2027$ (moving right).

The neighbors of $N$ are:
1. Left neighbor: $N-1 = 2025$.
2. Right neighbor: $N+1 = 2027$.

The neighbors vertically aligned with $N$:
The distance between the number $N$ and the number directly above or below it is the width of the layer, $2k+1 = 47$.
The number above $N$ is $N - 47 = 2026 - 47 = 1979$.
The number below $N$ is $N + 47 = 2026 + 47 = 2073$.

The neighbors diagonally aligned with $N$:
The diagonal neighbors are $N \pm 46$ and $N \pm 48$.
The number $N$ is on the bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square. The bottom edge is where the $y$-coordinate is $-23$.
The BR corner is $2209$ at $(23, -23)$.
The path around $2209$ is: Up to $2208$, Left to $2205$, Down to $2161$, Right to $2162$, Up to $2206$, Left to $2207$, Down to $2208$, Right to $2209$. No, the path is fixed.

The sequence around $2209=47^2$ (BR corner, coordinates $(23, -23)$):
The last step was moving UP along the right edge.
The number $2208$ is at $(23, -22)$ (one up).
The number $2207$ is at $(22, -22)$ (one left of 2208). No, this is wrong.

If $N$ is on the perimeter, its neighbors are:
If $N$ is not a corner, two neighbors are $\pm 1$ away, and two are $\pm (2k+1)$ away, and four are $\pm (2k)$ or $\pm (2k+2)$ away.

$N=2026$ is the first number of the 23rd layer, so it is on the bottom edge of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The bottom edge goes from $2026$ to $2209$.
The numbers on the bottom edge are $2026, 2027, \dots, 2209$.
The length of this segment is $2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184$.
The side length is $47$. This segment is not a full side.

The BR corner is $2209$. The next corner CCW is BL at $2209 - 47 + 1 = 2163$.
The segment from BL to BR has length $47-1 = 46$.
The segment from BL to BR moves right.
$2163 \rightarrow 2164 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow 2209$. This segment has $2209 - 2163 + 1 = 47$ numbers.

The segment before $2163$ (BL) is the left edge, moving down.
The TL corner is $2163 - 47 + 1 = 2117$.
The segment from TL to BL moves down. $2117 \rightarrow 2118 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow 2163$. This segment has 47 numbers.

The segment before $2117$ (TL) is the top edge, moving left.
The TR corner is $2117 - 47 + 1 = 2071$.
The segment from TR to TL moves left. $2071 \rightarrow 2072 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow 2117$. This segment has 47 numbers.

The segment before $2071$ (TR) is the right edge, moving up.
The number before $2071$ is $2070$. The segment from BR of layer 22 ($2025$) to TR of layer 23 ($2071$) moves up.
$2025$ is at the bottom-right. The path goes UP along the right edge.
The numbers are $2026, 2027, \dots, 2071$. This segment has $2071 - 2026 + 1 = 46$ numbers.
This segment is part of the right edge. It has length 46. The side length is 47.
The number $2026$ is one step above $2025$. $2025$ is at the corner $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$. This is on the right edge.

The neighbors of $N=2026$ at $(22, -21)$:
1. Right: $N+1 = 2027$. (Moves along the edge).
2. Left: $N-1 = 2025$. (The previous layer's corner).

3. Above (Up): The next number on the edge is $2026 + 47 = 2073$ (if it were a full segment).
The number directly above $N$ is $N - (2k+1)$ only if $N$ is at the top edge.
Since $N$ is on the right edge, the number above it is $N - (2(22)+1) = N-45$ if it were on the previous layer.

Let's use the coordinate system with $k=23$. $N=2026$ is on the square of size $47 \times 47$.
$2026$ is on the right edge, one step up from $2025$. Coordinates of $2025$ are $(22, -22)$.
$2026$ is at $(22, -21)$.

Neighbors of $(22, -21)$:
1. Right: $(23, -21)$. This is $N+1 = 2027$.
2. Left: $(21, -21)$. This is $N-1 = 2025$.

3. Up: $(22, -20)$. This is on the same edge, so it is $N + 1 = 2027$. Wait, the path is UP.
The path around $2026$: $2025 \leftarrow 2026 \nearrow 2027$. No.

Since $2026$ is on the right edge moving up, the neighbors are:
1. Up: $N+1 = 2027$. (Moves along the edge).
2. Down: $N-1 = 2025$. (The previous number).

3. Left (inward): The number one step left and one step up/down from $N$.
The number to the left of $N$ (inward) is $N - (2(22)) = N - 44$. This is $2026 - 44 = 1982$. (This is the number at the left edge of the previous layer, $45^2$).

Let's verify the positions around $2025=45^2$ at $(22, -22)$.
The neighbors of $2025$ are:
Up: $2026$ (New layer starts).
Down: $2025 - 45 = 1980$ (Bottom edge of layer 22).
Left: $2024$ (Right edge of layer 22).
Right: $2025 + 45 = 2070$ (Right edge of layer 22). No, $2025 + (2(22)) = 2069$.

The distance between opposite sides of the $45 \times 45$ square is $45$.
$2025$ is at the bottom-right corner.
The number directly above it is $2025 - 44 = 1981$ (Left corner of the right edge). Wrong.

Let $C_k = (2k-1)^2$. $C_{23} = 2025$.
The neighbors of $C_k$ are:
1. $C_k-1$: Left of $C_k$ along the edge.
2. $C_k-(2k-2)$: Above $C_k$ along the edge.
3. $C_k+(2k-2)$: Below $C_k$ along the edge.
4. $C_k+(2k-1)^2 - (2k-3)^2 = 8k-8$.

The key is that $2026$ is on the outer edge of the spiral, where the difference between neighbors is either 1 or $2 \times (\text{side length of inner square}) + 1$ or $2 \times (\text{side length of outer square}) - 1$.

Since $2026$ is on the outer edge ($47 \times 47$ square):
1. Neighbors along the edge: $2025$ (back) and $2027$ (forward).
2. Neighbors perpendicular to the edge (inward):
The width of the layer is $47$. The distance between parallel sides is $47$.
The number inwards from $2026$ is $2026 - 47 = 1979$.
The number outwards from $2026$ is $2026 + 47 = 2073$.

3. Diagonal neighbors: These are $\pm 46$ or $\pm 48$ away.
The diagonal neighbors are $2026 \pm 46$ and $2026 \pm 48$.
$2026 - 46 = 1980$.
$2026 + 46 = 2072$.
$2026 - 48 = 1978$.
$2026 + 48 = 2074$.

The 8 neighbors of $N=2026$ are:
$N-1 = 2025$
$N+1 = 2027$
$N-47 = 1979$ (Inward, perpendicular)
$N+47 = 2073$ (Outward, perpendicular)
$N-46 = 1980$ (Diagonal)
$N+46 = 2072$ (Diagonal)
$N-48 = 1978$ (Diagonal)
$N+48 = 2074$ (Diagonal)

Sum of the 8 neighbors:
Sum $= (2025 + 2027) + (1979 + 2073) + (1980 + 2072) + (1978 + 2074)$
Sum $= 4052 + 4052 + 4052 + 4052$
Sum $= 4 \times 4052 = 16208$.

Final check on the structure of neighbors for a number $N$ on the outer edge of a square of size $S \times S$ (where $S=47$ for $N=2026$):
The neighbors are $N \pm 1$, $N \pm S$, $N \pm (S-1)$, $N \pm (S+1)$.
Here $S=47$.
Neighbors: $N \pm 1, N \pm 47, N \pm 46, N \pm 48$.
Sum $= (N-1 + N+1) + (N-47 + N+47) + (N-46 + N+46) + (N-48 + N+48)$
Sum $= 2N + 2N + 2N + 2N = 8N$.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is $8 \times 2026$.
$8 \times 2026 = 8 \times (2000 + 26) = 16000 + 8 \times 26 = 16000 + 208 = 16208$.

This general formula $8N$ holds if $N$ is not a corner number.
We need to confirm that $N=2026$ is not a corner number of the $47 \times 47$ square.
The corner numbers are:
BR: $2209 = 47^2$.
BL: $2209 - 47 + 1 = 2163$.
TL: $2163 - 47 + 1 = 2117$.
TR: $2117 - 47 + 1 = 2071$.

Since $2026$ is not one of $\{2209, 2163, 2117, 2071\}$, the formula $8N$ is correct.
