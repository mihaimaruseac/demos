Let $n$ be a natural number. The neighbors of $n$ in the spiral are the eight numbers around $n$ in the square grid.
Let the spiral be defined such that 1 is at the center. Then the numbers increase as the spiral goes outward.
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
Let's find the position of 2026 in the spiral. Since the spiral starts at the center, we need to find the layer number that contains 2026.
The $k$-th layer has $4(2k-1)$ numbers, where $k$ is the layer number starting from the center layer (layer 1).
Let $L_k$ be the total number of numbers in the first $k$ layers. Then $L_k = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} 4(2i-1) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} (8i-4) = 1 + 8\sum_{i=1}^{k} i - 4\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1 = 1 + 8\frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 4k = 1 + 4k(k+1) - 4k = 1 + 4k^2 + 4k - 4k = 1 + 4k^2$.
We want to find $k$ such that $1 + 4k^2 \approx 2026$.
$4k^2 \approx 2025$, so $k^2 \approx \frac{2025}{4} = 506.25$. Then $k \approx \sqrt{506.25} \approx 22.5$.
Let $k=22$. Then $1 + 4(22^2) = 1 + 4(484) = 1 + 1936 = 1937$.
Let $k=23$. Then $1 + 4(23^2) = 1 + 4(529) = 1 + 2116 = 2117$.
So 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
The numbers in the 23rd layer range from 1937 to 2117.
The numbers in the 23rd layer form a square of size $45 \times 45$ with the number 1 at the center.
Since 2026 is in the 23rd layer, we know that it is in the outer layer of a $45 \times 45$ square.
The number 2026 is $2026 - 1936 = 90$ numbers away from the start of the layer. The start of the layer is 1937, so 2026 is the 90th number in the 23rd layer.
The total number of numbers in the 23rd layer is $4(2(23)-1) = 4(46-1) = 4(45) = 180$.
Since 2026 is the 90th number in the layer, it is approximately in the middle of one side of the square.
Let $n = 2026$. The neighbors of $n$ are $n-1$, $n+1$, $n-45$, $n+45$, $n-46$, $n-44$, $n+44$, $n+46$.
The sum of the neighbors is $n-1+n+1+n-45+n+45+n-46+n+46+n-44+n+44 = 8n = 8(2026) = 16208$.

Let's write the numbers in the spiral.
We have a $45 \times 45$ grid, with 1 at the center.
The number 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
The number 1 is at $(23, 23)$.
The numbers in the 23rd layer start at 1937.
We need to find the coordinates of 2026.
2026 is the 90th number in the 23rd layer.
The layer starts at the right side of the grid. The right side has 45 numbers.
The top side has 44 numbers.
The left side has 44 numbers.
The bottom side has 44 numbers.
So the total is $45 + 44 + 44 + 44 = 45 + 3(44) = 45 + 132 = 177 < 180$.
So 2026 is on the bottom side.
The number 1937 is at $(45, 23)$.
The top right corner is at $(45, 1)$. The top left corner is at $(1, 1)$. The bottom left corner is at $(1, 45)$. The bottom right corner is at $(45, 45)$.
$1937 \to 1938 \to ... \to 1981$. These are the numbers on the right side. $1981 - 1937 = 44$.
$1982 \to 2025$. These are the numbers on the top side. $2025 - 1982 = 43$.
$2026$. 2026 is on the left side.
So 2026 is at $(22, 1)$. 2025 is at $(1, 1)$.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers to the top, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left, top-left.
Since the number 2026 is on the outer boundary, the grid representation doesn't directly apply to finding its neighbors.
The coordinates of 2026 are $(23 - (2026 - 1981), 1) = (23 - 45, 1) = (-22, 1)$.
The neighbors are $(22, 1), (24, 1), (23, 0), (23, 2), ...$
The numbers are $2025, 2027, 1, ...$

The sum of the neighbors is $8n = 8(2026) = 16208$.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
