Let the spiral start with 1 in the center.
1 is in the (0,0) position.
2 is to the right of 1, at (1,0).
3 is above 2, at (1,1).
4 is to the left of 3, at (0,1).
5 is below 4, at (-1,1).
6 is to the left of 5, at (-1,0).
7 is below 6, at (-1,-1).
8 is to the right of 7, at (0,-1).
9 is to the right of 8, at (1,-1).

The numbers increase in a spiral pattern.
If $n$ is an odd number, then $n^2$ is at the bottom right of a square.
1 is $1^2$ at (0,0).
9 is $3^2$ at (1,-1).
25 is $5^2$ at (2,-2).
49 is $7^2$ at (3,-3).
...
$(2k+1)^2$ is at (k,-k).
The number 2026 is close to $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
Thus, we should consider $45^2 = 2025$ and $46^2 = 2116$.
$45 = 2k+1$, so $2k = 44$ and $k=22$.
Thus, 2025 is at (22,-22).
2026 is to the right of 2025, so it is at (23,-22).
Then the coordinates of the 8 neighbors are:
(22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23)
(22,-22), , (24,-22)
(22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21)

To find the numbers at those coordinates, we first find the side length of the square that contains 2026.
The square containing 2026 has side length $2(23) = 46$, since 2026 is in the 23rd row.
The last number in that square is $47^2 = 2209$ at (23,-23).
The number at (23,-22) is 2026.
The number at (23,-23) is 2025.
The number at (22,-22) is 2025.
The number at (22,-23) is $45^2 + (45-22+23) = 2025 + 46 = 2071$.
The number at (24,-22) is 2027.
The number at (24,-23) is 2025+2 = 2027.
2025 is at (22,-22). 2024 is to the left of 2025, at (21,-22).
The coordinates of 2026 are (23,-22).
2025 = (22,-22)
Then 2024, 2023, ..., 2021, 2020, 2019, ...
Then 2071, 2070, ..., 2068, 2067, 2066, ...

The number at (22,-23) is 2071.
The number at (23,-23) is 2209.
The number at (24,-23) is ?
The number at (22,-22) is 2025.
The number at (24,-22) is 2027.
The number at (22,-21) is ?
The number at (23,-21) is ?
The number at (24,-21) is ?

Numbers are 2025 at (22,-22), 2026 at (23,-22).
2027 is at (24,-22).
The square spiral is of size $46 \times 46$.
The values of neighbors around 2026 are:
Top left: $2026 + 23+23+1 = 2073$
Top middle: $2026 + 46+1 = 2073$
Top right: $2026 + 23+23+1 = 2073$
Left: 2025
Right: 2027
Bottom left: 1980-
Bottom middle: 1980-
Bottom right: 1980-

Neighbors: 2072, 2073, 2074, 2025, 2027, 1978, 1979, 1980.
$2072+2073+2074+2025+2027+1978+1979+1980 = 16208$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
