Let the numbers on the spiral be arranged in a square grid.
The number 1 is in the center of the grid.
The spiral starts from 1 and goes right to 2, then up to 3, then left to 4, 5, then down to 6, 7, then right to 8, 9, ...

We can label the grid with coordinates (x, y) where 1 is at (0, 0).
2 is at (1, 0), 3 is at (1, 1), 4 is at (0, 1), 5 is at (-1, 1), 6 is at (-1, 0), 7 is at (-1, -1), 8 is at (0, -1), 9 is at (1, -1).
Let's observe the pattern of the numbers in the spiral.
1 is at (0, 0).
The numbers increase in a spiral pattern.

We need to find the coordinates of the number 2026.
First, we can find the "layer" that contains 2026.
The numbers on the rightmost side are squares of odd numbers: $1, 9, 25, 49, 81, \dots, (2n-1)^2$.
We have $(2n-1)^2 \approx 2026$, so $2n-1 \approx \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$, $2n \approx 46$, $n \approx 23$.
Thus, $45^2 = 2025$ and $47^2 = 2209$. So 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
Since $45^2 = 2025$ is the bottom right corner, 2025 is at (22, -22). Then 2026 is to the left of 2025, so it is at (21, -22).

We can check some layers:
n = 1, $1 = (2(1)-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1$ at (0, 0)
n = 2, $3^2 = 9$ at (1, -1). The previous numbers are 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
n = 3, $5^2 = 25$ at (2, -2).
n = 4, $7^2 = 49$ at (3, -3).
n = 5, $9^2 = 81$ at (4, -4).

So we have 2025 at (22, -22).
2026 is at (21, -22).
Neighbors are at:
(20, -23), (21, -23), (22, -23),
(20, -22), (22, -22),
(20, -21), (21, -21), (22, -21)

The numbers around 2025 are:
... 2024 2023 2022 ...
... 2027 1 2021 ...
... 2028 2029 2030 ...

The numbers near 2025 are: 2026, 2027, 2028, ..., 2025 + 4(45) = 2205.
2025 is at (22, -22).
2026 is at (21, -22).

The neighbors of 2026 are at:
(20, -23), (21, -23), (22, -23),
(20, -22), (22, -22),
(20, -21), (21, -21), (22, -21)

We can deduce the values by following the spiral backward from 2025.
(22, -22) = 2025
(21, -22) = 2026
(20, -22) = 2027
(20, -21) = 2028
(21, -21) = 2029
(22, -21) = 2030
(22, -20) = 2031
...

We know 2025 is at (22, -22).
2026 is at (21, -22).
Neighbors are:
(20, -21), (21, -21), (22, -21),
(20, -22),          (22, -22),
(20, -23), (21, -23), (22, -23)
So we have: 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, ...

2026 is at (21, -22)
The sum of neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + a + b + c + d + e + f = x

Sum = 8*2026 = 16208
Consider the difference from 2026:
-1, 1, a', b', c', d', e', f'

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
