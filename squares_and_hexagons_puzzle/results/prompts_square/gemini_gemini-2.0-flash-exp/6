Let the spiral be arranged such that 1 is at the center (0,0). We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026. First, we need to determine the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we can approximate the position of 2026. The numbers in the spiral grow outward from the center.
The numbers in the spiral increase in squares.
1 is at (0,0).
9 is the bottom right corner.
25 is the bottom right corner of the next layer.
The numbers in the bottom right corners are squares of odd numbers: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, ...
This sequence is (2n-1)^2 for n=1, 2, 3, ...
We want to find n such that (2n-1)^2 is close to 2026.
(2n-1)^2 <= 2026
2n-1 <= sqrt(2026)
2n-1 <= 45.011
2n <= 46.011
n <= 23.005
Let n = 23. Then (2n-1)^2 = (46-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
Since 2025 is at the bottom right corner, its coordinates are (22, -22).
The number 2026 is to the left of 2025, so its coordinates are (21, -22).
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are:
Above: (21, -23)
Below: (21, -21)
Left: (20, -22)
Right: (22, -22)
Upper left: (20, -23)
Upper right: (22, -23)
Lower left: (20, -21)
Lower right: (22, -21)

Since 2025 is at (22, -22), we have 2025.
2026 is at (21, -22).
The numbers surrounding 2025:
Top: 2024
Bottom: 2026
Left: 2026 is to the left of 2025
The numbers around 2026:
2026 is to the left of 2025.
We can generate the spiral and find the neighbors.
Let $x = 21$ and $y = -22$.
We need to find the numbers at positions $(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)$.

Let the coordinates of 1 be (0,0). The spiral goes 1, 2, 3, ...
For n = 23, 45^2 = 2025 is at (22, -22). 2026 is at (21, -22).
2024 is above 2025, at (22, -23).
The number to the left of 2026 is 2027.
The number below 2026 is 2025.
The number above 2026 is 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030
We need to sum the 8 neighbors of 2026.
The coordinates are (21, -22) for 2026.
We need to find the numbers at (20, -21), (21, -21), (22, -21), (20, -22), (22, -22), (20, -23), (21, -23), (22, -23).
These are 2027, 2025, 2024.
The sum is 16208.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
