Let the square grid be represented by coordinates $(x,y)$ with the center being $(0,0)$, where the number 1 is located.
The numbers increase as we move right, up, left, and down.
Let the number $n$ be located at $(x,y)$. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026. Let the neighbors of $n$ be $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_8$. Then we want to find $\sum_{i=1}^8 n_i$.
The 8 neighbors of the number $n$ at position $(x,y)$ are at positions $(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)$.

If the number 2026 is at position $(x,y)$, then the numbers at the neighboring positions are:
$n_1 = f(x-1, y-1)$, $n_2 = f(x, y-1)$, $n_3 = f(x+1, y-1)$,
$n_4 = f(x-1, y)$, $n_5 = f(x+1, y)$,
$n_6 = f(x-1, y+1)$, $n_7 = f(x, y+1)$, $n_8 = f(x+1, y+1)$,
where $f(x,y)$ is the number at position $(x,y)$. We want to find the sum
$S = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 + n_6 + n_7 + n_8$.

If the spiral pattern started from 1, the average value of the 8 neighbors is approximately 2026.
We can write the sum of the neighbors as
$S = f(x-1, y-1) + f(x, y-1) + f(x+1, y-1) + f(x-1, y) + f(x+1, y) + f(x-1, y+1) + f(x, y+1) + f(x+1, y+1)$.

We can approximate the numbers by assuming they increase linearly. In that case, the numbers around 2026 should be approximately the same. So we can approximate each number by 2026.
$S \approx 8 \times 2026 = 16208$.
The actual sum will be less than this approximation because the neighbors will tend to be smaller than 2026.

The numbers around a square are $n-1, n+1, n-w, n+w, n-w-1, n-w+1, n+w-1, n+w+1$.
If the grid is $2k+1$ by $2k+1$ centered at 1, then the surrounding numbers are
$2026-1, 2026+1, 2026-w, 2026+w, 2026-w-1, 2026-w+1, 2026+w-1, 2026+w+1$.
$S = 8 \times 2026 = 16208$.
If $w=3$, $S = 2025 + 2027 + 2026-3 + 2026+3 + 2026-4 + 2026-2 + 2026+2 + 2026+4 = 8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

Consider the general case for number $n$. Then the sum of the 8 neighbors is
$(n-1) + (n+1) + (n-w) + (n+w) + (n-w-1) + (n-w+1) + (n+w-1) + (n+w+1) = 8n$.
Thus, the sum is $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
