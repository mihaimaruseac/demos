Let's consider the spiral arrangement of the natural numbers:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
The numbers spiral outwards starting from 1 in the center.

We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let's consider the general form of the numbers in the spiral.
We can observe that the odd squares $1, 9, 25, 49, \dots$ are located at the bottom right corner of the spiral.
The odd square $n^2$ is at the bottom right corner. Then the number to the left of $n^2$ is $n^2 - 1$, the number above $n^2 - 1$ is $n^2 - 2$, and so on, until $n^2 - (n-1) = n^2 - n + 1$ is at the top right. Then the number to the left of $n^2 - n + 1$ is $n^2 - n$, and so on, until $n^2 - 2n + 2$ is at the top left. The number below $n^2 - 2n + 2$ is $n^2 - 2n + 3$, and so on, until $n^2 - 3n + 3$ is at the bottom left. The number to the right of $n^2 - 3n + 3$ is $n^2 - 3n + 4$, and so on, until $n^2 - 4n + 4 = (n-2)^2$ is at the center.
We can also see that the number $n^2$ corresponds to the number $(2k+1)^2$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \dots$.
Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, we know that 2025 is in the bottom right corner of a spiral of size $45 \times 45$.

We want to find the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is one more than 2025, it is to the left of 2025. Let $n = 45$. Then 2025 is in the bottom right corner of the $n \times n$ spiral.
Thus, we have 2025, so 2026 is to the left of it.
We want to find the numbers surrounding 2026.
2024 2025
? 2026 ?
? ?

2025 is at $(23, 23)$ counting from the center.
Then 2026 is at $(22, -22)$, and the neighbors are $(22, -23)$, $(23, -23)$, $(23, -22)$, $(23, -21)$, $(22, -21)$, $(21, -21)$, $(21, -22)$, $(21, -23)$.

We can find the position of 2026 in the grid. Since $45^2 = 2025$, we know that 2025 is located at the bottom right corner of a spiral of size $45 \times 45$. Since 2026 is one more than 2025, it is to the left of 2025.
So the numbers surrounding 2026 are:
2027 above
2028
...
Let the 8 neighbors of 2026 be $x_1, \dots, x_8$.
Then the sum of the neighbors is $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_8$.
Since 2026 is to the left of 2025, we have:
  ?   ?   ?
  ? 2026 2025
  ?   ?   ?

The numbers surrounding 2025 are $2024, 2023, 2022, \dots$
Since 2025 is at the bottom right corner,
2024 is to the left, so 2026 is to the left of 2025.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2027
2028
2029
2030
We want to find the numbers around 2026.

Let $a_n$ be the $n$-th number in the spiral.
Since 2026 is one to the left of 2025, the neighbors of 2026 are:
2027, 2025, the 6 other numbers.

Let $S$ be the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026. We know 2025 is to the right of 2026.
Consider the $3 \times 3$ square with 2026 in the middle.
$x_1$ $x_2$ $x_3$
$x_4$ 2026 $x_6$
$x_7$ $x_8$ $x_9$

$x_6 = 2025$.
Since 2026 is to the left of 2025, we have:
2027
2025

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
