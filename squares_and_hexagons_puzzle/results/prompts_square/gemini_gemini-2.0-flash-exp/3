Let the spiral be represented by the coordinates $(x,y)$ in the square grid. The number 1 is at $(0,0)$.
We can describe the spiral as follows:
1 is at $(0,0)$
2 is at $(1,0)$
3 is at $(1,1)$
4 is at $(0,1)$
5 is at $(-1,1)$
6 is at $(-1,0)$
7 is at $(-1,-1)$
8 is at $(0,-1)$
9 is at $(1,-1)$
10 is at $(2,-1)$
...

We can use a coordinate system where the origin is at 1.
For the number $n$, we want to find its coordinates $(x,y)$. We can approximate the position of the number by taking the square root.
$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
We want to find the layer in which 2026 is.
For $n=1$, layer is 0.
For $n=2, \dots, 9$, layer is 1.
For $n=10, \dots, 25$, layer is 2.
For layer $k$, we have the numbers $(2k-1)^2+1$ to $(2k+1)^2$.
In layer $k$, there are $(2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = (4k^2+4k+1) - (4k^2-4k+1) = 8k$ numbers.
We want to find the layer in which 2026 is.
Let's find the smallest square greater than 2026.
$45^2 = 2025$. So $45^2 + 1 = 2026$.
$45 = 2k-1 \Rightarrow 2k=46 \Rightarrow k=23$.
So 2025 is in layer 22, and 2026 is in layer 23.
The lowest number in layer 23 is $(2(23)-1)^2+1 = 45^2+1 = 2025+1=2026$.
So 2026 is at $(23,0)$.
2026 is at $(23,0)$
Then we have the neighbors:
$(22,-1)$
$(23,-1)$
$(24,-1)$
$(22,0)$
$(24,0)$
$(22,1)$
$(23,1)$
$(24,1)$
The sum of the coordinates is $8(23) + 0 = 184$.

We want to find the numbers around 2026.
The numbers are on the spiral:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
2025 is at $(22,-1)$, 2026 is at $(23,0)$, 2027 is at $(23,1)$.
2026 is at the beginning of the bottom row of the layer.
The layer before has $23=k$.
The previous layer has $(2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2(22)+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
The previous layer has $43^2 = 1849$.
So the layer has numbers from 1850 to 2025.
So the previous layer has size 176.
$(2k+1)^2 = (2(22)+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
$(2(23)+1)^2 = (47)^2 = 2209$.
The layer of 2026 has numbers from 2026 to 2209.

We have $(23,0)$.
Neighbors are $(22,-1)$, $(23,-1)$, $(24,-1)$, $(22,0)$, $(24,0)$, $(22,1)$, $(23,1)$, $(24,1)$
2025, 2027, 2028, 2024, 2029, 2023, 2030, 2031.
The sum is $2025+2027+2028+2024+2029+2023+2030+2031 = 16217$.

We can find the surrounding numbers:
$n-1, n+1$
The numbers above are less than $n$.
The numbers below are greater than $n$.
Let's consider 2026 to be 1.
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
2025 is $45^2 = 2025$.
The previous numbers are $2025, 2024, 2023$.
The next numbers are $2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031$.
The numbers $2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031$ are the neighbors of 2026.
$2025+2024+2023+2027+2028+2029+2030+2031 = 16217$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16217}$
