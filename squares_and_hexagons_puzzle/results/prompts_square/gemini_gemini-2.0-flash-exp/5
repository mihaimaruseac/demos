Let the spiral start with 1 in the center.
We can think of the spiral as expanding squares.
The first square is just 1.
The second square has the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The side length of the first square is 1.
The side length of the second square is 3.
The third square will have a side length of 5.

The nth square will have a side length of $2n-1$.
The number of terms in the nth square is $(2n-1)^2$.
We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \ge 2026$.
$2n-1 \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$
$2n \ge 46$
$n \ge 23$

So, 2026 is in the 23rd square.
The number of terms in the 22nd square is $(2(22)-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$.
2026 - 1849 = 177
This is the 177th term in the 23rd square.
The 23rd square has side length $2(23)-1 = 45$.

The first number in the 23rd square is 1850.
If we start in the top right corner, we move left.
The total number of elements in the 23rd square is $45^2 = 2025$.

Let's find the position of 2026.
1850 is in the top right corner.
Going left, we have $1850, 1851, 1852, ..., 1894$.
So 45 terms.
Next we go down, with $1895, 1896, ..., 1939$.
So 45 terms.
Next we go left, with $1940, ..., 1984$.
So 45 terms.
Next we go up, with $1985, ..., 2029$.
So 45 terms.
The last number in the 23rd square is 2025.

The numbers go $1850, ..., 1894$ (45 terms)
$1895, ..., 1939$ (45 terms)
$1940, ..., 1984$ (45 terms)
$1985, ..., 2029$ (45 terms)
$2030, ..., 2073$ (44 terms)
So, the numbers go right, down, left, up, right, down, ...

Since 2026 - 1849 = 177.
The first 45 terms are on the top row.
The next 45 terms are on the right side.
The next 45 terms are on the bottom row.
$177 = 45+45+45+42$
So 2026 is the 42nd term on the left side.
Then 2026 is in the 23rd square, on the left side, 42 units from the bottom.

We have that the center is (0,0). The top right corner of the 23rd square is (22,22).
1850 is at (22,22). We move left 44 spaces to (-22, 22). Then we move down 44 spaces to (-22, -22).
We move left 44 spaces to (-22,-22). 2026 is 42 up from (-22,-22). So we have (-22, -22+42) = (-22, 20).
Then we have
2025 2024 2023
2027 2026 2022
2028 2029 2030
2025+2024+2023+2027+2022+2028+2029+2030 = 16188

Alternatively,
2026 is at (-22, 20).
Let $S$ be the sum of the 8 neighbors.
$S = 8(2026) = 16208$.
Let the numbers be $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$.
The numbers surrounding $n$ is $n-s, n-s+1, n+1, n+s+1, n+s, n+s-1, n-1, n-s-1$.
If we sum these, we get $8n$.
$8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
