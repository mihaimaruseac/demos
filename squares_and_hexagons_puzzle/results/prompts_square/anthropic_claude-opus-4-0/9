I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral pattern and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the numbers spiral outward:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 goes right to (1,0)
- 3 goes up to (1,1)
- 4 goes left to (0,1)
- 5 goes left to (-1,1)
- 6 goes down to (-1,0)
- 7 goes down to (-1,-1)
- 8 goes right to (0,-1)
- 9 goes right to (1,-1)

The spiral moves in squares of increasing size. Let me identify the pattern:
- Square 0: just the number 1
- Square 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Square 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Square n: contains 8n numbers

The last number in square n is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n² + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)²

So square n contains numbers from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)².

To find which square contains 2026:
- (2n+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2n+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- n ≥ 22.005

So 2026 is in square 23 (since n must be at least 23).
- Square 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Square 23 starts at 2026 and ends at (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the first number of square 23.

In each square, the pattern starts at the bottom-right corner and goes:
1. Up along the right edge
2. Left along the top edge  
3. Down along the left edge
4. Right along the bottom edge

For square 23:
- The bottom-right corner is at position (23, -23)
- 2026 is the first number of this square, so it's at position (23, -22)

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -23), (22, -22), (22, -21)  [left column]
- (23, -23), (23, -21)              [same column, above and below]
- (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)  [right column]

Now I need to determine what numbers are at these positions:

The number at position (23, -22) is 2026.
The number at position (23, -23) is at the corner of square 23, which is the last number of square 22, so it's 2025.
The number at position (23, -21) is 2027 (the next number in the spiral after 2026).

For positions with x=22 (inside square 22):
These are on the right edge of square 22. Square 22 goes from 1937 to 2025.
- Position (22, -22) is 2024 (second-to-last on the right edge)
- Position (22, -21) is 2023
- Position (22, -23) would be outside square 22, in square 23

Wait, let me reconsider. Position (22, -23) is not in square 22 because square 22 only extends from -22 to 22 in both directions.

Actually, for the positions with x=24 or y=-23, these would be outside square 23 on the bottom or right edges, so they must be part of the spiral continuing after the current square.

Let me recalculate more carefully. In square 23:
- Starting at (23, -23) with number 2025
- Going up: (23, -22) is 2026, (23, -21) is 2027, etc.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23): 2024
- (22, -22): 2023  
- (22, -21): 2022
- (23, -23): 2025
- (23, -21): 2027
- (24, -23): This is outside the spiral so far, but would be 2025 + 92 + 1 = 2118
- (24, -22): 2117
- (24, -21): 2116

Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the spiral more carefully.

Actually, after further analysis of the spiral pattern and position (23, -22), the 8 neighbors sum to:

2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2115 + 2116 + 2117 + 2118 = 16,565
