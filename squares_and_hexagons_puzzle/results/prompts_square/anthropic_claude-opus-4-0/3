I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 is at position (1,0) - one step right
- 3 is at position (1,1) - one step up
- 4 is at position (0,1) - one step left
- 5 is at position (-1,1) - one step left
- 6 is at position (-1,0) - one step down
- 7 is at position (-1,-1) - one step down
- 8 is at position (0,-1) - one step right
- 9 is at position (1,-1) - one step right

The spiral moves: right, up, left-left, down-down, right-right-right, up-up-up, left-left-left-left, etc.

Let me identify the pattern more clearly. The spiral forms square rings:
- Ring 0: just the number 1
- Ring 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring k: contains 8k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So I need to find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring k ends at (2k+1)²
- I need (2k+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2k+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- k ≥ 22.005

So 2026 is in ring 23 (since ring 22 ends at 45² = 2025 and ring 23 ends at 47² = 2209).

Since ring 22 ends at 2025, number 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

In each ring, the pattern starts by going right from the bottom-right corner of the previous ring. The bottom-right corner of ring 22 (number 2025) is at position (22, -22).

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -23): Need to find what number is here
- (22, -22): This is 2025
- (22, -21): Need to find what number is here
- (23, -23): Need to find what number is here
- (23, -21): This is 2027
- (24, -23): Need to find what number is here
- (24, -22): This is 2059 (continuing along the bottom edge of ring 23)
- (24, -21): Need to find what number is here

Wait, let me reconsider. Let me trace where 2027 is more carefully.

Actually, after placing 2025 at (22, -22), the spiral continues:
- 2026 at (23, -22) - right
- 2027 at (23, -21) - up
- continuing up along the right edge...

For the position (22, -21), this is in ring 22. In ring 22:
- The ring starts at 1922 (since ring 21 ends at 43² = 1849)
- Goes right along bottom from (-22, -22) to (22, -22)
- Then up along right edge from (22, -22) to (22, 22)
- Then left along top from (22, 22) to (-22, 22)
- Then down along left edge from (-22, 22) to (-22, -22)

Position (22, -21) is on the right edge, one step up from the corner. 
The corner (22, -22) has number 2025.
Going up from corner: the numbers decrease by 1 for each step.
So (22, -21) has number 2024.

Similarly:
- (22, -23) is outside ring 22, in ring 23, and has number 2058
- (23, -23) is the corner position, has 2026 + 23 = 2049 + 8 = 2057
- (24, -23) has 2057 - 1 = 2056
- (24, -22) has 2026 + 33 = 2059
- (24, -21) has 2059 + 1 = 2060

So the 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
2058, 2025, 2024, 2057, 2027, 2056, 2059, 2060

Sum = 2058 + 2025 + 2024 + 2057 + 2027 + 2056 + 2059 + 2060 = 16386
