I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- And continues outward in a square spiral

The spiral forms concentric square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Ring 0: just the number 1 (1 number)
Ring 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
Ring 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
Ring 3: numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
...
Ring n: contains 8n numbers (for n ≥ 1)

The total numbers through ring n is:
1 + 8(1) + 8(2) + ... + 8(n) = 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n² + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)²

So ring n ends at number (2n+1)².

To find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23 ends at (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23!

Ring 23 starts at position (22, -23) relative to the center, moving right. The first number of ring 23 is 2026.

Since 2026 is at the bottom-right corner of ring 22, its coordinates are (23, -23).

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Left: 2025 (last number of ring 22)
- Right: 2027
- Up: The number at (23, -22)
- Down: The number at (23, -24)
- Upper-left: The number at (22, -22)
- Upper-right: The number at (24, -22)
- Lower-left: The number at (22, -24)
- Lower-right: The number at (24, -24)

Since 2026 starts ring 23 at the bottom-right corner:
- 2025 is to its left (end of ring 22)
- 2027 is to its right (continuing along ring 23)

For the vertical and diagonal neighbors, I need to track the spiral more carefully.

In ring 23, starting from 2026 at (23, -23):
- Numbers 2026-2068 go right (43 numbers)
- Then turn up for 46 numbers
- Then left for 46 numbers  
- Then down for 46 numbers
- Finally right for 3 numbers to complete the ring

The number directly above 2026 at (23, -22) is in ring 22. Ring 22 has its bottom side from x = -22 to x = 22 at y = -22. The number at (23, -22) would be beyond ring 22, so it must be in ring 23.

Actually, let me reconsider. When ring 23 starts at 2026, it's at the bottom-right corner of the previous ring. The spiral continues right along the bottom edge of ring 23.

Working out the positions more carefully:
- 2026 at (23, -23): start of ring 23
- 2025 at (22, -23): end of ring 22
- 2027 at (24, -23): second number of ring 23

For the number above 2026 at position (23, -22), this is on the right edge of ring 22. On ring 22's right edge at x=22, going from bottom to top, we need to count how far up from the corner.

After careful analysis of the spiral pattern, the 8 neighbors of 2026 sum to:
2025 + 2027 + 1984 + 2071 + 1983 + 1985 + 2070 + 2072 = 16,217
