I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- And continues outward in this pattern

The spiral forms square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Ring 0: Just the number 1
Ring 1: Numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
Ring 2: Numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
Ring k: Contains 8k numbers

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So I need to find k such that (2k-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)²

Taking square roots: 2k-1 < √2026 ≤ 2k+1

√2026 ≈ 45.01, so 2k-1 < 45.01 ≤ 2k+1

This gives us k = 22. Let me verify:
- (2×22-1)² = 43² = 1849
- (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025

So 2026 is just outside ring 22, meaning it's the first number in ring 23.

In ring 23, the spiral starts at the bottom-right corner of the previous ring and moves right. Since 2025 = 45² is at the bottom-right corner of ring 22, number 2026 is one step to the right of 2025.

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is on the bottom edge of ring 23, moving right from 2025:

Position of 2025: It's at coordinates (22, -22) relative to center
Position of 2026: It's at coordinates (23, -22) relative to center

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are at positions:
- (22, -23): Below-left
- (23, -23): Below  
- (24, -23): Below-right
- (22, -22): Left (this is 2025)
- (24, -22): Right (this is 2027)
- (22, -21): Above-left
- (23, -21): Above
- (24, -21): Above-right

Now I need to find which numbers are at these positions:
- Left: 2025 (confirmed)
- Right: 2027 (next in spiral)
- Below: As we continue around ring 23 going right then up, the numbers below will be much later in the sequence

Actually, let me reconsider. On the bottom edge of ring 23:
- We start at 2026 (position 1 of ring 23)
- The ring has 8×23 = 184 numbers
- Going right along the bottom edge, we have 2026, 2027, ..., up to 2026 + 44 = 2070
- Then the spiral turns up along the right edge

The three positions below 2026 are in ring 24, which starts at 2026 + 184 = 2210.

Working out the positions more carefully:
- (22, -22): 2025
- (23, -22): 2026 
- (24, -22): 2027
- (22, -21): This is in ring 22, on the bottom edge, position 44 from start = 1850 + 43 = 1893
- (23, -21): This is in ring 23, but counted from the top... = 2026 + 184 - 46 = 2164
- (24, -21): This is in ring 24, which starts at 2210... this would be 2210 + 45 = 2255

Wait, I need to be more systematic about the three below positions:
- (22, -23): Ring 23, going up the left side: 2026 + 45 + 45 = 2116
- (23, -23): Ring 23, bottom edge moving backwards: 2026 + 184 - 1 = 2209
- (24, -23): Ring 23, going down the right side: 2026 + 45 = 2071

So the 8 neighbors are:
- 2025 (left)
- 2027 (right)  
- 1893 (above-left)
- 2164 (above)
- 2255 (above-right)
- 2116 (below-left)
- 2209 (below)
- 2071 (below-right)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1893 + 2164 + 2255 + 2116 + 2209 + 2071 = 16760
