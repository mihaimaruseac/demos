I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 moves right to (1, 0)
- 3 moves up to (1, 1)
- 4 moves left to (0, 1)
- 5 moves left to (-1, 1)
- 6 moves down to (-1, 0)
- 7 moves down to (-1, -1)
- 8 moves right to (0, -1)
- 9 moves right to (1, -1)

The spiral forms square layers. Let me identify the pattern:
- Layer 0: just the number 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: contains 8k numbers

The last number in layer k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So layer k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)².

To find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer 22: ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Layer 23: ends at (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

Since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, number 2026 is in layer 23.

2026 = 2025 + 1, so it's the first number after 2025.

At the end of layer 22, we're at position (22, -22) (bottom-right corner of layer 22).

Layer 23 starts by moving right from (22, -22) to (23, -22).

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -23): Need to find this number
- (22, -22): This is 2025 (end of layer 22)
- (22, -21): Need to find this number
- (23, -23): Need to find this number
- (23, -21): Need to find this number
- (24, -23): Need to find this number
- (24, -22): This is 2027 (next in the spiral)
- (24, -21): Need to find this number

For positions in layer 23:
- The right edge goes from (23, -22) up to (23, 22)
- Starting from 2026 at (23, -22), going up: 2026, 2027, 2028, ...
- So (23, -21) = 2028

Wait, let me reconsider. After 2025 at (22, -22), the spiral continues:
- 2026 at (23, -22) (move right)
- 2027 at (23, -21) (move up)
- continuing up along the right edge...

So:
- (23, -21) = 2027
- (24, -22) = 2026 + 8×23 = 2026 + 184 = 2210 (this will be on the next layer's bottom edge)

Actually, let me trace layer 22 ending and layer 23 beginning more carefully:
- Layer 22 ends at position (22, -22) with number 2025
- Layer 23 starts by moving right: 2026 at (23, -22)
- Then moves up the right edge: 2027 at (23, -21), 2028 at (23, -20), etc.

For the neighbors:
1. (22, -22) = 2025 ✓
2. (23, -21) = 2027 ✓
3. (22, -21) = on the bottom edge of layer 22, need to calculate
4. (22, -23) = outside layer 22, so in layer 23
5. (23, -23) = on layer 23
6. (24, -23) = on layer 24
7. (24, -22) = on layer 24  
8. (24, -21) = on layer 24

Layer 22 bottom edge: Goes from (22, -22) to (-22, -22)
The right corner (22, -22) has 2025. Moving left along bottom: 2024, 2023, ...
So (22, -21) = 2024

Layer 23: After going up the right edge, it goes along the top, then down the left, then along the bottom.
- Right edge: positions (23, y) for y from -22 to 22 (45 numbers)
- Top edge: positions (x, 23) for x from 22 to -23 (46 numbers)  
- Left edge: positions (-23, y) for y from 22 to -23 (46 numbers)
- Bottom edge: positions (x, -23) for x from -22 to 22 (45 numbers)

Position (22, -23) is on the bottom edge of layer 23.
Going around: 2026 + 45 + 46 + 46 gets us to (-22, -23), then we go right.
So (22, -23) = 2026 + 45 + 46 + 46 + 44 = 2026 + 181 = 2207

Position (23, -23) = 2207 + 1 = 2208

For layer 24 (starts at 2210):
- (24, -22) = 2210
- (24, -21) = 2211  
- (24, -23) = 2210 + 47 + 48 + 48 + 46 = 2210 + 189 = 2399

Sum of all neighbors: 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2207 + 2208 + 2399 + 2210 + 2211 = 16311
