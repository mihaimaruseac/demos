I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, numbers spiral outward:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is one step right
- 3 is one step up from 2
- 4 is one step left from 3
- 5 is one step left from 4
- 6 is one step down from 5
- 7 is one step down from 6
- 8 is one step right from 7
- 9 is one step right from 8

The spiral forms square rings. Let me identify the pattern:
- Ring 0: just the number 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 8n numbers (except ring 0)

The last number in ring n is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1) = (2n+1)²

So:
- Ring 0 ends at 1² = 1
- Ring 1 ends at 3² = 9
- Ring 2 ends at 5² = 25
- Ring 3 ends at 7² = 49
- Ring n ends at (2n+1)²

To find which ring contains 2026, I need to find n such that (2n-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2n+1)²

Let me check: √2026 ≈ 45.01

So I need (2n+1)² ≥ 2026, which means 2n+1 ≥ 45.01, so n ≥ 22.005

Checking: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
And (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

Since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, number 2026 is in ring 23.

Ring 23 starts at 2026 and ends at 2209. Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the first number of ring 23.

In each ring, numbers start at the bottom-right corner and spiral counter-clockwise. For ring 23:
- The ring extends from -23 to +23 in both x and y directions
- Starting position is at (23, -23)
- Numbers go left along the bottom edge first

Since 2026 is the first number of ring 23, it's at position (23, -23).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -23) are:
- (22, -24): This is in ring 23, on the bottom edge
- (22, -23): This is in ring 22, the last number of the right edge
- (22, -22): This is in ring 22, second-to-last on the right edge
- (23, -22): This is in ring 23, on the right edge
- (24, -22): This would be outside the spiral - not possible
- (24, -23): This would be outside the spiral - not possible  
- (24, -24): This would be outside the spiral - not possible
- (23, -24): This is in ring 23, on the bottom edge

Wait, let me reconsider. The spiral grows outward, so there are no positions beyond the current ring except where the spiral continues.

Position (23, -23) has these 8 neighbors:
- (22, -24), (22, -23), (22, -22): to the left
- (23, -24), (23, -22): above and below
- (24, -24), (24, -23), (24, -22): to the right

The positions to the right would be in ring 24, but ring 24 hasn't started yet at position 2026. So we need to figure out where the spiral continues.

Actually, let me reconsider the spiral direction. Looking at the original:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From 1: right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9.

So ring 23 starts at the bottom-right and goes LEFT first. The last number of ring 22 is 2025, which is at position (22, -22).

After 2025 at (22, -22), we need to go down and right to start ring 23, so 2026 is at (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23), (22, -22) = 2025, (22, -21)
- (23, -23), (23, -21)  
- (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21)

Working out which numbers these are:
- 2025 is at (22, -22)
- 2026 is at (23, -22)
- 2027 is at (23, -23) (going down from 2026)

Actually, I need to trace this more carefully. In ring 23, starting from position (23, -22):
- Goes down the right edge to (23, -23), then continue down to (23, 23)
- Then left along bottom edge
- Then up along left edge  
- Then right along top edge
- Finally ending just before the starting point

So:
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- 2027 at (23, -23)
- Continuing down the right edge...

The neighbors of 2026 at position (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23): in ring 22
- (22, -22): this is 2025
- (22, -21): in ring 22
- (23, -23): this is 2027  
- (23, -21): in ring 22
- (24, -23): will be filled later in ring 23
- (24, -22): will be filled later in ring 23
- (24, -21): will be filled later in ring 23

To find the exact values, I need to work out:
1. The numbers in ring 22 near position 2025
2. The numbers that will appear in ring 23 after going around

Ring 22 ends at 2025 = 45². Let me find positions near (22, -22):
- Ring 22 has 8×22 = 176 numbers (from 1850 to 2025)
- Position (22, -22) is the last number = 2025
- Position (22, -21) is 2024
- Position (23, -21) is in the corner, = 2023

For ring 22 near the bottom right:
- Goes right along bottom: (22, -22) is the end = 2025
- Before that (22, -21) = 2024  
- Before that (22, -20) = 2023
- Corner (23, -21) must be wrong...

Let me reconsider. Ring 22 goes:
- Starting from bottom-right corner, going left, up, right, down
- Ends at the starting position minus one

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me trace ring 22's end and ring 23's beginning:
- 2023 at (21, -22)
- 2024 at (22, -22) 
- 2025 at (22, -21)
- 2026 at (23, -21) [wrong, let me reconsider the whole spiral]

Actually, I should verify with smaller rings. For ring 1:
- 2 at (1, 0)
- 3 at (1, 1)  
- 4 at (0, 1)
- 5 at (-1, 1)
- 6 at (-1, 0)
- 7 at (-1, -1)
- 8 at (0, -1)
- 9 at (1, -1)

Ring 2 starts at (2, -1):
- 10 at (2, -1)

So each ring starts one position right of the previous ring's end.

For ring 22 ending at 2025 and ring 23 starting at 2026:
- If 2025 is the last of ring 22, it's at (22, -21)
- Then 2026 starts ring 23 at (23, -21)

But let me verify by working backwards from what we know:
- Ring 23 contains 8×23 = 184 numbers
- Ring 23 goes from 2026 to 2209
- 2026 is at the starting position of ring 23

From the pattern, ring n starts at position (n, -(n-1)).

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

Now I'll trace where nearby numbers are:
- 2025 (last of ring 22) is at (22, -22)
- 2024 is at (22, -23) 
- 2027 is at (23, -23)
- 2028 is at (23, -24)

Hmm, this doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider once more.

Looking at the pattern with centered coordinates where 1 is at (0, 0):
- 2 at (1, 0), 3 at (1, 1), 4 at (0, 1), 5 at (-1, 1)
- 6 at (-1, 0), 7 at (-1, -1), 8 at (0, -1), 9 at (1, -1)
- 10 at (2, -1)

So ring n starts at (n, -(n-1)) and first moves down.

For ring 23: starts at (23, -22), first number is 2026
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- 2027 at (23, -23)

For the end of ring 22 (ending at 2025):
- Goes right along top edge, then down right edge
- 2025 at (22, -22)
- 2024 at (22, -21)
- 2023 at (22, -20)

Now I can find the 8 neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22):

1. (22, -23): Need to find what's in ring 22 at this position
2. (22, -22): This is 2025
3. (22, -21): This is 2024  
4. (23, -23): This is 2027
5. (23, -21): Need to find what's in ring 22 at this position
6. (24, -23): Need to find what's in ring 23 at this position
7. (24, -22): Need to find what's in ring 23 at this position
8. (24, -21): Need to find what's in ring 22 at this position

For positions in ring 22:
- The right edge of ring 22 goes from (22, 22) down to (22, -22)
- That's 45 positions, and 2025 is at the bottom
- So position (22, -23) doesn't exist (it's outside ring 22)

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself with coordinates. Let me restart with a clearer approach.

The spiral follows this pattern: R, U, L, L, D, D, R, R, R, U, U, U, ...
- 1 step right, 1 up, 2 left, 2 down, 3 right, 3 up, 4 left, 4 down, ...

Starting from 1 at origin (0, 0):
- After 1: at (1, 0)
- After 3: at (1, 1) 
- After 5: at (-1, 1)
- After 7: at (-1, -1)
- After 9: at (2, -1)

The position after n² is approximately at (n/2, -n/2) for even n.

Since 2025 = 45², after 2025 we're near position (22.5, -22.5), more precisely at (23, -22).

After 2025: We've just completed a rightward segment. Next is upward.
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- 2027 at (23, -21)
- Going up 45 steps...
- Then left 46 steps...
- Then down 46 steps...

So from 2026 at (23, -22), the neighbors are:
- Up: 2027 at (23, -21)
- Down: We need to go around the spiral to get here
- Left: 2025 at (22, -22)
- Right: We need to go around the spiral to get here

Let me work out the path:
- 2026-2070: going up from (23, -22) to (23, 23) [45 positions]
- 2071-2116: going left from (23, 23) to (-23, 23) [46 positions]
- 2117-2162: going down from (-23, 23) to (-23, -23) [46 positions]  
- 2163-2209: going right from (-23, -23) to (23, -23) [47 positions]

So position (23, -23) is 2209.

Now finding all neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22):
- (22, -23): In ring 22, going right along bottom edge. 
- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -21): In ring 22, going up along right edge. This is 2024
- (23, -23): This is 2209
- (23, -21): This is 2027
- (24, -23): In ring 24, will be 2210
- (24, -22): In ring 24, will be 2210 + 47 = 2257  
- (24, -21): In ring 24, will be 2257 + 1 = 2258

Wait, I think I'm making errors. Let me carefully work out what's at (22, -23).

Ring 22 path:
- Starts at (22, -21)
- Goes down to (22, -22): This puts 1851 at start, 1852 at (22, -22)
- But that's wrong since 2025 is at (22, -22)

I need to trace ring 22 more carefully. Ring 22 has 176 numbers from 1850 to 2025.
- Starts at (22, -21): 1850
- Down 43 steps to (22, -22): 1850, 1851, ..., 1893
- No wait, that's wrong.

Let me think differently. The last number 2025 of ring 22 is one position before where 2026 starts.

If 2026 is at (23, -22), and numbers spiral counter-clockwise, then 2025 must be at (22, -22).

Working backwards in ring 22:
- 2025 at (22, -22)
- 2024 at (22, -21)
- 2023 at (22, -20)
- ...
- Ring 22 goes up the right side

Also, after completing ring 23, we have:
- 2209 at (23, -23)
- 2210 starts ring 24 at (24, -23)

Now I need (22, -23). In ring 22, the bottom edge goes from right to left:
- Starts at (22, -22) going left
- But wait, that's where 2025 is, at the END of ring 22

I think I need to be more systematic. In ring 22:
- Has 176 numbers
- Goes: down 43, left 44, up 44, right 45
- Ends just before where it started

If it ends at (22, -22) with 2025, it must have started at (22, -21) with 1850.
- Down from (22, -21) to (22, -22): 1850
- Down from (22, -22) to (22, 22): 1851 to 1893 (43 numbers)
- Left from (22, 22) to (-22, 22): 1894 to 1937 (44 numbers)  
- Up from (-22, 22) to (-22, -22): 1938 to 1981 (44 numbers)
- Right from (-22, -22) to (22, -22): 1982 to 2025 (44 numbers)

So at (22, -23) there's nothing (outside ring 22).

Similarly:
- (23, -21) is where ring 22 started, so nothing there from ring 22
- (24, -21) is outside ring 23

Working out ring 22 positions near the end:
- (21, -22): 2024
- (22, -22): 2025

And ring 24 positions:
- Starts at (24, -23): 2210
- Down to (24, -24): 2211
- ...
- After going down 47, left 48, up 48, we get to (24, -23): 2210
- Then right to (24, -22): 2210 + 47 + 48 + 48 = 2353
- Then right to (24, -21): 2354

Let me recalculate the neighbors of 2026:

2026 is at (23, -22). Its 8 neighbors are:

1. (22, -23): Outside ring 22, inside ring 23. From 2026, we go up 45 to (23, 23), left 46 to (-23, 23), down 46 to (-23, -23), right 45 to (22, -23). That's 2026 + 45 + 46 + 46 + 45 = 2208.

2. (22, -22): This is 2025

3. (22, -21): This is 2024

4. (23, -23): This is 2209

5. (23, -21): This is 2027  

6. (24, -23): This is 2210

7. (24, -22): From 2210, we need to trace ring 24. Ring 24 goes down 47, left 48, up 48, right 49. So right 46 from (24, -23) gives (24, -22) = 2210 + 47 + 48 + 48 + 46 = 2399.

Actually let me recompute. 2210 is at (24, -23). Ring 24 spirals:
- Down 47 to (24, 24)
- Left 48 to (-24, 24)  
- Up 48 to (-24, -24)
- Right 49 to end

So (24, -22) comes after going down, left, up, and right 46 steps = 2210 + 47 + 48 + 48 + 46 = 2399.

8. (24, -21): This is 2400.

But wait, I made an error with (22, -23). This position is in ring 23, not 22. 

In ring 23, from 2026 we go:
- Up 45 to position (23, 23): numbers 2027 to 2071  
- Left 46 to position (-23, 23): numbers 2072 to 2117
- Down 46 to position (-23, -23): numbers 2118 to 2163
- Right 46 to position (23, -23): numbers 2164 to 2209

To get to (22, -23) we need right 45 from (-23, -23): 2163 + 45 = 2208.

So the 8 neighbors are:
1. (22, -23) = 2208
2. (22, -22) = 2025  
3. (22, -21) = 2024
4. (23, -23) = 2209
5. (23, -21) = 2027
6. (24, -23) = 2210
7. (24, -22) = 2399
8. (24, -21) = 2400

Sum = 2208 + 2025 + 2024 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2399 + 2400 = 16502
