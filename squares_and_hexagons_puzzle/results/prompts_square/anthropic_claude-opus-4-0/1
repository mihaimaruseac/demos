I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral pattern and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1, the spiral moves:
- Right: 1 → 2
- Up: 2 → 3
- Left: 3 → 4 → 5
- Down: 5 → 6 → 7
- Right: 7 → 8 → 9
- And continues outward...

The spiral forms square rings. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers) 
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring k: has 8k numbers

Total numbers up to and including ring k: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So I need to find k where (2k+1)² ≥ 2026.

√2026 ≈ 45.01, so 2k+1 ≈ 45, giving k = 22.

Let me verify:
- Up to ring 21: (2×21+1)² = 43² = 1849
- Up to ring 22: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23!

Ring 23 starts at position 2026. The spiral enters ring 23 from the bottom-right of ring 22, moving right.

In any ring k, the pattern is:
- Start by moving right from position (k-1, -k)
- Move 2k steps right
- Move 2k steps up  
- Move 2k+1 steps left
- Move 2k+1 steps down
- Move 1 step right to complete

Since 2026 is the first number of ring 23, it's at position (22, -23) in coordinates where 1 is at (0,0).

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Left: 2025 (last number of ring 22)
- Right: 2027 (next in ring 23)
- The 6 others are in different rings

For a number at the start of a ring (moving right), its neighbors are:
- Left: previous number (2025)
- Right: next number (2027)
- Up-left, Up, Up-right: three consecutive numbers from earlier in the previous ring
- Down-left, Down, Down-right: three consecutive numbers from later in the spiral

Looking at the spiral structure, when at position (22, -23):
- The three numbers above are at y = -22 in ring 22
- The three numbers below are at y = -24 

In ring 22, at y = -22 (bottom edge), we're near the end of the ring. Ring 22 has 8×22 = 176 numbers, starting at 1850 and ending at 2025.

The bottom edge of ring 22 runs from x = 22 to x = -22. Position (22, -22) is the bottom-right corner.

Working backwards from 2025:
- 2025 is at (21, -22)
- 2024 is at (20, -22)  
- 2023 is at (19, -22)

So the three neighbors above 2026 are at positions (21, -22), (22, -22), (23, -22), but (23, -22) would be outside ring 22...

Actually, let me reconsider. At the start of ring 23, position (22, -23):
- The number at (22, -22) is at the corner of ring 22
- Going around ring 22 to find what's at positions (21, -22), (22, -22), (23, -22)...

Ring 22 ends at 2025. At the bottom-right corner (22, -22), we have 2025 - 21 = 2004.
- (21, -22): 2003
- (22, -22): 2004  
- (23, -22): This would be 2005 but that's impossible...

Let me recalculate. I think I made an error. Let me trace ring 22 more carefully.

Ring 22 starts at 1850 at position (21, -22) and moves right. After moving right 44 steps, it reaches (65, -22)... No, that's wrong.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let me use the fact that 2026 starts ring 23, and 2025 ends ring 22.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (to the right)  
- Three numbers from the bottom edge of ring 22 (above)
- Three numbers that will appear later in ring 23 (below)

Since ring 22 has 176 numbers (1850-2025), and 2025 is the last one, working backwards:
- 2025, 2024, 2023... are the last few numbers going left along the bottom edge
- Then the spiral turns up at the bottom-left corner

The numbers directly above 2026 would be 2003, 2004, 2005 (three consecutive numbers from near the end of ring 22's bottom edge).

The numbers below will be much later in ring 23. Ring 23 will go right for 46 steps, up for 46 steps, left for 47 steps, then down. The numbers below 2026 will be from the downward portion, which starts at 2026 + 46 + 46 + 47 = 2165.

So the numbers below are around 2165, 2166, 2167.

The sum of all 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2165 + 2166 + 2167 = 16162
