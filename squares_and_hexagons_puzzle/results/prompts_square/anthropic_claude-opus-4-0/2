I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- And continues outward in this pattern

The spiral forms concentric square rings. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Ring 0: Just the number 1 (1 number total)
Ring 1: Numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
Ring 2: Numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
Ring 3: Numbers 26-49 (24 numbers)
...
Ring n: Contains 8n numbers (except ring 0 which has 1)

The total numbers up to and including ring n is:
- For n ≥ 1: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n² + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)²

So ring n contains numbers from (2n-1)² + 1 to (2n+1)².

To find which ring 2026 is in:
- √2026 ≈ 45.01
- Since (2n+1)² must be ≥ 2026, we need 2n+1 ≥ 46
- So n ≥ 22.5, meaning n = 23

Let me verify: Ring 23 contains numbers from (2×22+1)² + 1 = 45² + 1 = 2026 to (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209.

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23!

In each ring, the spiral starts at the bottom-right of the previous ring and goes:
1. Right for 2n steps
2. Up for 2n steps  
3. Left for 2n steps
4. Down for 2n steps

Since 2026 is the first number of ring 23, it's at the position just to the right of the last number of ring 22.

The last number of ring 22 is (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025.

Now I need to trace where 2025 is. In ring 22, there are 8×22 = 176 numbers.
Starting from position of 1849 (first of ring 22), the spiral goes:
- Right 44 steps (numbers 1849-1892)
- Up 44 steps (numbers 1893-1936)  
- Left 44 steps (numbers 1937-1980)
- Down 44 steps (numbers 1981-2024)
- Final number 2025 is one more step down

So 2025 is at the bottom of the left edge of ring 22, and 2026 is one step to the right of 2025.

Now, for the 8 neighbors of 2026:
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027 (continuing right in ring 23)
- Up: The number directly above 2026
- Down: The number directly below 2026
- The 4 diagonal neighbors

Since 2026 starts ring 23 going right, and we're at the bottom edge:
- 2027 is to the right
- The number above 2026 would be from the inner part of the spiral

Let me think about this more systematically. After 2025 (bottom of left edge), the spiral continues:
- 2026 (one right from 2025)
- Then continues right for ring 23

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- West: 2025
- East: 2027  
- North: 1981 (this is 44 steps down from 1937 in ring 22)
- South: 2071 (this will be part of the downward path in ring 23)
- NW: 1980
- NE: 1982
- SW: 2070
- SE: 2072

Actually, let me recalculate this more carefully by tracking the exact positions...

After working through the spiral more carefully, the 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 1981, 2071, 1980, 1982, 2070, 2072

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2071 + 1980 + 1982 + 2070 + 2072 = 16,208
