Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand how the numbers are arranged on the spiral and then determine the neighbors of the number 2026 to find their sum.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize the spiral based on the given snippet:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the spiral starts at the center with the number 1, and then it spirals outward in a counterclockwise direction. Here's how the numbers are arranged:

- The center is 1.
- The numbers increase as we move outward in layers or rings around the center.

To better understand, let's expand the spiral to see more numbers:

```
... 21 22 23 24 25 ...
... 20  7  8  9 10 ...
... 19  6  1  2 11 ...
... 18  5  4  3 12 ...
... 17 16 15 14 13 ...
```

From this, we can observe that the spiral is constructed by adding layers around the center. Each layer forms a square ring around the previous one.

### Identifying the Layer Structure

Let's identify how the numbers are placed in each layer:

1. **Layer 0 (Center):** Just the number 1.
2. **Layer 1:** Numbers from 2 to 8 (forming a 3x3 square around the center).
   - Top: 2, 3, 4
   - Right: 5
   - Bottom: 6, 7, 8
   - Left: (not visible in the initial snippet, but would be part of the full layer)
3. **Layer 2:** Numbers from 9 to 24 (forming a 5x5 square).
   - Top: 9, 10, 11, 12
   - Right: 13
   - Bottom: 14, 15, 16, 17
   - Left: 18, 19, 20, 21
4. And so on...

Each layer `n` (starting from 1) contains numbers from `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`.

### Finding the Layer of a Number

To find out which layer a number `k` is in, we can determine the smallest `n` such that `(2n+1)^2 >= k`.

For example:
- For `k = 2026`:
  - `(2n+1)^2 >= 2026`
  - `2n+1 >= sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01`
  - `2n+1 >= 46`
  - `n >= (46 - 1)/2 = 22.5`
  - So, `n = 23` (since `n` must be an integer)

Now, let's verify:
- For `n=22`:
  - `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
  - So, layer 22 contains numbers from `2025 + 1 = 2026` to `45^2 = 2025` (but wait, this seems off because `2026` is just after `2025`, which is the last number of layer 22).

Wait, let's clarify the layer numbering and the range of numbers in each layer.

Actually, the layers are defined as follows:
- Layer 0: 1
- Layer 1: 2 to 8 (numbers from `(2*1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` to `(2*1 + 1)^2 = 9`, but since layer 0 is just 1, layer 1 is from 2 to 8)
- Layer 2: 9 to 24
- Layer 3: 25 to 48
- ...
- Layer n: from `(2n-1)^2 + 1` to `(2n+1)^2`

So, for `n=22`:
- `(2*22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`
- `(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
So, layer 22 is from 1850 to 2025.

Then, layer 23:
- `(2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026`
- `(2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209`
So, layer 23 is from 2026 to 2209.

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Position of 2026 in the Spiral

Now, let's determine the position of 2026 in the spiral.

Each layer `n` starts at the top-right corner of that layer and goes counterclockwise.

For layer `n`, the starting number is `(2n-1)^2 + 1`, and it's placed at the top-right corner of the layer.

For `n=23`:
- Starting number: 2026
- Position: top-right corner of layer 23.

In a grid, if we consider the center (1) at (0,0), then the layers are squares centered at (0,0).

The top-right corner of layer `n` is at `(n, -n)`.

So, 2026 is at position `(23, -23)`.

### Determining the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of a number in a grid are the adjacent cells in all 8 possible directions: up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonals.

Given that 2026 is at `(23, -23)`, its neighbors are at:

1. `(23, -23 + 1) = (23, -22)` (right)
2. `(23, -23 - 1) = (23, -24)` (left)
3. `(23 + 1, -23) = (24, -23)` (down)
4. `(23 - 1, -23) = (22, -23)` (up)
5. `(23 + 1, -23 + 1) = (24, -22)` (down-right)
6. `(23 + 1, -23 - 1) = (24, -24)` (down-left)
7. `(23 - 1, -23 + 1) = (22, -22)` (up-right)
8. `(23 - 1, -23 - 1) = (22, -24)` (up-left)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions in the spiral.

### Finding Numbers at Neighboring Positions

The spiral is constructed such that each layer `n` is a square ring with side length `2n + 1` (from `-n` to `n` in both x and y directions).

The numbers are placed starting from the top-right corner of the layer and go counterclockwise.

For layer `n`, the numbers are placed as follows:
- Start at `(n, -n)` (top-right), value `(2n-1)^2 + 1`
- Move left to `(n-1, -n)`, value `(2n-1)^2 + 2`
- Continue left to `(-(n-1), -n)`, value `(2n-1)^2 + 2n`
- Move down to `-(n), -(n-1)`, value `(2n-1)^2 + 2n + 1`
- Continue down to `-(n), n-1`, value `(2n-1)^2 + 4n - 1`
- Move right to `n-1, n`, value `(2n-1)^2 + 4n`
- Continue right to `n, n`, value `(2n+1)^2`

Given that, let's find the numbers at the neighboring positions of `(23, -23)` (which is the top-right corner of layer 23).

1. `(23, -22)` (right):
   - This is the second position in the top row of layer 23.
   - The top row goes from `(23, -23)` to `(-22, -23)`.
   - `(23, -23)` is the first number: 2026
   - `(23, -22)` is the second number: 2026 + 1 = 2027
   - Wait, no. Actually, the numbers increase as we move left from the top-right corner.
   - So, `(23, -23)` is 2026, `(22, -23)` is 2027, ..., `(-22, -23)` is 2026 + 23*2 = 2026 + 46 = 2072.
   - So, `(23, -22)` is not in the top row; the top row is all x from 23 down to -22 at y=-23.
   - `(23, -22)` is directly to the right of `(23, -23)`, which is not in the same layer. It's in the next layer (layer 24).
   - Wait, no. The layers are squares, so `(23, -22)` is in the same layer as `(23, -23)` because both have y=-23, and x ranges from -23 to 23 in layer 23.
   - So, `(23, -22)` is the second number in the top row, which is 2026 + 1 = 2027.

2. `(23, -24)` (left):
   - This is to the left of `(23, -23)`, which is not in the same layer. It's in layer 24.
   - The left neighbor of `(23, -23)` is `(22, -23)`, which is 2027.
   - `(23, -24)` is not a neighbor in the grid sense because it's not adjacent in the spiral's grid. The immediate left neighbor is `(22, -23)`.

Hmm, this seems confusing. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the 8 neighbors are the cells immediately adjacent in the grid, regardless of the spiral's layer structure.

Given that, let's find the numbers at those positions by determining their layer and position within that layer.

But since 2026 is at the top-right corner of layer 23, its neighbors are:

- Right: `(23, -22)` - this is in the same layer, next in the top row: 2027
- Left: `(22, -23)` - previous in the top row: 2027 (but no, `(23, -23)` is 2026, `(22, -23)` is 2027, `(21, -23)` is 2028, etc.)
Wait, no, `(23, -23)` is the first in the top row, so `(22, -23)` is the second: 2027.

But `(23, -24)` is not in the same layer; it's in layer 24.

Similarly, `(24, -23)` is in layer 24.

This suggests that some neighbors are in the next layer (layer 24), which starts at `(24, -24)` with number `(2*24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210`.

The top row of layer 24 goes from `(24, -24)` to `(-23, -24)`:
- `(24, -24)`: 2210
- `(23, -24)`: 2211
- ...
- `(-23, -24)`: 2210 + 24 = 2234

Similarly, the right column goes from `(24, -23)` to `(24, 23)`:
- `(24, -23)`: 2235
- `(24, -22)`: 2236
- ...
- `(24, 23)`: 2235 + 24 = 2259

Now, let's find the numbers at the 8 neighbors of `(23, -23)` (2026):

1. `(23, -22)`: in layer 23, top row, second position: 2027
2. `(23, -24)`: in layer 24, top row, second position: 2211
3. `(24, -23)`: in layer 24, right column, first position: 2235
4. `(22, -23)`: in layer 23, top row, second position: 2027 (but this is the same as `(23, -22)`? Wait, no, `(23, -23)` is 2026, `(22, -23)` is 2027, `(21, -23)` is 2028, etc.)
Wait, no, `(23, -23)` is the first in the top row, so `(22, -23)` is the second: 2027.

But `(23, -22)` is not in the top row; the top row is all y=-23, x from 23 to -22. So `(23, -22)` is not in the top row; it's to the right of `(23, -23)`, which is not in the same layer's top row.

This is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the 8 neighbors are the cells immediately adjacent in the grid, and their numbers can be determined by their positions relative to 2026.

Given that 2026 is at `(23, -23)`, and the spiral is constructed by adding layers outward, the neighbors are:

- Right: `(23, -22)` - this is in the same layer, next in the top row: 2027
- Left: `(22, -23)` - previous in the top row: 2027
- Down: `(24, -23)` - in layer 24, right column, first: 2235
- Up: `(22, -23)` - same as left
- Down-right: `(24, -22)` - in layer 24, right column, second: 2236
- Down-left: `(24, -24)` - in layer 24, top row, first: 2210
- Up-right: `(22, -22)` - in layer 23, top row, third: 2028
- Up-left: `(22, -24)` - in layer 24, top row, third: 2212

Now, let's list the neighbors and their numbers:

1. `(23, -22)`: 2027
2. `(23, -24)`: 2211
3. `(24, -23)`: 2235
4. `(22, -23)`: 2027
5. `(24, -22)`: 2236
6. `(24, -24)`: 2210
7. `(22, -22)`: 2028
8. `(22, -24)`: 2212

Now, let's sum these numbers:

2027 (right)
+ 2211 (left-down)
+ 2235 (down)
+ 2027 (left)
+ 2236 (down-right)
+ 2210 (left-down)
+ 2028 (up-right)
+ 2212 (up-left)
= ?

Let's add them step by step:

2027 + 2211 = 4238
4238 + 2235 = 6473
6473 + 2027 = 8500
8500 + 2236 = 10736
10736 + 2210 = 12946
12946 + 2028 = 14974
14974 + 2212 = 17186

So, the sum is 17186.

However, let's double-check the assignments to ensure no mistakes were made in identifying the numbers at each position.

### Verifying Neighbor Assignments

1. `(23, -22)`: Right neighbor of `(23, -23)`. In the same layer (layer 23), the top row is from `(23, -23)` to `(-22, -23)`, so `(23, -22)` is the next in the top row: 2027.
2. `(23, -24)`: Left of `(23, -23)`. This is not in the same layer; it's in layer 24, top row, second position: 2211.
3. `(24, -23)`: Down from `(23, -23)`. In layer 24, right column, first position: 2235.
4. `(22, -23)`: Up from `(23, -23)`. In layer 23, top row, second position: 2027.
5. `(24, -22)`: Down-right from `(23, -23)`. In layer 24, right column, second position: 2236.
6. `(24, -24)`: Down-left from `(23, -23)`. In layer 24, top row, first position: 2210.
7. `(22, -22)`: Up-right from `(23, -23)`. In layer 23, top row, third position: 2028.
8. `(22, -24)`: Up-left from `(23, -23)`. In layer 24, top row, third position: 2212.

The assignments seem correct. Adding them up again:

2027
+2211 = 4238
+2235 = 6473
+2027 = 8500
+2236 = 10736
+2210 = 12946
+2028 = 14974
+2212 = 17186

The sum is indeed 17186.

### Final Answer

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **17186**.
