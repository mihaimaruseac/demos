The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It's shown as:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out. It starts with 1 at the center, then 2 to the right, 3 up, 4 left, 5 left, but looking at the grid:

It seems like from 1, it goes right to 2, then up to 3? But in the first row, it's 5,4,3, so probably 3 is above 2? Let me sketch this out.

Assume the center is 1. Then moving right: 2. Then, since it's a spiral, probably next is up to 3, but in the grid, above 2 is 3, and left of 3 is 4, left of 4 is 5, then down to 6? Below 1 is 7? The grid shows:

Row 1: ... 5 4 3 ... so positions: say column x, y. Set coordinates.

Set the center (0,0) as 1. Then, moving right to (1,0) is 2. Then, moving up to (1,1) is 3. Then left to (0,1) is 4. Then left to (-1,1) is 5. Then down to (-1,0) is 6. Then down to (-1,-1) is 7. Then right to (0,-1) is 8. Then right to (1,-1) is 9. Then up to (1,0) but that's already occupied by 2, so probably next is up to (2,1) or something.

After 7 at (-1,-1), then to (0,-1) is 8, then to (1,-1) is 9, then since right is blocked or direction changes, probably up to (1,0) but occupied, so must go up to (1,1) but that's 3, occupied. I think I messed up.

Standard Ulam spiral or something. Typically, it starts at center, moves right, then up, but after 2, it should go to the next direction. Let me list the sequence.

Start at (0,0): 1.

Move right to (1,0): 2.

Move up to (1,1): 3.

Move left to (0,1): 4.

Move left to (-1,1): 5.

Now, move down to (-1,0): 6.

Move down to (-1,-1): 7.

Move right to (0,-1): 8.

Move right to (1,-1): 9.

Now, move up to (1,0): but that's already 2, occupied. So instead, after 9 at (1,-1), it should move up, but (1,0) is taken, so it must change direction. Typically, in spirals, after completing a layer, it moves to the next.

After 9, it should go to (2,-1) or something. Let's see the grid given: it shows 5,4,3 in first row, which might be y=1, and 6,1,2 at y=0, and 7,8,9 at y=-1. But it has dots, so it extends.

In the grid, it shows:

... 5 4 3 ... so probably x decreasing, y constant? Assume y increases up, x increases right.

So at (x,y):

For y=1: ... x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But 3 is at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1).

Then y=0: ... x=-1:6? But 6 is below 5? In the grid it's "6 1 2", so probably x=-1,y=0:6, x=0,y=0:1, x=1,y=0:2.

Then y=-1: "7 8 9" so x=-1,y=-1:7, x=0,y=-1:8, x=1,y=-1:9.

But what about above? It shows dots, so probably at y=2, there are more numbers. After 5 at (-1,1), it should continue. After 5, it went down to (-1,0):6, then down to (-1,-1):7, then right to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9, then since it can't go up, it should go right to (2,-1):10, then up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, and so on.

But in the grid, it shows only up to 9, but for neighbors of 2026, I need the pattern.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are placed in a counter-clockwise spiral, starting from center moving right.

To find the position of a given number, I need a formula or a way to locate where 2026 is.

I know that the spiral is divided into layers or rings. Each "ring" around the center has a certain size.

The center 1 is ring 0.

Then ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, which is 8 numbers.

Ring 2: 10 to 25? Let's see: after 9 at (1,-1), move right to (2,-1):10, up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13? But then left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17, then down to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21, then right to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25. Yes, so ring 2 is from 10 to 25, which is 16 numbers.

Ring 3 would be from 26 to 49? 26 at (3,-2) or something, but anyway, each ring k has 8k numbers? Ring 0: 1 number. Ring 1: 8 numbers (2-9). Ring 2: 16 numbers (10-25). Ring 3: should be 24 numbers? 8*3=24, but 26 to 26+23=49? 49 is 7^2, and 1 is 1^2, 9 is 3^2, 25 is 5^2, so the squares are at the bottom right? In ring k, the last number is (2k+1)^2.

For k=0: (1)^2=1.

k=1: (3)^2=9.

k=2: (5)^2=25.

k=3: (7)^2=49.

And the first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=1: (1)^2 +1=2.

k=2: (3)^2 +1=10.

k=3: (5)^2 +1=26.

Yes.

The side length of ring k is 2k+1, but the ring itself has numbers from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

The number of numbers in ring k is (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = [4k^2 + 4k +1] - [4k^2 -4k +1] = 8k.

Yes, so 8k numbers in ring k.

Now, I need to find in which ring 2026 is.

So, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Set m = 2k+1, so m is odd, and m^2 >= 2026, and (m-2)^2 < 2026.

Since m is odd, compute sqrt(2026).

sqrt(2025)=45, since 45^2=2025.

2025 is 45^2, which is odd, so m=45.

But m=2k+1, so 2k+1=45, k=22.

Now, (2k-1)^2 = (44-1)? k=22, 2k-1=44-1=43? 2*22-1=44-1=43, yes.

(43)^2=1849.

(45)^2=2025.

So ring k=22 starts at (43)^2 +1 = 1849 +1=1850, and ends at 2025.

But 2026 is greater than 2025, so it should be in the next ring.

2025 is the last number of ring k=22, since (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

So 2026 is the first number of ring k=23.

Ring k=23 starts at (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

And ends at (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

So yes, 2026 is the first number of ring 23.

Now, each ring has a starting point and a direction.

In ring k, it starts at a certain position and moves in a certain direction.

Typically, for ring k, it starts at the position just to the right of the end of the previous ring.

The end of ring k-1 is at (k-1, -(k-1)) or something? Let's see the pattern.

For ring k, the starting point is at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

Recall for small k.

Ring 0: k=0, only (0,0):1.

Ring 1: k=1, starts at (1,0):2? But earlier we had (1,0):2, but ring 1 goes to (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So starts at (1,0).

Ring 2: starts at (2,-1):10? Earlier we said (2,-1):10.

Then goes up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13? Then left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17, then down to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21, then right to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25.

So starts at (2,-1).

Ring 3: should start at (3,-2):26, then up to (3,-1):27, (3,0):28, (3,1):29, (3,2):30, (3,3):31? Then left to (2,3):32, etc.

Pattern: for ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)).

For k=1: (1, -(0)) = (1,0), yes.

k=2: (2,-1), yes.

k=3: (3,-2), yes.

And it moves in the direction: up, then left, then down, then right? Let's see.

For ring k=1: starts at (1,0), moves up to (1,1), then left to (0,1), (-1,1), then down to (-1,0), (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1), (1,-1).

So directions: up, left, down, right.

Each direction for k steps? Up: from (1,0) to (1,1), so one step up? But k=1, so each direction has k steps? Up: one step to (1,1). Then left: two steps? To (0,1), then (-1,1), so two steps? But k=1, should be k steps? One step per direction? But from start to end: from (1,0) to (1,1) is one up, then to (-1,1) is two left? Inconsistency.

Actually, in each direction, it moves k steps, but the first direction has k steps? For ring k, each side has k steps? But total moves are 8k, but each "side" should have a certain number.

For ring k, it moves:

- right? No, starts by moving up? In k=1: moves up 1 step (to (1,1)), then left 2 steps? To (0,1), then (-1,1), but that's two steps, but only to (-1,1), then down 2 steps to (-1,0), (-1,-1), then right 2 steps to (0,-1), (1,-1). But total moves: up 1, left 2, down 2, right 2? But 1+2+2+2=7 moves, but 8 numbers? The start is included, but moves are between numbers.

The sequence: number 2 at (1,0), then move to 3 at (1,1): one step up. Then to 4 at (0,1): left, then to 5 at (-1,1): left again, so two left steps. Then to 6 at (-1,0): down, to 7 at (-1,-1): down again, so two down. Then to 8 at (0,-1): right, to 9 at (1,-1): right again, so two right. But only 7 moves? Numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: eight numbers, but moves: from 2 to 3,3 to4,4 to5,5 to6,6 to7,7 to8,8 to9: seven moves. The positions: each number occupies a cell, and we move to adjacent cells.

In terms of direction changes: for ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)), and moves in four directions: up, left, down, right, each for a certain distance.

For k=1: starts at (1,0). Moves up: but to (1,1), so delta y=+1, so one step up. Then moves left: to (0,1), then to (-1,1), so delta x=-1 twice? From (1,1) to (-1,1) is two steps left? But after moving up to (1,1), it moves left to (0,1) and then to (-1,1), so two steps left. Then down to (-1,0), (-1,-1): two steps down. Then right to (0,-1), (1,-1): two steps right. But the last step to (1,-1) is the end.

Total steps: up:1, left:2, down:2, right:2. But 1+2+2+2=7 steps, but there are 8 positions? The start position is fixed, and we move to new positions.

The number of moves in each direction: for ring k, the first direction (up) has k steps? Here k=1, up has 1 step (from (1,0) to (1,1)), but that's one move, covering two positions? When we move, each move covers one step to a new cell.

From start cell, we move to the next cell in the direction.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)), and moves:

- Up: k steps? For k=1, up 1 step: from (1,0) to (1,1). So now at (1,1).

Then moves left: how many steps? To (-1,1), which is two steps: to (0,1), then to (-1,1). So 2 steps.

But k=1, not consistent.

I recall that for ring k, the side length is k+1 or something. Note that the maximum coordinate in ring k is k.

For example, ring k=1: max |x| or |y| is 1, since |x|<=1, |y|<=1.

k=2: |x|<=2, |y|<=2.

k=3: |x|<=3, |y|<=3.

And the starting point is (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k).

Now, the movement: for ring k, it moves:

- Up: for k steps? But in k=1, it moved up only one step, but k=1.

Actually, for ring k, it moves:

- Up: k steps? Let's see the displacement.

From start (k, 1-k), after moving up, it should be at (k, 1-k + k) = (k,1)? For k=1: (1,0) to (1,1), yes y=1.

Then moves left: how many? To x= -k? For k=1, to x=-1, so from x=1 to x=-1, delta x= -2, so 2 steps? But k=1, 2 is not k.

Notice that from (k,1) it moves left to (-k,1)? For k=1: from (1,1) to (-1,1), delta x=-2, so 2 steps.

Then from (-k,1) moves down to (-k,-k+1)? For k=1: from (-1,1) to (-1,-1)? But in sequence, it went to (-1,0) then (-1,-1), so to y=-1, which is -k since k=1.

But from y=1 to y=-1, delta y=-2, so 2 steps down.

Then from (-k,-k) moves right to (k,-k)? For k=1: from (-1,-1) to (1,-1)? But it went to (0,-1) then (1,-1), so to x=1, delta x=2, two steps.

So for ring k, movements:

- Up: k steps? But in k=1, up:1 step? But above it was one step to move from (1,0) to (1,1), but that's one move, but the direction has length k? The number of cells covered in that direction segment.

Each "leg" of the spiral in ring k consists of a certain number of cells.

For ring k, the four legs:

- First leg (up): starts at (k,1-k), moves up to (k, k). Since y from 1-k to k, delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1? But number of steps is number of moves, which is number of cells minus one? No.

The segment includes several cells. For example, in up direction for ring k=1: cells at (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is the start, and it moves to (1,1), so only one new cell? But typically, the segment includes the cells moved to.

In ring k, the first segment (up) has k cells? For k=1: only one cell? But we have cell (1,1), which is new, but the start cell (1,0) is already counted as start.

Perhaps it's better to think that each direction segment has exactly k cells in it for ring k.

For k=1: up segment: cells (1,1) — only one cell, but k=1.

Left segment: cells (0,1), (-1,1) — two cells? Inconsistent.

From the start point, it moves in a direction for a certain distance.

I recall that for ring k, the first move is up, and it moves k times in that direction, but each "move" is to an adjacent cell, so moving k times means visiting k+1 cells? But that can't be.

Let's calculate the number of cells in each segment.

For ring k=1:

- From (1,0) to (1,1): cells: (1,1) — one new cell? But the start is already occupied, so new cells added: when moving from start, the first move adds one cell in up direction.

Then from there, move left twice: to (0,1) and (-1,1), so two new cells.

Then down twice: to (-1,0) and (-1,-1), but (-1,0) is new? From (-1,1) to (-1,0): new cell, then to (-1,-1): new cell.

Then right twice: to (0,-1) and (1,-1), new cells.

Total new cells: up:1, left:2, down:2, right:2, sum 7, but ring has 8 cells including start? The start cell is already there, so when we add the ring, we add 8 new cells, but the start cell is shared or not? In this case, for ring 1, cells 2 to 9 are new, 8 cells.

In the path: start at (1,0) (cell 2), move up to (1,1) (cell 3) — one move.

Then move left to (0,1) (cell 4), then to (-1,1) (cell 5) — two moves.

Then move down to (-1,0) (cell 6), then to (-1,-1) (cell 7) — two moves.

Then move right to (0,-1) (cell 8), then to (1,-1) (cell 9) — two moves.

So total moves: 1+2+2+2=7 moves, adding 7 new cells, but total cells in ring are 8? Cell 2 is the start, so when we begin, cell 2 is already placed, then we add cells 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 by the moves, so 7 new cells added, but ring has 8 cells: cells 2 through 9. Cell 2 is included at the start, so we add 7 more, total 8. But for the segments, the first segment (up) has only one cell added (cell 3), while others have two each.

For ring k, the number of cells in each segment is not constant.

Notice that for ring k, the first segment (up) has k cells? But for k=1, it has 1 cell, for k=2, let's see.

Ring k=2: starts at (2,-1): cell 10.

Move up: to (2,0):11, then (2,1):12? So to (2,1), which is y=1, while start y= -1, so from y=-1 to y=1, but only two moves: to (2,0), then (2,1), so cells added: 11 and 12, two cells.

Then move left: to (1,1):13, (0,1):14, (-1,1):15, (-2,1):16? So to x= -2, from x=2, delta x= -4, but moves: to (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-2,1) — four moves? Cells 13,14,15,16.

Then move down: to (-2,0):17, (-2,-1):18, (-2,-2):19? From y=1 to y=-2? Cells 17,18,19 — three moves? To (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2).

Then move right: to (-1,-2):20, (0,-2):21, (1,-2):22, (2,-2):23? But earlier I had up to 25, but 23 is (2,-2), then it should go to (2,-1)? But (2,-1) is already occupied by 10.

After (-2,-2), it moved right to (-1,-2):20, (0,-2):21, (1,-2):22, (2,-2):23, then from there, it should move up, but (2,-1) is occupied, so for ring 2, after (2,-2), it moves to (2,-1)? But that's the start, already occupied.

In my earlier sequence, I had after (2,-2):25? No, I think I missed some.

After moving down to (-2,-2): cell 19? Let's list:

Start (2,-1):10

Up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12

Left to (1,1):13, (0,1):14, (-1,1):15, (-2,1):16

Down to (-2,0):17, (-2,-1):18, (-2,-2):19

Then right to (-1,-2):20, (0,-2):21, (1,-2):22, (2,-2):23

Then from (2,-2), it should move up to (2,-1): but (2,-1) is already 10, occupied. But 24 and 25 are missing. I have only up to 23.

Mistake. After down to (-2,-2), it should move right, but to where? In standard spiral, after down to (-2,-2), it moves right, but only to (0,-2) or what? No, in my initial description, I had to (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25, but (2,-2) is at y=-2, x=2, then from there, to complete the ring, it should move up to (2,-1), but that's occupied.

For ring 2, after (2,-2), it moves up to (2,-1), but since it's the last cell, and (2,-1) is the start, but in numbering, it should be cell 24 at (2,-2)? Let's calculate the number.

From start: 10 at (2,-1)

11 at (2,0)

12 at (2,1)

13 at (1,1)

14 at (0,1)

15 at (-1,1)

16 at (-2,1)

17 at (-2,0)

18 at (-2,-1)

19 at (-2,-2)

20 at (-1,-2)

21 at (0,-2)

22 at (1,-2)

23 at (2,-2)

Now, from (2,-2), it should move to the next cell, which is up to (2,-1), but (2,-1) is already 10, so it can't. But we need to go to (2,-1) for cell 24? But it's occupied. I think I have a mistake in the sequence.

Perhaps after (2,-2), it moves to (3,-2) or something, but that's ring 3.

I recall that for ring k, the last cell is at (k-1, -k) or something. For k=2, last cell should be 25 at (2,-2)? But in my list, (2,-2) is 23, and 24 and 25 are missing.

From (2,-2), it should move up, but to (2,-1), which is occupied, so perhaps the direction is wrong.

Let's think: after placing 19 at (-2,-2), then it moves right to ( -1,-2):20, (0,-2):21, (1,-2):22, then to (2,-2):23, then since it can't go up because (2,-1) is occupied, but in spiral, after right, it should go up, but it's blocked, so for the last leg, it may have fewer steps.

For ring k, the first three legs have k cells each, and the last leg has k-1 cells or something.

For k=2:

- Up leg: from (2,-1) to (2,1): cells (2,0), (2,1) — two cells: 11,12. So 2 cells.

- Left leg: from (2,1) to (-2,1): cells (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-2,1) — four cells: 13,14,15,16.

- Down leg: from (-2,1) to (-2,-2): cells (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2) — three cells: 17,18,19.

- Right leg: from (-2,-2) to (2,-2)? But (2,-2) is not reached yet. Cells ( -1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) — four cells: 20,21,22,23.

But 24 and 25 are missing. 24 should be at (2,-1)? But occupied.

I see the problem: after the down leg to (-2,-2), it should move right, but to complete, it needs to go to (2,-2), but then from there to (2,-1), but (2,-1) is start.

In standard Ulam spiral, for ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k), moves up to (k,k), then left to (-k,k), then down to (-k,-k), then right to (k,-k), but for k=2, (k,-k)=(2,-2), but (2,-2) is the end, but in my list, when it moves right from (-2,-2) to (2,-2), it passes through ( -1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), so cells 20,21,22,23 at those positions, and then it is at (2,-2), which is cell 23, but the start is (2,-1), so cell 24 should be at (2,-1), but it's already occupied by 10.

This is incorrect. I think I have a fundamental mistake.

Let's list the positions for n=1 to 25.

- (0,0):1

- (1,0):2

- (1,1):3

- (0,1):4

- (-1,1):5

- (-1,0):6

- (-1,-1):7

- (0,-1):8

- (1,-1):9

- (2,-1):10

- (2,0):11

- (2,1):12

- (2,2):13? Then left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17

- then down to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21

- then right to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25

Ah! I see, after (2,1):12, it goes to (2,2):13, not to (1,1). I forgot that. In my earlier for ring 2, after up to (2,1), it should go left, but first to (2,2)? No, from (2,1), it should go up to (2,2)? But in the sequence, after 12 at (2,1), next is 13 at (2,2)? But (2,2) is up from (2,1), yes.

In the grid, for y=2, x=2:13, then left to x=1,y=2:14, x=0,y=2:15, x=-1,y=2:16, x=-2,y=2:17.

Then from (-2,2), down to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21.

Then from (-2,-2), right to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25.

And (2,-1) is already 10, so no problem.

So for ring k=2, starts at (2,-1):10

Then moves up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13 — so from y= -1 to y=2, delta y=3, but cells: 11,12,13 — three cells added? Positions: start at (2,-1), then move to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) — so cells at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are added, but start is (2,-1), so three new cells in up direction? But for k=2, should be k or what.

From start (2,-1), first move up to (2,0):11, then to (2,1):12, then to (2,2):13. So three moves in up direction, adding cells 11,12,13.

Then from (2,2), move left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17 — four moves? To (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2) — cells 14,15,16,17.

Then from (-2,2), move down to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21 — four moves? To (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2) — cells 18,19,20,21.

Then from (-2,-2), move right to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25 — four moves? To (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) — cells 22,23,24,25.

But total cells added: 3+4+4+4=15, but ring has 16 cells? Cells from 10 to 25 are 16 cells. Cell 10 is the start, so added cells are 11 to 25, which is 15 cells, yes.

But for the segments, the first segment (up) has 3 cells added (11,12,13), while others have 4 each.

Not consistent.

Notice that the up segment added cells with x=k, y from 1-k to k.

For k=2, x=2, y from -1+1=0? y from 0 to 2? Cells at y=0,1,2: 11,12,13, so y=0,1,2, which is from y= -(k-1) +1? k=2, -(2-1)+1=0, to k=2.

Start y= -(k-1) = -1 for k=2, but the cells added are from y= -1 +1 =0? The first cell added is at y=0, not at start y.

Perhaps the number of cells in each leg is k for the first, but here 3 for k=2.

For ring k, the side lengths are not constant.

From the start point, the first leg (up) has length k, meaning it adds k cells? For k=1: added 1 cell (3 at (1,1)). For k=2: added 3 cells (11,12,13). 1,3,5,... so 2k-1? For k=1, 2*1-1=1, yes; k=2,3, yes.

Then the next leg (left) adds how many? For k=1: added 2 cells (4 and 5). For k=2: added 4 cells (14,15,16,17). So 2,4,6,... so 2k.

Then down leg: for k=1: added 2 cells (6 and 7). k=2: added 4 cells (18,19,20,21). So 2k.

Then right leg: for k=1: added 2 cells (8 and 9). k=2: added 4 cells (22,23,24,25). So 2k.

But for k=1, total added: 1+2+2+2=7, plus start, 8 cells.

For k=2, 3+4+4+4=15, plus start, 16 cells, good.

But for the right leg, it added 2k cells, but in k=2, it added 4 cells, ending at (2,-2), while start was at (2,-1), so not closed yet.

After right leg, it is at (k, -k), and start was at (k, 1-k), so for k>1, 1-k > -k, so it's not the same point.

For the last cell, it is at (k, -k), but the start is at (k, 1-k), which is different if k>1.

In the numbering, for ring k, the cells are added, and the last cell is at (k, -k).

For k=1: last cell is (1,-1):9, start (1,0):2.

For k=2: last cell (2,-2):25, start (2,-1):10.

Now for our case, k=23, 2026 is the first number of ring 23, so it is at the start position: (k, 1-k) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

Now I need to find the eight neighbors of this cell.

The cell at (23, -22).

Its neighbors are:

- Right: (24, -22)

- Left: (22, -22)

- Up: (23, -21)

- Down: (23, -23)

- Diagonals: (24,-21), (24,-23), (22,-21), (22,-23)

But I need to know what numbers are at these positions, but since the spiral is filled, some of these cells may not be filled yet or may be filled with different numbers, but since the spiral is infinite and covers all integer coordinates eventually, all these cells are occupied by some number, but I need to find which number is at each neighbor cell.

The neighbors are at specific coordinates, and I need the number at those coordinates.

Since the spiral is symmetric, but the numbering depends on the path.

I could find the number at a given coordinate, but it might be easier to find for each neighbor coordinate, what is the number there.

Since I need the sum of neighbors, and perhaps there is symmetry, but the grid is symmetric, but the numbering is not symmetric because the spiral is counter-clockwise, so the values may not be symmetric.

For a cell at (x,y), I can find which ring it is in, and its position in the ring.

The rings are defined by the max norm: the ring k is where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, cell (x,y), let k = max(|x|,|y|), then it is in ring k.

For example, (0,0): k=0.

(1,0): k=1.

(1,1): k=1.

(2,-1): k=2, since max(2,1)=2.

(2,2): k=2.

(-2,-2): k=2.

Now, within ring k, there are 8k cells, as we know.

The cells in ring k are those with max(|x|,|y|) = k.

The start of the ring is at (k, 1-k), as we have.

Now, to find the position of a cell (x,y) in ring k.

The ring is traversed in order: start at (k,1-k), then move up to (k,k), then move left to (-k,k), then move down to (-k,-k), then move right to (k,-k).

And the number of cells in each segment.

From earlier, for a cell in ring k, we can find where it is in the path.

The total number of cells before ring k is the sum of rings 0 to k-1.

Ring 0: 1 cell.

Ring m for m>=1: 8m cells.

So sum from m=1 to k-1 of 8m = 8 * (k-1)k/2 = 4k(k-1).

Plus ring 0: 1, so total cells before ring k: 1 + 4k(k-1) = 4k^2 - 4k +1 = (2k-1)^2.

Which matches what we had earlier, since ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1.

Now, within ring k, we need the offset.

The path in ring k:

- Start at (k, 1-k)

- Move up: adding cells with x=k, y from 1-k +1 to k? The first cell added is at (k, 1-k +1) = (k, 2-k)? For k=2, start (2,-1), first move to (2,0), so y=0, which is 2-k? k=2, 2-2=0, yes.

Generally, when moving up, it adds cells at (k, y) for y = (1-k) +1 to k, i.e., from y=2-k to y=k.

For k=2: y=2-2=0 to y=2, so y=0,1,2: cells (2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — yes, 11,12,13.

Number of cells in this segment: from y=2-k to y=k, inclusive.

The values of y: from 2-k to k.

Number of integers: k - (2-k) + 1 = k -2 +k +1 = 2k -1.

As we had earlier.

The y-coordinates range from 2-k to k, step 1, so number is k - (2-k) + 1 = 2k -1.

Yes.

After this, we are at (k,k).

Then move left: adding cells with y=k, x from k-1 down to -k.

From (k,k) to (-k,k), so x from k-1 to -k, decreasing.

First move to (k-1,k), then (k-2,k), ..., down to (-k,k).

So x from k-1 down to -k, inclusive.

Number of cells: x=k-1,k-2,...,-k. So from -k to k-1, which has (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=2: x=1,0,-1,-2? Cells (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17 — x=1,0,-1,-2, which is from 1 to -2, number is 1 - (-2) +1=4, yes 2k=4.

After this, at (-k,k).

Then move down: adding cells with x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k.

From (-k,k) to (-k,-k), so y from k-1 down to -k.

Cells: y=k-1,k-2,...,-k.

Number: from -k to k-1, so (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1+k+1=2k.

For k=2: y=1,0,-1,-2? But y=k-1=1, down to -k=-2, so y=1,0,-1,-2: cells (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21 — yes, 4 cells.

After this, at (-k,-k).

Then move right: adding cells with y=-k, x from -k+1 to k.

From (-k,-k) to (k,-k), so x from -k+1 to k.

Cells: x=-k+1, -k+2, ..., k.

Number: from -k+1 to k, so k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

For k=2: x=-1,0,1,2: cells (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25 — yes.

So summary for ring k:

- Segment 1 (up): x=k, y from 2-k to k. Number of cells: 2k-1.

- Segment 2 (left): y=k, x from k-1 down to -k. Number: 2k.

- Segment 3 (down): x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k. Number: 2k.

- Segment 4 (right): y=-k, x from -k+1 to k. Number: 2k.

Total: (2k-1) + 2k + 2k + 2k = 8k, good.

Now, the start of the ring is at offset 0: cell number (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Then, after segment 1, we have added 2k-1 cells, so we are at cell number start + (2k-1).

But since the segments are sequential, the offset within the ring is cumulative.

Specifically:

- Cells in segment 1: offset 0 to (2k-1)-1? Let's define the offset from the start of the ring.

Let s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1, the first cell of ring k.

Then:

- Segment 1: cells from s_k to s_k + (2k-2) ? Since number of cells is 2k-1, so indices from 0 to (2k-2) in offset.

The offset delta: from 0 to m-1 for m cells.

So for segment 1: delta = 0 to (2k-2), since 2k-1 cells, delta from 0 to (2k-2).

The cell at delta has number s_k + delta.

But we need to map coordinate to delta.

For a given cell (x,y) in ring k, i.e., max(|x|,|y|)=k.

Now, depending on which segment it is in.

Case 1: if it is in segment 1, which is the up segment: x=k, and y between 2-k and k inclusive.

In this segment, x is fixed at k, y varies from 2-k to k.

The y values: y_min = 2-k, y_max = k.

The delta offset: when y = y_min = 2-k, it is the first cell, so delta=0.

As y increases, delta increases.

Since it moves up, y increases, and delta increases linearly with y.

y ranges from 2-k to k, so y - (2-k) ranges from 0 to k - (2-k) = 2k-2.

Number of steps: from y=2-k to y=k, delta y = k - (2-k) = 2k-2, so delta = y - (2-k).

Since at y=2-k, delta=0; y=2-k+1, delta=1; ... y=k, delta=2k-2.

For example, k=2, y from 0 to 2: at y=0, delta=0? But in segment, first cell is at (2,0):11, which is the first of segment, but in the ring, start is at (2,-1):10, so delta for (2,0) should be 1? Offset from start.

The start cell is (k,1-k), which for segment 1, but the segment starts after the start cell? No.

In our case, for ring k, the start cell (k,1-k) is included in the ring, but which segment?

In the path, we start at (k,1-k), then we move to the next cell in the segment.

For segment 1, the cells are: starting from (k,1-k)? But in the segment description, for segment 1, we said cells with x=k, y from 2-k to k.

But for k=2, y from 0 to 2, but the start cell is at (2,-1), y=-1, which is not in this range.

I think I made a mistake.

In the path, the start cell (k,1-k) is the first cell of the ring.

Then, when we move up, we add new cells: first to (k,1-k +1) = (k,2-k), then to (k,3-k), ..., up to (k,k).

So for k=2: start at (2,-1), move up to (2,0), then (2,1), then (2,2). So the cells added in the up move are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), while the start cell (2,-1) is already there.

So in segment 1, the cells are (k,y) for y = 2-k, 3-k, ..., k. Which is y from 2-k to k.

But the start cell (k,1-k) is not in this segment; it is the start, and segment 1 adds the next cells.

In terms of the path, the start cell is visited first, then segment 1 adds cells as we move up.

But for the coordinate (k,1-k), it is the start, not in segment 1.

To find the cell at (x,y), we need to see if it is the start or in one of the segments.

For a cell in ring k, it is:

- Either the start cell: (k,1-k)

- Or in segment 1: x=k, y > 1-k, and y <= k. Since max|y|<=k, and x=k, so y from 1-k+1=2-k to k.

- Or in segment 2: y=k, x < k, and x >= -k. But since max|x|=k, and y=k, so x from -k to k, but not x=k because if x=k and y=k, that's the end of segment 1, which is included in segment 1.

Segment 2 is for y=k, x from k-1 down to -k.

- Segment 3: x=-k, y < k, and y >= -k. Specifically y from k-1 down to -k.

- Segment 4: y=-k, x > -k, and x <= k. Specifically x from -k+1 to k.

And the start cell is only (k,1-k).

Now for each, we can find the offset.

Define the offset delta from the start of the ring, where delta=0 for the start cell.

Then:

- If (x,y) is the start cell: delta=0.

- If in segment 1: x=k, y from 2-k to k.

The first cell of segment 1 is (k,2-k), which should be delta=1, since start is delta=0.

Then as y increases, delta increases.

y ranges from 2-k to k, number of cells: 2k-1.

At y=2-k, delta=1

y=3-k, delta=2

...

y=k, delta= (k) - (2-k) + 1? The difference in y: from 2-k to y, the number of steps is y - (2-k).

Since at y=2-k, delta=1; y=2-k+1, delta=2; ... y=k, delta=1 + [k - (2-k)] = 1 + (k -2 +k) = 1 + 2k -2 = 2k-1.

For k=2, y=0: delta=1? Cell (2,0):11, start is (2,-1):10, so number s_k + delta = 10 + delta, so for (2,0), number should be 11, so delta=1.

At y=1: (2,1):12, delta=2

y=2: (2,2):13, delta=3.

And 2k-1=3 for k=2, yes, at y=k=2, delta=3=2k-1.

General formula: for segment 1, delta = 1 + (y - (2-k)) = y -2 +k +1 = y + k -1.

Since at y=2-k, delta=1 = (2-k) + k -1 = 2-k+k-1=1, yes.

At y=k, delta=k + k -1=2k-1, correct.

Now, after segment 1, we have added 2k-1 cells (delta from 1 to 2k-1), so next segment starts at delta=2k.

Segment 2: y=k, x from k-1 down to -k.

First cell: (k-1,k), delta=2k.

Then as x decreases, delta increases.

x ranges from k-1 to -k, decreasing.

At x=k-1, delta=2k

x=k-2, delta=2k+1

...

x=-k, delta=?

The values of x: k-1, k-2, ..., -k.

Number of cells: 2k, as before.

The sequence: x starts at k-1, ends at -k.

The difference: from k-1 to x, since decreasing, the number of steps is (k-1) - x.

At x=k-1, delta=2k

x=k-2, delta=2k+1

So delta = 2k + [(k-1) - x]

Because when x=k-1, (k-1)-x=0, delta=2k

x=k-2, (k-1)-(k-2)=1, delta=2k+1

x=-k, (k-1)-(-k)=k-1+k=2k-1, delta=2k + (2k-1) = 4k-1

But total delta should go up to 2k + (2k -1) = 4k-1? Since 2k cells, delta from 2k to 2k + 2k -1 = 4k-1.

For k=2: delta from 2*2=4 to 4*2-1=7? Cells: (1,2):14, delta=4? Start delta=0:10, so (1,2) should be s_k + delta=10+4=14, yes.

(0,2):15, delta=5? 10+5=15, yes.

(-1,2):16, delta=6

(-2,2):17, delta=7? 10+7=17, yes. And 4k-1=8-1=7, yes.

General: delta = 2k + (k-1 - x)

Since x decreases, k-1 - x increases as x decreases.

Now, segment 3: down, x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k.

First cell: (-k, k-1), which should be after segment 2 ends at delta=4k-1, so next delta=4k.

At y=k-1, delta=4k

Then as y decreases, delta increases.

y ranges from k-1 down to -k.

At y=k-1, delta=4k

y=k-2, delta=4k+1

...

y=-k, delta=?

Difference: (k-1) - y, since y decreases.

At y=k-1, (k-1)-y=0, delta=4k

y=k-2, (k-1)-(k-2)=1, delta=4k+1

y=-k, (k-1)-(-k)=k-1+k=2k-1, delta=4k + (2k-1) = 6k-1

Total cells: 2k, delta from 4k to 4k + 2k -1 = 6k-1, yes.

So delta = 4k + (k-1 - y)

Now, segment 4: right, y=-k, x from -k+1 to k.

First cell: (-k+1, -k), after segment 3 ends at delta=6k-1, so delta=6k.

At x=-k+1, delta=6k

x=-k+2, delta=6k+1

...

x=k, delta=?

x ranges from -k+1 to k, increasing.

At x=-k+1, delta=6k

x=-k+2, delta=6k+1

...

x=k, delta=6k + [k - (-k+1)] ? The difference: x - (-k+1)

At x=-k+1, x - (-k+1)=0, delta=6k

x=-k+2, x - (-k+1)=1, delta=6k+1

x=k, k - (-k+1)=k +k -1=2k-1, delta=6k + (2k-1) = 8k-1

Total cells: 2k, delta from 6k to 6k + 2k -1 = 8k-1, yes.

So delta = 6k + (x - (-k + 1)) = 6k + x + k - 1 = x + 7k - 1

Since -(-k+1) = k-1.

delta = 6k + (x - (-k + 1)) = 6k + x + k - 1 = x + 7k - 1

Now, we have all cases.

Summary for a cell (x,y) in ring k (max(|x|,|y|)=k):

- If x=k and y=1-k: start cell, delta=0

- Else if x=k and 2-k ≤ y ≤ k: segment 1, delta = y + k - 1

- Else if y=k and -k ≤ x ≤ k-1: segment 2, delta = 2k + (k-1 - x)

- Else if x=-k and -k ≤ y ≤ k-1: segment 3, delta = 4k + (k-1 - y)

- Else if y=-k and -k+1 ≤ x ≤ k: segment 4, delta = x + 7k - 1

Note that the conditions cover all cells in ring k, since max(|x|,|y|)=k, and the cases partition the ring.

Now, the number at (x,y) is s_k + delta, where s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

Now, back to our problem: we need the neighbors of the cell containing 2026.

We found that 2026 is the first cell of ring k=23, so it is at (x,y) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22)

So coordinates (23, -22)

Now, its eight neighbors are:

- Right: (24, -22)

- Left: (22, -22)

- Up: (23, -21)

- Down: (23, -23)

- Up-right: (24, -21)

- Up-left: (22, -21)

- Down-right: (24, -23)

- Down-left: (22, -23)

Now, for each of these coordinates, I need to find which ring they are in, and then the number at that coordinate.

Note that since the cell is at (23,-22), ring k=23, max(|x|,|y|)=max(23,22)=23.

The neighbors may be in different rings.

Specifically:

- (24,-22): max(|24|,|-22|)=max(24,22)=24, so ring k=24

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, ring k=22

- (23,-21): max(23,21)=23, same ring

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, same ring

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, ring 24

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, ring 22

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, same ring? |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, yes ring 23.

List:

- (24,-22): k=24

- (22,-22): k=22

- (23,-21): k=23

- (23,-23): k=23

- (24,-21): k=24

- (22,-21): k=22

- (24,-23): k=24

- (22,-23): k=23

So neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

In ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

In ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

(22,-22) and (22,-21) are in ring 22.

(23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23) in ring 23.

(24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23) in ring 24.

Now, I need to compute the number at each of these coordinates.

First, recall s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

For each neighbor, find k, then find delta, then number = s_k + delta.

Start with ring 22 neighbors: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, k=22 for both.

s_{22} = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

Now, for (22,-22)

Is it the start cell? Start cell for ring 22 is (22,1-22)=(22,-21)? 1-k=1-22=-21, so (22,-21)

But we have (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, (22,-21): this is exactly the start cell for ring 22, since (k,1-k)=(22,-21)

So for (22,-21): delta=0, so number = s_{22} + 0 = 1850

Now, (22,-22): now, is it in a segment?

x=22=k, y=-22

Now, compare to start: start is (22,-21), so y=-22 < -21? 1-k=-21, so y=-22.

Now, is it in segment 1? Segment 1 requires x=k=22, and y between 2-k and k, i.e., 2-22=-20 to 22.

y=-22, which is less than -20? -22 < -20, so not in segment 1.

Segment 2: y=k=22? But y=-22 ≠22.

Segment 3: x=-k? But x=22 ≠ -22.

Segment 4: y=-k? k=22, y=-22, so y=-k.

And segment 4 requires y=-k, and x between -k+1 and k, i.e., -22+1=-21 to 22.

x=22, which is within -21 to 22? -21 ≤ 22 ≤ 22, yes.

So in segment 4.

For segment 4, delta = x + 7k -1

x=22, k=22, delta=22 + 7*22 -1=22+154-1=175

So number = s_{22} + delta = 1850 + 175 = 2025

2025? But 2025 is in ring 22? Ring 22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, yes, and since it's the last cell, should be at (22,-22)? Earlier for ring k, last cell is at (k,-k), so for k=22, (22,-22), yes, and since it's the end, delta should be maximum.

Total cells in ring: 8*22=176, so delta from 0 to 175, so delta=175 is the last cell, number s_k + 175 = 1850 + 175 = 2025, yes.

Now, next neighbors in ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

k=23

s_{23} = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026

But 2026 is the start cell, which is (23,-22)? (k,1-k)=(23,-22), yes.

Now, neighbors:

First, (23,-21): x=23=k, y=-21

Is it start? Start is (23,-22), y=-21 ≠ -22, so no.

Segment 1: x=k=23, y between 2-k and k, i.e., 2-23=-21 to 23.

y=-21, which is equal to -21, so within [-21,23].

So in segment 1.

Delta for segment 1: delta = y + k -1 = -21 + 23 -1 = 1

So number = s_{23} + delta = 2026 + 1 = 2027

Now, (23,-23): x=23=k, y=-23

Segment 1: y between -21 and 23? -23 < -21, so no.

Segment 2: y=k=23? y=-23≠23.

Segment 3: x=-k? x=23≠-23.

Segment 4: y=-k? k=23, y=-23, so yes.

x between -k+1 and k, i.e., -23+1=-22 to 23.

x=23, which is within -22 to 23, yes.

So segment 4, delta = x + 7k -1 = 23 + 7*23 -1 = 23 + 161 -1 = 183

So number = 2026 + 183 = 2209? But ring 23 ends at 47^2=2209, yes, and last cell is (23,-23), so should be 2209, yes.

Now, (22,-23): x=22, y=-23

k=23, max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,23)=23, yes.

Now, which segment?

x=22, y=-23

Start cell: (23,-22)

Is it segment 1? x=k=23? but x=22≠23.

Segment 2: y=k=23? y=-23≠23.

Segment 3: x=-k? x=22≠-23.

Segment 4: y=-k? y=-23, k=23, so y=-k.

x between -k+1 and k, i.e., -23+1=-22 to 23.

x=22, which is within -22 to 23, yes.

So segment 4, delta = x + 7k -1 = 22 + 7*23 -1 = 22 + 161 -1 = 182

So number = s_{23} + 182 = 2026 + 182 = 2208

Now, neighbors in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

k=24

s_{24} = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Now, each:

First, (24,-22): x=24=k, y=-22

Is it start? Start for ring 24 is (24,1-24)=(24,-23)

So not start.

Segment 1: x=k=24, y between 2-k and k, i.e., 2-24=-22 to 24.

y=-22, which is equal to -22, so within [-22,24].

So segment 1.

Delta = y + k -1 = -22 + 24 -1 = 1

So number = 2210 + 1 = 2211

Now, (24,-21): x=24=k, y=-21

Segment 1: y between -22 and 24, y=-21 > -22, so yes.

Delta = y + k -1 = -21 + 24 -1 = 2

Number = 2210 + 2 = 2212

Now, (24,-23): x=24=k, y=-23

Segment 1: y between -22 and 24? y=-23 < -22, so no.

Segment 2: y=k=24? y=-23≠24.

Segment 3: x=-k? x=24≠-24.

Segment 4: y=-k? k=24, y=-23 ≠ -24? -23 ≠ -24, so no.

But it must be in some segment. y=-23, k=24, |y|=23 < k=24? But max(|x|,|y|)=max(24,23)=24, so it is in ring 24.

Now, why not in segments? Segment 4 requires y=-k=-24, but here y=-23 ≠ -24.

What's wrong?

The segments: segment 1: x=k, y>=2-k and y<=k

2-k=2-24=-22, y=-23 < -22? -23 < -22, so not in segment 1.

Segment 2: y=k=24, but y=-23≠24.

Segment 3: x=-k=-24, but x=24≠-24.

Segment 4: y=-k=-24, but y=-23≠-24.

But the start cell is (24,-23)? Start is (k,1-k)=(24,1-24)=(24,-23)

Oh! So (24,-23) is the start cell for ring 24.

Because (x,y)=(24,-23), and k=24, start is (24,-23), yes.

So it is the start cell, delta=0.

So number = s_{24} + 0 = 2210

Now, we have all neighbors:

List them:

1. (22,-22): ring 22, segment 4, number=2025

2. (22,-21): ring 22, start, number=1850

3. (23,-21): ring 23, segment 1, number=2027

4. (23,-23): ring 23, segment 4, number=2209? Earlier 2026 + 183 = 2209

5. (24,-22): ring 24, segment 1, number=2211

6. (24,-21): ring 24, segment 1, number=2212

7. (24,-23): ring 24, start, number=2210

8. (22,-23): ring 23, segment 4, number=2208? Earlier 2026 + 182 = 2208

Now, list the numbers:

- (22,-22): 2025

- (22,-21): 1850

- (23,-21): 2027

- (23,-23): 2209

- (24,-22): 2211

- (24,-21): 2212

- (24,-23): 2210

- (22,-23): 2208

Now, sum them up.

List:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Group them.

First, the two in ring 22: 1850 and 2025

Sum: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Then ring 23 neighbors: (23,-21):2027, (23,-23):2209, (22,-23):2208

Sum: 2027 + 2208 + 2209

Compute: 2027 + 2208 = 4235, plus 2209 = 6444

2027 + 2209 = 4236, plus 2208 = 6444? 4236 + 2208 = 6444, yes.

Now ring 24 neighbors: (24,-22):2211, (24,-21):2212, (24,-23):2210

Sum: 2211 + 2212 + 2210

2211 + 2210 = 4421, plus 2212 = 6633? 4421 + 2212 = 6633.

2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 2210 + 2212 = 4422, plus 2211 = 6633, same.

Now total sum: ring22 sum + ring23 sum + ring24 sum = 3875 + 6444 + 6633

First, 3875 + 6444 = 10319

Then 10319 + 6633 = 16952

Compute: 10319 + 6600 = 16919, plus 33 = 16952.

So sum is 16952.

But let me double-check the numbers.

First, ring22:

(22,-21): start, s22=1850, delta=0, num=1850

(22,-22): segment4, delta=x+7k-1=22+7*22-1=22+154-1=175, num=1850+175=2025, correct.

Ring23:

(23,-21): segment1, delta=y+k-1=-21+23-1=1, num=2026+1=2027

(23,-23): segment4, delta=x+7k-1=23+7*23-1=23+161-1=183, num=2026+183=2209

(22,-23): segment4? x=22,y=-23,k=23

delta=x+7k-1=22+7*23-1=22+161-1=182, num=2026+182=2208

Ring24:

(24,-22): segment1, delta=y+k-1=-22+24-1=1, num=2210+1=2211

(24,-21): segment1, delta=y+k-1=-21+24-1=2, num=2210+2=2212

(24,-23): start, delta=0, num=2210

All seem correct.

Now sum: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Add them step by step.

Pair them:

1850 + 2212 = 4062? 1850+2200=4050, +12=4062? Better to add sequentially.

List in order:

1850

2025

2027

2208

2209

2210

2211

2212

Add first and last: 1850 + 2212 = 4062

Second and second last: 2025 + 2211 = 4236

Third and third last: 2027 + 2210 = 4237

Then the middle two: 2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062, 4236, 4237, 4417

Now 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952

Same as before.

Notice that some are consecutive: like 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are consecutive, but not all.

2025,2027 are close, but missing 2026 which is the center.

Anyway, sum is 16952.

But is this correct? The center is 2026, and neighbors include 2025,2027, which are adjacent, but also others.

In the spiral, the neighbors should include immediate adjacent numbers, but in this case, since it's the start of a ring, some neighbors might be in different rings.

But according to calculation, it should be fine.

I could verify with a smaller number.

For example, take the center 1 at (0,0). Its neighbors: should be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? But in the grid, neighbors are the eight surrounding cells.

In the spiral, at (0,0):1

Neighbors: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9. Sum=2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

Now according to our method: 1 is in ring 0, but ring 0 has only one cell, neighbors are in ring 1.

But in our case, 2026 is on the boundary, not center.

Take another example. Say number 10, which is start of ring 2, at (2,-1)

Neighbors: 

- Right: (3,-1)? But ring 3 starts at (3,-2), etc.

Coordinates: (2,-1)

Neighbors:

(3,-1), (1,-1), (2,0), (2,-2), (3,0), (3,-2), (1,0), (1,-2)

Now, numbers:

(1,-1):9? From earlier, (1,-1) is 9.

(1,0):2? (1,0) is 2.

(1,-2):24? Earlier for ring2, (1,-2):24? In ring2, (1,-2) is segment4? k=2, x=1,y=-2

s2=(3)^2 +1=10? Earlier we had s2=10 for ring2.

(1,-2): segment4? y=-k? k=2, y=-2, yes. delta=x+7k-1=1+14-1=14, num=10+14=24, yes.

(2,0):11? In ring2, segment1, delta=y+k-1=0+2-1=1, num=10+1=11.

(2,-2):25? Segment4? delta=x+7k-1=2+14-1=15? But max delta=8*2-1=15? s2+15=10+15=25, yes.

(3,-1): ring3? k=max(3,1)=3, s3=(5)^2+1=26? Start is (3,-2)? (k,1-k)=(3,-2)

(3,-1): segment1? x=3=k, y=-1, between 2-k=-1? 2-3=-1, and k=3, y=-1 >= -1, <=3, yes. delta=y+k-1=-1+3-1=1, num=26+1=27.

(3,0): segment1? x=3,y=0, between -1 and 3, yes. delta=0+3-1=2? num=26+2=28.

(3,-2): start? (3,-2), start of ring3, num=26.

(1,0): ring1? k=max(1,0)=1, s1=(1)^2+1=2? Start (1,0)? (k,1-k)=(1,0), yes, so num=2.

(1,-2): ring2? k=max(1,2)=2, s2=10. (1,-2): as above, num=24.

Now neighbors: (3,-1):27, (1,-1):9, (2,0):11, (2,-2):25, (3,0):28, (3,-2):26, (1,0):2, (1,-2):24

Sum: 27+9=36, +11=47, +25=72, +28=100, +26=126, +2=128, +24=152.

Now actual neighbors: list:

- Up: (2,0):11

- Down: (2,-2):25? But (2,-1) is itself? Neighbors should not include itself.

The neighbors are adjacent cells, so:

- North: (2,-1+1)=(2,0):11

- South: (2,-1-1)=(2,-2):25

- East: (2+1,-1)=(3,-1):27

- West: (2-1,-1)=(1,-1):9

- NE: (3,0):28? (3,-1+1)=(3,0):28

- NW: (1,0):2? (1,-1+1)=(1,0):2

- SE: (3,-2):26? (3,-1-1)=(3,-2):26

- SW: (1,-2):24? (1,-1-1)=(1,-2):24

Same as above: 11,25,27,9,28,2,26,24 sum to 152 as above.

Now according to our calculation for 10, sum is 152.

Is there a pattern? But anyway, for our problem, we have computed.

Now back to 2026, sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the sum again.

List of numbers:

From ring22: 1850 and 2025

1850 + 2025 = 3875

From ring23: 2027, 2208, 2209

2027 + 2208 = 4235

4235 + 2209 = 6444

From ring24: 2210, 2211, 2212

2210 + 2211 = 4421

4421 + 2212 = 6633

Now total: 3875 + 6444 = 10319

10319 + 6633 = 16952

Note that 1850 + 2025 = 3875

2027 + 2208 + 2209 = let's see, 2027 + 2209 = 4236, plus 2208 = 6444, yes.

2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 2211 * 3 = 6633, since symmetric, yes.

Now 3875 + 6444 = 10319

10319 + 6633: 10319 + 6000 = 16319, +633 = 16319 + 600 = 16919, +33 = 16952.

So sum is 16952.

Therefore, the sum of all eight neighbors is 16952.

But the problem asks for the sum, and I think this is it.

So answer should be 16952.

But let me see if I missed any neighbor or double-counted.

The neighbors are eight distinct cells, all different coordinates, and we computed each number correctly, so should be fine.

Notice that in the sum, we have numbers from different rings, but that's expected.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at the coordinates (23, -22) in the spiral, as it is the first number in ring 23, which starts at (23, 1 - 23) = (23, -22). The eight neighbors of this cell are at the following coordinates:

- (22, -22)
- (22, -21)
- (23, -21)
- (23, -23)
- (24, -22)
- (24, -21)
- (24, -23)
- (22, -23)

To find the numbers at these coordinates, determine the ring (k) for each neighbor, where k = max(|x|, |y|), and compute the number using the formula for the start of the ring, s_k = (2k - 1)^2 + 1, and the offset delta based on the segment within the ring.

The neighbors and their corresponding numbers are:

- (22, -22): Ring k = 22, segment 4, delta = x + 7k - 1 = 22 + 7*22 - 1 = 175, number = s_{22} + delta = (43)^2 + 1 + 175 = 1849 + 1 + 175 = 2025
- (22, -21): Ring k = 22, start cell, delta = 0, number = s_{22} + 0 = (43)^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850
- (23, -21): Ring k = 23, segment 1, delta = y + k - 1 = -21 + 23 - 1 = 1, number = s_{23} + delta = (45)^2 + 1 + 1 = 2025 + 1 + 1 = 2027
- (23, -23): Ring k = 23, segment 4, delta = x + 7k - 1 = 23 + 7*23 - 1 = 23 + 161 - 1 = 183, number = s_{23} + delta = (45)^2 + 1 + 183 = 2025 + 1 + 183 = 2209
- (24, -22): Ring k = 24, segment 1, delta = y + k - 1 = -22 + 24 - 1 = 1, number = s_{24} + delta = (47)^2 + 1 + 1 = 2209 + 1 + 1 = 2211
- (24, -21): Ring k = 24, segment 1, delta = y + k - 1 = -21 + 24 - 1 = 2, number = s_{24} + delta = (47)^2 + 1 + 2 = 2209 + 1 + 2 = 2212
- (24, -23): Ring k = 24, start cell, delta = 0, number = s_{24} + 0 = (47)^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210
- (22, -23): Ring k = 23, segment 4, delta = x + 7k - 1 = 22 + 7*23 - 1 = 22 + 161 - 1 = 182, number = s_{23} + delta = (45)^2 + 1 + 182 = 2025 + 1 + 182 = 2208

The numbers at the neighbor coordinates are: 2025, 1850, 2027, 2209, 2211, 2212, 2210, 2208.

Sum these numbers:
- 1850 + 2025 = 3875
- 2027 + 2208 + 2209 = 2027 + 2209 = 4236, 4236 + 2208 = 6444
- 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 2210 + 2212 = 4422, 4422 + 2211 = 6633
- Total: 3875 + 6444 = 10319, 10319 + 6633 = 16952

The sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
