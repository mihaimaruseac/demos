<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand how the spiral is laid out. It seems centered around 1, with numbers increasing outward.

Let me sketch this out. Starting from the center:

At the center is 1.

Moving right: 2

Then down: 3? No, looking at the grid:

It shows:

5 4 3

6 1 2

7 8 9

So, above 1 is 4? Let's see:

The grid is given as:

Row 1: ... 5 4 3 ... but probably it's a small part.

From the context, it's a spiral starting at 1 in the center.

Typically, these spirals start at 1, then move right to 2, then down to 3, left to 4,5, etc., but here it's shown differently.

In the given grid:

- Position: let's assume the center is at (0,0) with number 1.

Then, to the right (east) is 2, so (1,0) is 2.

Above (north) is 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 4? Confusion.

The grid is:

Probably, the numbers are arranged as:

Let me denote coordinates. Set (0,0) as the center, with 1.

Then, according to the grid:

- At (1,0): east, should be 2? But in the grid, to the right of 1 is 2, yes.

In the second row: 6,1,2 so x increases to the right, y increases downward? Usually in math, y increases upward, but in grids, often y increases downward.

To avoid confusion, let's define:

Set the center (0,0) = 1.

Immediately to the right (positive x-direction): (1,0) = 2.

Then, above it? The grid shows above 1 is 4? Let's see:

The first row has 5,4,3. So probably, (0,1) is above? But if y increases upward, then (0,1) would be north of (0,0).

But in the grid, above 1 is 4? The grid is:

Row 1: say y=1: numbers 5,4,3? But centered? Probably, for y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But then below y=0: but center is y=0?

Assume that the grid is oriented with y increasing upward, x increasing right.

So, center (0,0) = 1.

To the east: (1,0) = 2.

Now, above (north): (0,1) should be? In the grid, it shows above 1 is 4? But 2 is to the right, so probably next is north.

But in the sequence, after 2, it should be 3. Where is 3? In the grid, at (1,1)? The grid shows:

At position: let's list:

- (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2 (east)

- (0,1): ? grid shows above 1 is 4, but that can't be because 3 should be somewhere.

Perhaps y increases downward. In many computer graphics, y increases downward.

Let me check the given grid:

It says:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So, if we assume that the rows are from top to bottom, so first row is top: 5,4,3

Second row: 6,1,2

Third row: 7,8,9

So, for second row, x=0:1, x=1:2? So x increases right.

y increases downward, since first row is top.

So, let's define coordinates:

Set (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing down.

Center: (0,0) = 1

East: (1,0) = 2

Then, the spiral goes south? Because below 1 is 8? But 3 should be next.

After 2, it should go to 3. Where is 3? In the top row, at (1,-1)? Let's see the positions.

From the grid:

- At (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2

- (1,-1): ? top row has x=1,y=0? Define y=0 at center.

Center is second row, so let's say row y=0: contains 6,1,2 so positions: x=-1:6? The row is "...6,1,2..." so probably x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2.

Similarly, row above, y=-1: "...5,4,3..." so x=-1:5? But 5 is at left, 4 center? The dots suggest it's part of larger grid, but for this segment, likely:

For y=-1 (top row): x=-1:5? But 5 is mentioned, and 4,3, so probably x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But then below at y=0: x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2

Below at y=1: x=-1:7? But it says 7,8,9 so probably x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9

But then at (0,1) is 8, which is south of center.

Now, the sequence: 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then 3 should be next, but at (1,-1) is 3? y=-1 is above, x=1.

In the grid, at (1,-1): from top row, x=1,y=-1:3

Then next should be 4 at (0,-1), which is given as 4? Top row x=0,y=-1:4

Then 5 at (-1,-1):5

Then 6 at (-1,0):6 (since y=0,x=-1:6)

Then 7 at (-1,1):7 (bottom row x=-1,y=1:7)

Then 8 at (0,1):8

Then 9 at (1,1):9

Then next would be 10 at (2,1) or something, but not shown.

So the spiral order is: start at (0,0):1

Move right to (1,0):2

Move up to (1,-1):3? But y increases downward, so moving to (1,-1) is moving upward? If y increases down, then negative y is up.

So from (1,0) move north to (1,-1):3

Then move west to (0,-1):4

Then move west to (-1,-1):5

Then move south to (-1,0):6

Then move south to (-1,1):7

Then move east to (0,1):8

Then move east to (1,1):9

Then move north to (1,2)? But next should be 10, but (1,1) is 9, move north would be to (1,0) but that's occupied, so probably it moves to (2,1) or something.

After (1,1):9, the next number should be 10. Since it's a spiral, it should go to the next layer.

From (1,1), it should move east to (2,1):10? But let's see the direction.

Typically, after completing a circle, it moves right to start the next layer.

After 9 at (1,1), the last move was east to (1,1). To continue, it should move north, but north is (1,0) which is occupied by 2, so instead it moves east to (2,1):10.

Then north to (2,0):11? Let's confirm.

General pattern: the spiral moves in layers. Each "layer" or "ring" around the center.

The center is layer 0, with only 1.

Then layer 1: numbers 2 to 9? 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 8 numbers.

Layer 2: 10 to 25? 10 through 25 is 16 numbers? Let me calculate.

The k-th ring has how many numbers.

The center is n=0, number 1.

First ring: around it, from 2 to 9, which is 8 numbers.

Second ring: from 10 to 25? 25-10+1=16 numbers.

Third ring: probably 24 numbers, since each ring adds 8 more? 8,16,24,... so increment by 8 each time? But 16-8=8, 24-16=8, yes.

The number of elements in the k-th ring: for k=1,2,3,... 

The rings start at certain numbers.

The last number of the k-th ring: since each ring has 8k numbers? For k=1, 8*1=8 numbers: 2 to 9.

k=2, 8*2=16 numbers: 10 to 25? 10 to 25 inclusive is 16 numbers, yes.

k=3, 24 numbers: 26 to 49? 49-26+1=24, yes.

The last number of the k-th ring is (2k+1)^2.

For k=0, center, last number 1 =1^2.

k=1, last number 9=3^2.

k=2, last number 25=5^2.

k=3, last number 49=7^2.

So yes, the last number of the k-th ring is (2k+1)^2.

The first number of the k-th ring: for k=1, first is 2.

After k-th ring, the last number is (2k+1)^2, so the next number starts the (k+1)-th ring.

The first number of the k-th ring: since after (k-1)-th ring ends at (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2, so first number is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=1: (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1^2 +1=2, yes.

k=2: (3)^2 +1=10, yes.

k=3:5^2+1=26, yes.

The ring has 8k numbers, as we saw.

Now, the position of each number.

I need to find the coordinates of a given number.

So, for number n, find which ring it's in.

Find the smallest k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

Since the last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

So, for a given n, find k where (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1 and ends at (2k+1)^2.

For example, n=1: (2*0+1)^2=1, so k=0? But k starts from 0 for center.

Define k as the ring index, starting from 0.

k=0: center, n=1.

k=1: n=2 to 9.

k=2: n=10 to 25.

So for n, find k such that if n=1, k=0.

Else, find smallest k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

Since for k>=1, (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

For n=1, it's separate.

But n=2026 is large, so k>=1.

So for n>=2, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Set m = ceil(sqrt(n)) or something.

Solve (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Set a = 2k-1, b=2k+1.

The inequality is a^2 < n <= b^2, with b=a+2.

Since b=a+2, and a odd, b odd.

So for given n, find smallest odd integer s such that s^2 >= n, but s=2k+1, so if s^2 >= n, and s odd.

But s^2 >= n, but the ring ends at s^2, starts at (s-2)^2 +1? Since previous ring ends at (s-2)^2.

Set s = ceil(sqrt(n)), but s must be odd.

Easier to compute sqrt(n), then find the odd integer around it.

For n=2026.

Compute sqrt(2026).

45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025=45^2, which is odd, and 2026>2025.

Now, (2k+1)^2 >= n.

For k, (2k+1)^2 >= n.

45^2=2025.

Is 45 odd? Yes, 45=2*22+1? 2*22=44, 44+1=45, yes.

So s=45, which is 2k+1=45, so k=22.

Now, check the inequality: ring k=22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

But n=2026 >2025, so it should be in the next ring.

k=22 ends at 2025, so ring k=23 starts at 2026.

First number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

For k=23, first number is (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Yes, exactly.

So n=2026 is the first number of ring k=23.

Now, each ring has a starting point and direction.

The rings start at different positions.

For ring k, it starts at which direction?

From the center, ring k=1 starts at (1,0), which is east.

Then moves north.

General pattern: for each ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) or something? Let's see.

For k=1: starts at (1,0)? But (1,0) is east, and we have n=2 there.

In our coordinate, x right, y down.

For ring k=1: numbers 2 to 9.

Positions:

2: (1,0)

3: (1,-1)  // north

4: (0,-1)  // west

5: (-1,-1) // west

6: (-1,0)  // south

7: (-1,1)  // south

8: (0,1)   // east

9: (1,1)   // east

Then ring k=2 starts at (2,1)? But earlier I thought (2,1):10.

After 9 at (1,1), move east to (2,1):10.

Then move north to (2,0):11? But (2,0) is north of (2,1).

y down, so north is decreasing y.

From (2,1) to (2,0): yes, north.

Then (2,-1):12? 

Then west to (1,-1): but (1,-1) is occupied by 3, so probably continues to (2,-1), then west to (1,-1)? But occupied.

Pattern: after finishing a ring, it moves east to start the next ring.

From the end of ring k, which is at (k,k) or something.

For ring k=1, ends at (1,1):9.

Then moves east to (2,1):10, start of ring k=2.

Then from (2,1), it moves north to (2,0):11, (2,-1):12, but how many steps?

Each side of the ring has length 2k.

For ring k, the side length is 2k.

For k=1, side length should be 2? But from 2 to 3 is one step, but actually each "side" has multiple numbers.

In ring k, it consists of four sides: east, north, west, south.

Each side has how many numbers? For k=1, east side: from 2 to ? but only 2 is on east? Let's see.

Typically, for ring k, the east side has numbers from start to start + (2k-1) or something.

General formula: for ring k, it starts at position (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1, -0) = (1,0), yes.

Then it moves north for how many steps? For k=1, it moves north to (1,-1):3, so one step.

But one step means two numbers? From start to next is one move, but adds one number? When it moves, it places a number at each step.

In the spiral, it moves to adjacent cell and places the number.

So for ring k, starting at (k, 1-k) ? Earlier I said (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k) since -(k-1)=1-k.

For k=1: (1,1-1)=(1,0), good.

Then it moves north (decreasing y) for (2k-1) steps? For k=1, moves north: from (1,0) to (1,-1): one step, places number 3.

But number of moves: it moves once, placing one number? But total numbers per side.

For ring k, each side has 2k numbers? But for k=1, total numbers 8, four sides, so 2 per side? But 2k=2, yes.

But each side has 2k numbers, but the starting point is shared, so actually the number of moves per side is 2k, but since the corner is shared, it might be different.

In terms of positions: for the east side, it moves north, but east side is vertical? Let's define.

Typically, for ring k:

- Start at (k, 1-k)  // bottom-right? In our case.

For k=1: (1,0)

Then it moves north (up) for (2k-1) steps? For k=1, moves north: to (1,-1), so one step, placing number 3? But after start, it moves north, so first move north places the second number of the side.

Perhaps the side includes the start.

For ring k, east side: from (k, 1-k) to (k, -k) ? For k=1: from (1,0) to (1,-1)? But that's only two points: (1,0) and (1,-1), numbers 2 and 3.

But 2 is start, 3 is after move north.

Then next side is west? No, after 3 at (1,-1), it moves west to (0,-1):4.

So north side? From (1,-1) to (0,-1), but that's west, but it's the top side.

Actually, after moving north to (1,-1), it then moves west for the north side.

So the sides are: first, east side: but east side is vertical? Perhaps better to think as directions.

Standard way: for ring k, it starts at (k, k-1) or something. Different conventions.

I recall that in such spirals, the position can be found by finding the layer and the offset.

Since n=2026 is the first number of ring k=23, and it starts at a specific position.

What is the starting position for ring k?

From earlier:

For k=1: starts at (1,0)

k=2: starts at (2,1)? Earlier (2,1):10

k=3: should start at (3,2)? Since after ring k=2 ends at (2,-2)? Let's see.

Ring k=2: starts at (2,1):10

Then moves north to (2,0):11, (2,-1):12, (2,-2):13? Since for k=2, side length should be 4? 2k=4 numbers per side.

From (2,1) move north: to (2,0):11, (2,-1):12, (2,-2):13. So three moves? Positions: start (2,1):10, then move north to (2,0):11, (2,-1):12, (2,-2):13. So that's four positions: y=1,0,-1,-2? From y=1 to y=-2, but that's a change of 3 in y, so 4 positions? y=1,0,-1,-2: yes, four points.

But each move changes y by 1, so from y=1 to y=-2, delta y=-3, so three moves, but four positions: start and three moves? When it moves, it places a number at the new position.

So from start position, it moves north (decreasing y) for (2k) steps? But for k=2, 2*2=4 steps? But it only moves three times? Contradiction.

After placing at start, it moves direction and places at each step.

For ring k, each side has exactly 2k numbers? But the corners are shared.

In ring k, total numbers 8k.

The ring goes from x=k to x=-k, y=k to y=-k, but not all, only the perimeter.

Specifically, for ring k, the min x is -k, max x is k, min y is -k, max y is k, but only the cells where |x|=k or |y|=k, but not both unless corner, but corners are included.

Actually, it's the set of points where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so points (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)? But that's 8 points, but in our spiral, for k=1, we have (1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1), which are exactly these 8 points: all with max(|x|,|y|)=1.

max(|x|,|y|)=1 means |x|<=1, |y|<=1, but max is 1, so not both |x|<1 and |y|<1, but since integers, it's all points where |x|=1 or |y|=1, but excluding (0,0), but (0,0) is center, so for ring k, it's all points with max(|x|,|y|)=k.

For k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, which includes (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1). But in our earlier assignment, we have exactly these: (1,0):2, (1,-1):3? But (1,-1) max(|1|,| -1|)=1, yes. But we have (0,-1):4, (-1,-1):5, etc., all covered.

For k=2: max(|x|,|y|)=2, so |x|=2 or |y|=2, but max is 2, so points where |x|<=2, |y|<=2, but max is 2, so not both |x|<2 and |y|<2, i.e., excludes interior points.

The points: x from -2 to 2, y from -2 to 2, but exclude where |x|<2 and |y|<2, i.e., exclude |x|<=1 and |y|<=1? max(|x|,|y|)=2 means that the larger of |x| and |y| is exactly 2, so either |x|=2 and |y|<=2, or |y|=2 and |x|<2? But when |x|=2, |y| can be 0,1,2, but max is 2, so yes.

Specifically, for |x|=2, y from -2 to 2: points (2,-2),(2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)

Similarly for |y|=2: (-2,2),(-1,2),(0,2),(1,2),(2,2) but (2,2) is shared.

Similarly for x=-2: (-2,-2),(-2,-1),(-2,0),(-2,1),(-2,2)

For y=-2: (-2,-2),(-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2)

But corners are counted multiple times, but in set, it's unique.

Total points: for each side, without corners, 3 points? For example, top side: y=2, x from -2 to 2, but excluding corners? But corners are included.

Standard: for a ring of size k, it has 4*(2k) - 4? Because each side has 2k+1 points? No.

The number of points: for max(|x|,|y|)=k, the number is 8k, as we know.

The positions are traversed in order.

Now, for ring k, it starts at (k, k-1)? For k=1: (1,1-1)=(1,0), good.

k=2: (2,2-1)=(2,1), which is where 10 is, good.

k=3: (3,3-1)=(3,2), should be 26.

Now, the direction: it starts by moving north? For k=1: from (1,0) move north to (1,-1)? But y down, so north is negative y.

From (1,0) to (1,-1): decreasing y.

But in k=1, it moved to (1,-1):3.

But north is decreasing y, yes.

Then after that, it moves west? To (0,-1):4.

West is decreasing x.

General sequence: for each ring, it starts at (k, k-1), then moves in direction: north, west, south, east? But in k=1: start (1,0), move north to (1,-1), then move west to (0,-1), then move south to (0,0)? But (0,0) is center, occupied. Mistake.

After (0,-1):4, it moves south? To (-1,-1)? But south is increasing y, so from (0,-1) to (0,0)? Occupied, no.

From (0,-1) it moved west to (-1,-1):5, which is west? x decreasing.

From (0,-1) to (-1,-1): same y, x decreases, so west.

Then from (-1,-1) move south to (-1,0):6, south (y increasing).

Then to (-1,1):7, south.

Then to (0,1):8, east (x increasing).

Then to (1,1):9, east.

So the directions in order: start, then north (for k=1, one move), but it moved north once, placing one number? After start, it moved north to place 3.

Then moved west to place 4 and 5? From (1,-1) to (0,-1):4, then to (-1,-1):5, so two moves west.

Then moved south to (-1,0):6, then to (-1,1):7, two moves south? But only to y=1.

Then moved east to (0,1):8, then to (1,1):9, two moves east? But k=1, should be symmetric.

For k=1, each side has two numbers? But east side: only (1,0) and (1,-1)? But (1,0) is start, (1,-1) is after north move.

Actually, the sides:

- North side: from (1,-1) to (-1,-1)? But that's west.

Better: the ring is traversed as:

- Move north: from (k,k-1) to (k,-k) ? For k=1: from (1,0) to (1,-1)? Only one step, but should be more.

The number of moves per direction.

For ring k, after starting, it moves north for (2k-1) steps? For k=1: 2*1-1=1 step, to (1,-1).

Then moves west for 2k steps? But 2k=2, to (0,-1) and (-1,-1)? From (1,-1) move west to (0,-1): first step, then to (-1,-1): second step. So yes, two steps.

Then moves south for 2k steps? To (-1,0) and (-1,1)? From (-1,-1) move south to (-1,0): first, then to (-1,1): second. Yes.

Then moves east for 2k steps? To (0,1) and (1,1)? From (-1,1) move east to (0,1): first, then to (1,1): second. But then it ends at (1,1), which is correct.

But for k=1, it worked, but notice that when it moves west, it goes from x=k to x=-k, but y fixed? In this case, from (1,-1) to (-1,-1), same y=-1.

Similarly for south, same x=-1, y from -1 to 1? From y=-1 to y=1, delta y=2, so two moves? Positions: start at (-1,-1), move south to (-1,0), then to (-1,1). So y increases from -1 to 1, but only two moves? From y=-1 to y=0: first move, y=0 to y=1: second move, so positions y=-1,-1? Start at (-1,-1), after first south move to (-1,0), after second to (-1,1). So positions covered: (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1). Three positions? But for k=1, only two numbers? No, numbers 5,6,7? At (-1,-1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,1):7. Three numbers.

But earlier I said for k=1, south side should have two numbers? But here it has three positions: (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1). But (-1,-1) is also the corner of west side.

Inconsistency.

In the traversal, the starting point is included, and corners are traversed once.

For ring k, the total displacement.

From start (k, k-1)

Then move north: direction (0,-1) (since y down, north is -y)

For k moves? But for k=1, it moved north once: from (1,0) to (1,-1), so delta y = -1.

But the north side should go to y=-k, which for k=1 is y=-1, so from y=k-1=0 to y=-k=-1, so delta y = -1, so one step.

Then move west: direction (-1,0), from (1,-1) to (-1,-1)? Delta x = -2, so two steps: to (0,-1) and (-1,-1).

But the x goes from k=1 to -k=-1, delta x=-2, so number of moves is |delta x| = 2.

Similarly, then move south: direction (0,1), from (-1,-1) to (-1,1)? Delta y=2, so two moves: to (-1,0) and (-1,1).

Then move east: direction (1,0), from (-1,1) to (1,1)? Delta x=2, so two moves: to (0,1) and (1,1).

But for k=1, it worked: positions: start (1,0), north to (1,-1), west to (0,-1), (-1,-1), south to (-1,0), (-1,1), east to (0,1), (1,1). Total 8 positions, good.

Now for k=2: start at (2,2-1)=(2,1)

Move north: direction (0,-1), delta y from y=1 to y=-2? Since max y should be -k? For ring k=2, min y is -2, max y is 2? But in traversal.

The north side should go to y=-k = -2.

Start at y=k-1=1, end at y=-k=-2, delta y = -3? So number of moves: |delta y| = 3.

Similarly, from x=2 to x=-2 for west, delta x=-4, moves=4? But total moves should sum to 8k=16 for k=2.

Directions: north, west, south, east.

Number of moves per direction: for north and south, it's vertical, for west and east horizontal.

From start (k, k-1)

Move north: to (k, -k) ? From y=k-1 to y=-k, delta y = - (2k-1) ? For k=2, delta y=1 to -2, delta y=-3, so 3 moves.

Then move west: from (k,-k) to (-k,-k)? From x=k to x=-k, delta x= -2k, so 2k moves? For k=2, delta x=2 to -2, delta x=-4, 4 moves.

Then move south: from (-k,-k) to (-k,k)? From y=-k to y=k, delta y=2k, so 2k moves? For k=2, from y=-2 to y=2? But k=2, y=k=2, but earlier south side should be at x=-k.

From (-k,-k) to (-k,k), delta y=2k, so 2k moves.

But for k=2, delta y=4? From y=-2 to y=2, delta y=4, so 4 moves.

Then move east: from (-k,k) to (k,k)? From x=-k to x=k, delta x=2k, so 2k moves.

Total moves: north: 2k-1? For k=2, north moves:3, which is 2*2 -1=3.

West moves: 2k? 4.

South moves: 2k? 4.

East moves: 2k? 4.

Total moves: 3+4+4+4=15, but should be 16? Moves, but each move places one number, but the start position also has a number, so total numbers = moves +1? In this case, for ring k, it has 8k numbers, but if we have start and then moves, total positions = 1 + number of moves.

Number of moves should be 8k -1.

For k=2, 16-1=15 moves, and 3+4+4+4=15, yes.

For k=1: north moves:2*1-1=1, west:2*1=2, south:2*1=2, east:2*1=2, total moves 1+2+2+2=7, plus start, total 8 numbers, good.

Now, the directions:

- Start at (k, k-1)

- Move north (dy = -1) for (2k-1) steps

- Then move west (dx = -1) for (2k) steps

- Then move south (dy = +1) for (2k) steps

- Then move east (dx = +1) for (2k) steps? But for k=1, east moves:2, but after south, it moves east to (0,1) and (1,1), which is correct.

But for k=2, after south, it moves east for 2k=4 steps.

Now, after moving south, it ends at (-k,k)? After south moves: start from (-k,-k), move south (dy=+1) for 2k steps: each step dy=+1, so after m steps, y = -k + m.

After 2k steps, y = -k + 2k = k.

So ends at (-k,k).

Then move east (dx=+1) for 2k steps: from x=-k to x=-k + 2k = k, so ends at (k,k).

But for ring k, it should end at (k,k), which is correct, and for next ring, it starts at (k+1, (k+1)-1) = (k+1,k), which is adjacent to (k,k), and since it moves east, from (k,k) to (k+1,k)? But (k+1,k) is east of (k,k), yes, so it can move directly to start next ring.

Perfect.

Now for n=2026, which is the first number of ring k=23.

So it is at the start position: (k, k-1) = (23, 23-1) = (23,22)

k=23, so (23, 22)

Now, I need to find its eight neighbors.

The eight neighbors are the eight adjacent cells: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.

In terms of coordinates, for a cell (x,y), neighbors are:

- N: (x, y-1)

- S: (x, y+1)

- E: (x+1, y)

- W: (x-1, y)

- NE: (x+1, y-1)

- NW: (x-1, y-1)

- SE: (x+1, y+1)

- SW: (x-1, y+1)

Since it's a grid, and no diagonal neighbors mentioned, but the problem says "all 8 neighbors", so including diagonals.

In grid terms, eight neighbors mean all adjacent cells, including diagonals.

Now, for the cell at (23,22), its neighbors are:

List them:

N: (23,22-1)=(23,21)

S: (23,22+1)=(23,23)

E: (23+1,22)=(24,22)

W: (23-1,22)=(22,22)

NE: (23+1,22-1)=(24,21)

NW: (23-1,22-1)=(22,21)

SE: (23+1,22+1)=(24,23)

SW: (23-1,22+1)=(22,23)

So the eight neighbors are:

(23,21), (23,23), (24,22), (22,22), (24,21), (22,21), (24,23), (22,23)

Now, I need to find what numbers are at these positions, and sum them up.

But these positions may be in different rings, so I need to find for each coordinate, which number is there.

Since the spiral fills the grid sequentially, each cell has a unique number, but I need to compute the number for a given coordinate.

So, I need a function that maps (x,y) to the number n.

Since I know the ring for each cell, and then the position within the ring.

For a given coordinate (x,y), first find which ring it is in.

The ring k is given by k = max(|x|, |y|)

Because as we saw earlier, for a cell, k = max(|x|, |y|), and it belongs to ring k.

For example, (23,22): max(|23|,|22|)=23, so ring k=23.

But our n=2026 is at (23,22), which is ring k=23, and it's the start, so should be correct.

Now, for other neighbors:

Look at the neighbors:

(23,21): max(|23|,|21|)=23, same ring.

(23,23): max(23,23)=23, same.

(24,22): max(24,22)=24, so ring k=24.

(22,22): max(22,22)=22, ring k=22.

(24,21): max(24,21)=24, ring k=24.

(22,21): max(22,21)=22, ring k=22.

(24,23): max(24,23)=24, ring k=24.

(22,23): max(22,23)=23? |22|=22, |23|=23, max=23, so ring k=23.

So, neighbors are in rings k=22,23,24.

Specifically:

- In ring 22: (22,22), (22,21)

- In ring 23: (23,21), (23,23), (22,23) — and also (23,22) but that's the center itself, not neighbor.

The neighbors are: (22,21), (22,22), (22,23), (23,21), (23,23), (24,21), (24,22), (24,23)

By k:

- k=22: (22,21), (22,22)

- k=23: (23,21), (23,23), (22,23) — (22,23): max(|22|,|23|)=23, yes.

- k=24: (24,21), (24,22), (24,23)

Now, for each, I need to find the number at that position in its ring.

So, for a cell in ring k, I need to find its position relative to the ring traversal.

The traversal starts at (k, k-1), and moves in order: north, west, south, east, with given number of moves.

But since we have the coordinate, we can find which side it's on and the offset.

Now, for ring k, the start number is s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

Then, the traversal:

- Start at (k, k-1), number s_k

- Then move north for (2k-1) steps: each step dy=-1, dx=0

- Then move west for (2k) steps: dx=-1, dy=0

- Then move south for (2k) steps: dy=+1, dx=0

- Then move east for (2k) steps: dx=+1, dy=0

The numbers are assigned sequentially as we traverse.

Now, for a given (x,y) in ring k, we need to find where it is in this traversal path.

Now, since the ring is symmetric, we can determine which side it's on based on the position.

Specifically, the ring consists of four sides:

1. Top side: where y = -k? But y increases down, so top is min y.

Actually, since y increases down, the "north" side is where y is minimized, i.e., y = -k.

Similarly, south side y = k.

East side x = k.

West side x = -k.

But each side includes the corners.

For example, for ring k, the sides:

- East side: x = k, and y from -k to k? But no, only the perimeter.

Specifically:

- The north side: y = -k, and x from -k to k? But for north side, in traversal, it's when moving north, but moving north is only on the east side? Confusion.

In the traversal, when moving north, it's along the east side? For example, k=1: moving north from (1,0) to (1,-1), so on the line x=k=1, y from k-1 down to -k? y from 0 to -1.

So for the east side, but only the vertical part? But in this case, it's the right side, x=k.

In k=1, east side is x=1, y from -1 to 1? But in traversal, we only covered y=0 and y=-1? But y=1 is covered later.

In the traversal, the entire east side is not covered in one go.

For the east side, which is x=k, y from -k to k, but in the traversal, it is covered in two parts: first, when moving north, from (k,k-1) to (k,-k), so y from k-1 down to -k.

Then later, when moving east, from (-k,k) to (k,k), but that's at y=k.

So the east side is covered: the top part when moving north (for y from -k to k-1), and the bottom part when moving east (at y=k).

Similarly for other sides.

To find the exact position, we need to see in which segment the point is.

For a point (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|)=k.

Now, depending on which side it's on.

The four sides:

- If |x| = k and |y| < k, then it's on the east or west side, depending on sign of x.

Specifically, if x = k, then east side; if x = -k, then west side.

- If |y| = k and |x| < k, then north or south side, depending on sign of y.

But since y increases down, north is y negative, south is y positive.

Specifically, if y = -k, north side; if y = k, south side.

- The corners: where |x|=k and |y|=k, are included in both, but we can assign to one side, but in traversal they are covered.

In the traversal path, each corner is visited once, so we can include them in the appropriate segment.

For example, corner (k,-k): when moving north, since it's the end of north move.

Similarly, (-k,-k): end of west move.

(-k,k): end of south move? For k=1: (-1,1) is end of south move? In k=1, after west move to (-1,-1), then south to (-1,0), (-1,1), so (-1,1) is end of south move.

Then (k,k)=(1,1) end of east move.

So corners: (k,-k) is end of north segment.

(-k,-k) is end of west segment.

(-k,k) is end of south segment.

(k,k) is end of east segment.

Now, for a point on the side, but not corner.

To find the number, we can compute the distance along the path from the start.

The start is at (k,k-1)

Then the path goes: north to (k,-k), then west to (-k,-k), then south to (-k,k), then east to (k,k).

The total path length: from start to end.

The cumulative steps.

The start number is s_k.

Then, after moving north (2k-1) steps, the number at (k,-k) is s_k + (2k-1) ? Since each move places one number, so after m moves, the number is s_k + m.

At start: number s_k.

After first move: number s_k +1

After second move: s_k +2, etc.

So after t moves, the number is s_k + t.

But t is the number of moves from start, so the position after t moves.

But for a point, we need to find how many moves from start to that point.

Since the path is linear, we can compute the Manhattan distance along the path.

Now, for a given (x,y), we can compute which segment it is in and its offset.

Now, let's define the segments.

Segment 1: moving north from (k,k-1) to (k,-k)

Direction: dy=-1, dx=0.

Start point: (k,k-1)

End point: (k,-k)

Number of moves: (2k-1), as before.

The y-coordinate decreases from k-1 to -k.

The y-values: from y=k-1 down to y=-k.

The number of points: (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = k-1 +k +1=2k? But earlier we have 2k positions? For example k=1: y from 0 to -1, points y=0,-1, two points, which is 2k? 2*1=2, yes.

But in moves: from start to end, delta y = -k - (k-1) = -k -k +1 = -2k+1? Absolute delta y = 2k-1, and since each move changes y by 1, number of moves is |delta y| = 2k-1.

But number of positions: from y=k-1 to y=-k, inclusive, difference in y is (k-1) - (-k) = 2k-1, but since inclusive, number of integers is (2k-1) +1 = 2k? Contradiction.

Example k=1: y from 0 to -1, positions: y=0, y=-1, two positions. Delta y = -1 -0 = -1, |delta|=1, but number of positions is 2.

The start position is included, and after each move, a new position.

So for segment 1: starts at (k,k-1), then moves north (2k-1) times, each to a new position, so total positions in this segment: 1 + (2k-1) = 2k.

Similarly for others.

For segment 1: positions from index 0 to 2k-1? Total 2k positions.

The y-coordinate: starts at y=k-1, ends at y=-k.

The y decreases by 1 each move.

So after t moves in this segment, y = (k-1) - t

And x = k

Now, t ranges from 0 to 2k-1, where t=0 is start, t=2k-1 is end.

For example k=1: t=0: y=1-1=0? k=1, y=k-1=0, x=1

t=1: y=0-1=-1, x=1

t=2? But 2k-1=1, so t=0 and t=1? But 2k=2 positions, t from 0 to 1? t=0: first position, t=1: after one move.

But t=1 is the last, since only two positions.

Number of moves in segment is 2k-1? For k=1, moves=1, positions=2.

The position index within segment: let p be the step from start, p=0 at start, p=1 after first move, etc., up to p=2k-1? For k=1, p=0 and p=1? But p=1 is after one move.

The y-coordinate: y = (k-1) - p

For p=0, y=k-1

p=1, y=k-2

...

p=m, y=k-1-m

Set equal to -k: k-1-m = -k => m=2k-1, yes.

So for a point on this segment, x=k, and y = k-1 - p for some p, 0<=p<=2k-1

Thus p = (k-1) - y

Since y <= k-1 and y >= -k, and p >=0, p = (k-1) - y

Then the number at this point is s_k + p, because at start p=0, number s_k, after p moves, number s_k + p.

Is that correct? After p moves, the number is s_k + p, and since each move places a number, yes.

For example k=1, segment 1: points (1,0): p= (1-1)-0=0, number s_k +0= (2*1-1)^2 +1 +0=1^2 +1=2, correct.

(1,-1): p=(1-1)-(-1)=0+1=1, number 2+1=3, correct.

Now, next segment: moving west from (k,-k) to (-k,-k)

Start point: (k,-k), which is the end of previous segment, number s_k + (2k-1) ? Since after 2k-1 moves? Previous segment had 2k-1 moves? No.

In segment 1, we have positions from p=0 to p=2k-1, so the last position has index p=2k-1, number s_k + (2k-1)

Now, segment 2: moving west, start at (k,-k), number s_k + (2k-1) ? But s_k + (2k-1) is the number at (k,-k), which is the start of this segment.

Then it moves west for 2k steps? Number of moves is 2k, so number of positions: 1 + 2k = 2k+1? But should be consistent.

Start at (k,-k), then move west to (k-1,-k), (k-2,-k), ..., down to (-k,-k)

Delta x from k to -k, delta x = -2k, so number of moves: 2k? Since each move dx=-1.

Positions: start at x=k, then after first move x=k-1, ..., after m moves x=k-m.

Set x=k-m = -k, so m=2k.

So positions: x=k, k-1, ..., -k, which is 2k+1 positions? From k to -k inclusive, number of integers: k - (-k) +1 = 2k+1.

But earlier for segment 1, we had 2k positions, now 2k+1? But total should be 8k.

Problem.

For k=1: segment 1: 2 positions: (1,0),(1,-1)

Segment 2: moving west from (1,-1) to (-1,-1)? So positions: (1,-1), then move west to (0,-1), then to (-1,-1). So three positions: (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)

But (1,-1) is already included in segment 1? So it's overlapping.

In the traversal, the start of segment 2 is the same as end of segment 1.

So when we start segment 2, we are at (k,-k), which is already occupied, so we don't place a new number there; we start moving from there.

In terms of numbering: at the end of segment 1, we are at (k,-k) with number, say, n1.

Then we start moving west: the first move is to the next cell, say (k-1,-k), and place number n1 +1.

So the start position of segment 2 is not assigned a new number; it was already assigned in segment 1.

So for segment 2, we start moving from (k,-k), and move to (k-1,-k), placing the next number.

So the positions in segment 2 are from (k-1,-k) to (-k,-k), inclusive? For k=1: from (0,-1) to (-1,-1)? But that's two positions? But we have three points: after move to (0,-1): number 4, then to (-1,-1):5. So positions (0,-1) and (-1,-1), two positions.

But earlier I listed three points, but (1,-1) is in segment 1.

So segment 2 has positions: (k-1,-k), (k-2,-k), ..., (-k,-k)

x from k-1 down to -k, so number of positions: (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1=2k.

Delta x = (k-1) - (-k) = 2k-1, so number of integers: 2k.

For example k=1: x from 1-1=0 to -1, positions x=0,-1? But only two, but should be 2k=2, yes. Numbers: at (0,-1):4, (-1,-1):5.

The start is (k-1,-k), end is (-k,-k).

The x-coordinate decreases from k-1 to -k.

After q moves in this segment, but since we start moving from (k,-k), but we don't place number there; we move to (k-1,-k) and place first number of segment.

So for segment 2, the first position is (k-1,-k), with number s_k + (number of moves so far) +1? 

At the end of segment 1, we are at (k,-k) with number s_k + (2k -1) ? Since p from 0 to 2k-1, so last number is s_k + (2k-1)

Then, we move to (k-1,-k) and place the next number: s_k + 2k

Then to (k-2,-k): s_k + 2k +1

...

To (-k,-k): after how many moves? From x=k-1 to x=-k, delta x = - (2k-1)? From k-1 to -k, difference in x is -k - (k-1) = -2k+1, so |delta x|=2k-1, so number of moves: 2k-1? But earlier I said 2k positions.

Positions: x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k.

The sequence: x starts at k-1, ends at -k.

The values: k-1, k-2, ..., -k.

Number of terms: from k-1 down to -k, step -1.

Number: (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = k-1 +k +1=2k.

The index: let q be the step in this segment, q=0 at first position (k-1,-k), q=1 at next, etc.

After q moves? But since we start at first position, q=0 corresponds to no move yet, but we are at (k-1,-k).

x = (k-1) - q

Set x = (k-1) - q

When q=0, x=k-1

q=1, x=k-2

...

q=m, x=k-1-m

Set equal to -k: k-1-m = -k => m=2k-1

So q from 0 to 2k-1

Then the number at this point: since the first number of segment 2 is s_k + 2k ? Earlier for k=1: s_k=2, first number of seg2 is at (0,-1):4, s_k + 2k =2+2=4, yes.

In general, after segment 1, we have placed 2k numbers? Segment 1 has 2k positions, numbers from s_k to s_k + (2k -1)

Then segment 2 starts, first number is s_k + 2k

Then at position q, number = (s_k + 2k) + q

For q=0: s_k + 2k

q=1: s_k + 2k +1

...

q=2k-1: s_k + 2k + (2k-1) = s_k + 4k -1

For k=1: q=0:4, q=1:5, good.

Now, segment 3: moving south from (-k,-k) to (-k,k)

Start at (-k,-k), which is end of segment 2, number s_k + 4k -1 ? For k=1: s_k +4*1 -1=2+4-1=5, which is at (-1,-1), correct.

Then move south: dy=+1, dx=0.

First move to (-k,-k+1)? Place number s_k + 4k

Then to (-k,-k+2), etc., up to (-k,k)

y from -k to k, delta y=2k, so number of moves: 2k? Positions: start at (-k,-k), but we don't place new number; we move to next.

So positions: (-k, -k+1), (-k, -k+2), ..., (-k,k)

y from -k+1 to k? For k=1: y from -1+1=0 to 1? Positions (-1,0), (-1,1)

But earlier we have (-1,0):6, (-1,1):7

So two positions for k=1.

General: y starts at -k+1? First position is (-k, -k+1)? After first move.

y from -k+1 to k.

Number of positions: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

Same as before.

Index r: from 0 to 2k-1

y = (-k+1) + r ? When r=0, y=-k+1

r=1, y=-k+2

...

r=m, y=-k+1+m

Set to k: -k+1+m=k => m=2k-1

So r=0 to 2k-1, y= -k+1 + r

Number: first number is s_k + 4k ? Since previous last was s_k +4k-1, so next is s_k +4k

For k=1: s_k+4k=2+4=6, at (-1,0), good.

Then at r, number = (s_k + 4k) + r

For r=0: s_k+4k, r=1: s_k+4k+1, ..., r=2k-1: s_k+4k +2k-1 = s_k +6k-1

k=1: r=0:6, r=1:7, good.

Now segment 4: moving east from (-k,k) to (k,k)

Start at (-k,k), end of segment 3, number s_k +6k -1? k=1:2+6-1=7, at (-1,1), good.

Move east: dx=+1, dy=0.

First move to (-k+1,k), place number s_k +6k

Then to (-k+2,k), ..., to (k,k)

x from -k+1 to k.

Number of positions: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

Index s: from 0 to 2k-1

x = (-k+1) + s

s=0: x=-k+1

s=1: x=-k+2

...

s=2k-1: x=-k+1 +2k-1=k

Number: first number s_k +6k

At s, number = (s_k +6k) + s

Last number: s_k +6k + (2k-1) = s_k +8k -1

For k=1: s_k+8k-1=2+8-1=9, at (1,1), good.

Total numbers: from s_k to s_k +8k -1, which is 8k numbers, correct.

Now, to summarize for a point (x,y) in ring k:

First, s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

Now, determine which segment:

- If x = k and y >= -k and y <= k-1: then in segment 1 (north move)

Then p = (k-1) - y

Number = s_k + p

- Else if y = -k and x <= k-1 and x >= -k: but since |x|<=k, and y=-k, but in this case, if x=k, it's corner, already in segment 1.

For segment 2: west move, which is when y = -k, and x < k? But since |x|<=k, and y=-k, and not the start corner.

Actually, segment 2: positions with y = -k, and x from k-1 down to -k.

x <= k-1 and x >= -k, and y=-k.

Similarly for others.

To avoid confusion, we can compute based on the conditions.

Since we have the coordinate, we can compute the relative position.

The segments are:

1. East side, top part: x=k, y from -k to k-1 (but in our case, y from k-1 down to -k)

But since it's a line, we can use the formula.

Similarly.

For segment 2: west side, y=-k, x from k-1 down to -k? x from -k to k-1, but decreasing.

But in terms of x, decreasing.

Now for our neighbors, we can compute each one.

But since we need for different k, and different segments.

Now back to our neighbors for (23,22), which is ring k=23, and since x=23=k, y=22=k-1? k=23, k-1=22, yes, so it is exactly the start point, segment 1, p=0.

But we need its neighbors, not itself.

So the neighbors are as listed.

Now let's list each neighbor and find its number.

First, neighbors in ring k=23:

- (23,21): x=23=k, y=21

k=23, k-1=22, so y=21 < k-1=22? And y > -k? -23? yes.

Since x=k, and y <= k-1, and y >= -k, so in segment 1.

p = (k-1) - y = 22 - 21 =1

s_k = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026

Number = s_k + p = 2026 + 1 = 2027

Is that right? s_k is the start, which is 2026 at (23,22), then moving north to (23,21), so yes, should be next number 2027.

But is (23,21) adjacent? x same, y=21 vs 22, so yes, north neighbor? Since y down, north is decreasing y, so from (23,22) to (23,21) is north, yes.

Next neighbor in ring 23: (23,23)

x=23=k, y=23

But k=23, so y=k.

Now, segment 1 has y from k-1 down to -k, so y=k is not in segment 1.

Where is it? Probably in segment 4, the east move at bottom.

Segment 4: moving east at y=k.

x from -k+1 to k, y=k.

In this case, x=k, y=k, which is the corner.

Segment 4: positions with y=k, x from -k+1 to k.

So for (23,23): x=23=k, y=23=k, so yes, in segment 4.

Now, in segment 4: s from 0 to 2k-1, x = (-k+1) + s

So s = x - (-k+1) = x + k -1

Here x=23, k=23, s=23+23-1=45

Now, number = (s_k + 6k) + s

s_k=2026, k=23

s_k +6k =2026 + 6*23=2026 + 138=2164

Then number=2164 + s =2164 +45=2209

Since it's the end point, last number of ring.

Last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2 = (46+1)^2? 2k+1=46+1=47? k=23, 2k+1=46+1=47? 2*23+1=46+1=47, yes, 47^2=2209, yes.

Now, next neighbor in ring 23: (22,23)

x=22, y=23=k

So |x|=22<23=k? |y|=23=k, so since |y|=k and |x|<k? |x|=22<23, yes, so south side, segment 3? Segment 3 is moving south, which is at x=-k, y from -k+1 to k.

But here x=22, not -23.

So not segment 3.

Segment 4 is east move at y=k, but that's for x increasing.

Here x=22, y=k=23.

Since |y|=k, and y=k>0, so south side.

In traversal, south side is covered in segment 3: moving south at x=-k.

But here x=22, which is not -k=-23.

So must be in segment 4? Segment 4 is y=k, x from -k+1 to k.

x=22, which is between -23+1=-22 and 23? -22 to 23, yes, 22 is within.

And y=k=23, so yes, in segment 4.

So same as above.

x=22, y=23, k=23

In segment 4: s = x - (-k +1) = x + k -1 =22 +23 -1=44

Number = (s_k +6k) + s =2164 +44=2208

s_k +6k=2026+138=2164, yes.

2164+44=2208.

Since last number is 2209 at (23,23), so previous is 2208 at (22,23), yes.

Now, next neighbors: in ring k=22.

First, (22,21): max(|22|,|21|)=22, so k=22.

s_k = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

Now, position: x=22=k, y=21

k-1=21, so y=21=k-1? k=22, k-1=21, so y=21.

Is it the start point? Start of ring k=22 is (k,k-1)=(22,21), yes!

So same as our original point but for k=22.

So it is the start of ring 22, so number s_k=1850

But is it? s_k=1850, and it's the first number.

Now, next neighbor: (22,22)

x=22, y=22

k=22, so max(|x|,|y|)=22.

Now, x=k=22, y=22=k.

So similar to before, in segment 4, since y=k, x=k.

So corner.

In segment 4: s = x - (-k +1) =22 - (-22 +1) =22 - (-21)=22+21=43? Earlier formula s = x + k -1

x=22, k=22, s=22+22-1=43

Number = (s_k +6k) + s

s_k=1850, 6k=6*22=132, so s_k+6k=1850+132=1982

Then number=1982 +43=2025

But last number of ring k=22 is (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, yes, at (22,22)? Since end of east move at (k,k)=(22,22), yes.

Now, neighbors in ring k=24.

First, (24,21): max(|24|,|21|)=24, so k=24.

s_k = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Now, position: x=24=k, y=21

k-1=23? k=24, k-1=23.

y=21 <23? And y> -24? yes.

So in segment 1.

p = (k-1) - y =23 -21=2

Number = s_k + p =2210 +2=2212

s_k=2210, p=2, so 2212.

Now, (24,22): x=24=k, y=22

k-1=23, y=22<23? yes.

So segment 1.

p=(k-1)-y=23-22=1

Number=s_k + p=2210+1=2211

Now, (24,23): x=24=k, y=23

k=24, k-1=23, so y=23=k-1? So it is the start point of ring k=24.

Start is (k,k-1)=(24,23), so number s_k=2210

But y=23, which is k-1=23, yes.

So number is s_k=2210

Now, we have all neighbors.

List them:

From ring 23:

- (23,21): 2027

- (23,23): 2209

- (22,23): 2208

From ring 22:

- (22,21): 1850

- (22,22): 2025

From ring 24:

- (24,21): 2212

- (24,22): 2211

- (24,23): 2210

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers:

2027, 2209, 2208, 1850, 2025, 2212, 2211, 2210

Now sum.

Add step by step.

First, group them.

Notice that some are consecutive.

For example, in ring 24: 2210,2211,2212

Sum: 2210+2211=4421, plus 2212=6633

In ring 23: 2027,2208,2209

2027 + 2208 = 4235, plus 2209=6444? 4235+2209.

4235+2200=6435, plus 9=6444.

Now ring 22: 1850,2025

1850+2025=3875

Now sum all: 6633 (ring24) + 6444 (ring23) + 3875 (ring22)

First, 6633 + 6444.

6633+6000=12633, plus 444=12633+400=13033, plus 44=13077? Better: 6633+6444.

6000+6000=12000, 633+444=1077? 633+400=1033, +44=1077? 633+44=677? No.

633 + 444: 600+400=1000, 33+44=77, total 1077.

So 12000+1077=13077.

Now plus ring22: 3875.

13077 + 3875.

13000+3800=16800, 77+75=152, total 16800+152=16952.

Compute: 13077 + 3875.

77+75=152, carry 1? 13077 + 3875.

Add: 7+5=12, write 2 carry 1.

7+7=14, plus carry 1=15, write 5 carry 1.

0+8=8, plus carry 1=9.

3+3=6.

1+0=1? Positions: 13077 has digits 1,3,0,7,7

3875: 0,3,8,7,5? Better align:

  13077

+  3875

------

Start from right: 7+5=12, write 2, carry 1.

7+7=14, plus carry 1=15, write 5, carry 1.

0+8=8, plus carry 1=9.

3+3=6.

1+0=1.

So 16952.

But is that correct? Let me verify with another way.

Notice that the neighbors include points that might be sequential, but anyway.

List all numbers again:

Ring22: 1850, 2025

Ring23: 2027, 2208, 2209

Ring24: 2210, 2211, 2212

Sum: 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Add sequentially.

First, 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Then +2027 = 3875 + 2000 = 5875, +27=5902? 3875+2027.

3875+2000=5875, +27=5902.

Then +2208 = 5902 + 2200 = 8102, +8=8110? 5902+2208.

5900+2200=8100, 2+8=10, total 8110.

Then +2209 = 8110 + 2209 = 8110 + 2200 = 10310, +9=10319.

Then +2210 = 10319 + 2210 = 10319 + 2000 = 12319, +210=12529? Better: 10319 + 2210 = 10319 + 2000 = 12319, +210=12529.

10319 + 2210: 19+10=29, 31+21=52? Align:

  10319

+  2210

------

9+0=9

1+1=2

3+2=5

0+2=2

1+0=1? 12529? But earlier I had 12529, but should be more.

10319 + 2210: 10000+2000=12000, 319+210=529, total 12529, yes.

Then +2211 = 12529 + 2211 = 12529 + 2000 = 14529, +211=14740? 14529+211=14529+200=14729, +11=14740? 

12529 + 2211: 29+11=40, carry 4? Better: 12529 + 2211.

9+1=10, write 0 carry 1.

2+1=3, plus carry 1=4? Digits: units:9+1=10, write 0 carry 1.

Tens:2+1=3, plus carry 1=4.

Hundreds:5+2=7.

Thousands:2+2=4.

Ten thousands:1+0=1? 12529 is 1,2,5,2,9? 1*10000 + 2*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 9? Standard: 12529 means 1*10000 + 2*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 9.

2211: 2*1000 + 2*100 + 1*10 + 1.

So add: thousands: 2+2=4? But 12529 has 2 thousands? 12000 is 12 thousands? Confusion.

12529: 12000 + 529? Better: 12529 + 2211.

12529 + 2000 = 14529

14529 + 211 = 14529 + 200 = 14729, +11=14740.

Yes.

Then +2212 = 14740 + 2212 = 14740 + 2000 = 16740, +212=16952.

Same as before.

So sum is 16952.

But is this the sum of neighbors? We have eight neighbors, and we summed eight numbers: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

But earlier I listed: for ring22: (22,21):1850, (22,22):2025

Ring23: (23,21):2027, (23,23):2209, (22,23):2208

Ring24: (24,21):2212, (24,22):2211, (24,23):2210

All covered.

Now sum is 16952.

But let me confirm if these are indeed neighbors.

Original point: (23,22)

Neighbors:

N: (23,21) → yes, ring23, 2027

S: (23,23) → ring23, 2209

E: (24,22) → ring24, 2211

W: (22,22) → ring22, 2025

NE: (24,21) → ring24, 2212

NW: (22,21) → ring22, 1850

SE: (24,23) → ring24, 2210

SW: (22,23) → ring23, 2208

All match.

Now sum is 16952.

But is this correct? Let me see if it makes sense.

Notice that for the original point, it's at the start of ring, so neighbors include the end of previous ring, start of next, etc.

In this case, (22,22) is the end of ring22, which is 2025.

(24,23) is the start of ring24, 2210.

(22,21) is the start of ring22, 1850.

(24,22) is in ring24, segment1, p=1, so second number.

(23,21) is north neighbor, next number in same ring.

(22,23) is west neighbor? Original is (23,22), west is (22,22)? But (22,23) is southwest.

Anyway, we have the numbers.

Perhaps compute sum directly.

Since we have the coordinates, and we computed correctly.

Another way to verify: for a smaller number.

For example, take the center, but center has neighbors, but not similar.

Take number 2, which is at (1,0), ring k=1.

Neighbors: eight neighbors.

First, (1,0): number 2.

Neighbors:

N: (1,-1) → number 3

S: (1,1) → number 9? In our earlier, (1,1):9

E: (2,0) → ring k=2? max(|2|,|0|)=2, so k=2. Start is (2,1):10? But (2,0) should be what.

For k=2, s_k=(4-1)^2 +1=9+1=10? Earlier ring2 starts at (2,1):10.

Now (2,0): x=2=k, y=0, k=2, k-1=1, so y=0<1? yes, segment1.

p=(k-1)-y=1-0=1

Number=s_k + p=10+1=11

W: (0,0) → but (0,0) is center, number 1? But is it neighbor? Yes.

In the grid, neighbors of 2: which is at (1,0)

Adjacent cells: 

N: (1,-1):3

S: (1,1):9? In our assignment, (1,1):9

E: (2,0): should be 10? But earlier we have 11? Mistake.

In the spiral, after 9 at (1,1), next is 10 at (2,1)? Then 11 at (2,0)? Yes.

But (2,0) is east of (1,0)? x increases, so (2,0) is east of (1,0), yes.

But number at (2,0) is 11? But is there a cell at (2,0)? Yes.

W: (0,0):1

NE: (2,-1): should be? (2,-1): for k=2, x=2,y=-1, segment1? p=(k-1)-y=1-(-1)=1+1=2? Number=10+2=12

NW: (0,-1):4? Since (0,-1):4

SE: (2,1):10? (2,1) is south-east? From (1,0), se is (2,1), which is (x+1,y+1)=(2,1), number 10

SW: (0,1):8? (0,1):8

So neighbors: N:3, S:9, E:11? (2,0):11, W:1, NE:12? (2,-1):12, NW:4? (0,-1):4, SE:10? (2,1):10, SW:8? (0,1):8

So numbers: 3,9,11,1,12,4,10,8

Sum: let's compute: 3+9=12, +11=23, +1=24, +12=36, +4=40, +10=50, +8=58.

Now, according to our method, for n=2, but we need neighbors of n=2.

But in this case, the neighbors are in different rings: k=0,1,2.

(0,0):k=0, number1

(0,-1):k=1, number4

(0,1):k=1, number8

(1,-1):k=1, number3

(1,1):k=1, number9

(2,-1):k=2, number12

(2,0):k=2, number11

(2,1):k=2, number10

Same as above.

Sum=58.

Now, if we compute similarly, but for comparison.

But for our problem, we have sum 16952 for n=2026.

Now, is there a pattern or simpler way?

Notice that for a point on the spiral, but in this case, since it's a corner point, start of ring.

The neighbors form a 3x3 grid minus center.

The numbers around it.

Since we have the coordinates, and we computed, and for small case it worked, probably correct.

But in our sum for n=2026, we have 16952.

Now, let me confirm the last number.

For example, (22,22) is end of ring22, (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, yes.

(24,23) is start of ring24, (2*24-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210, yes.

(23,21) is next to start: since start is (23,22):2026, north is (23,21):2027, yes.

(24,22): in ring24, segment1, p=(24-1)-22=23-22=1, number=2210+1=2211, yes.

All seem correct.

Sum is 16952.

But the problem asks for sum of all 8 neighbors, and we have eight numbers summing to 16952.

Now, perhaps box the answer.

But let me write it down.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me add them again to confirm.

List:

1850 (NW)

2025 (W)  // (22,22)

2027 (N)  // (23,21)

2208 (SW) // (22,23)

2209 (S)  // (23,23)

2210 (SE) // (24,23)

2211 (E)  // (24,22)

2212 (NE) // (24,21)

Now add:

Group: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

2027 + 2208 = 4235? 2000+2200=4200, 27+8=35, total 4235

2209 + 2210 = 4419

2211 + 2212 = 4423

Now sum these: 3875, 4235, 4419, 4423

First, 3875 + 4235 = 3875 + 4000 = 7875, +235=8110? 7875+235=7875+200=8075, +35=8110.

Then 4419 + 4423 = 4419 + 4400=8819, +23=8842? 4419+4423=8842.

Now 8110 + 8842 = 8110 + 8800=16910, +42=16952.

Same as before.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, 22) in the spiral grid, where the center (0, 0) contains the number 1, the x-coordinate increases to the right, and the y-coordinate increases downward. This position is the start of ring \(k = 23\), and the neighbors of (23, 22) are the eight adjacent cells: (23, 21), (23, 23), (24, 22), (22, 22), (24, 21), (22, 21), (24, 23), and (22, 23).

The ring and segment for each neighbor are determined, and the corresponding numbers are calculated as follows:

- **(22, 21)**: Ring \(k = 22\), segment 1 (north move). The start number of ring 22 is \(s_{22} = (2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850\). Since \(x = 22 = k\) and \(y = 21 = k - 1\), it is the start point, so the number is 1850.
- **(22, 22)**: Ring \(k = 22\), segment 4 (east move). The offset \(s = x + k - 1 = 22 + 22 - 1 = 43\). The number is \(s_{22} + 6 \times 22 + s = 1850 + 132 + 43 = 2025\).
- **(23, 21)**: Ring \(k = 23\), segment 1 (north move). The start number of ring 23 is \(s_{23} = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\). The offset \(p = (k - 1) - y = 22 - 21 = 1\), so the number is \(s_{23} + p = 2026 + 1 = 2027\).
- **(23, 23)**: Ring \(k = 23\), segment 4 (east move). The offset \(s = x + k - 1 = 23 + 23 - 1 = 45\). The number is \(s_{23} + 6 \times 23 + s = 2026 + 138 + 45 = 2209\).
- **(22, 23)**: Ring \(k = 23\), segment 4 (east move). The offset \(s = x + k - 1 = 22 + 23 - 1 = 44\). The number is \(s_{23} + 6 \times 23 + s = 2026 + 138 + 44 = 2208\).
- **(24, 21)**: Ring \(k = 24\), segment 1 (north move). The start number of ring 24 is \(s_{24} = (2 \times 24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210\). The offset \(p = (k - 1) - y = 23 - 21 = 2\), so the number is \(s_{24} + p = 2210 + 2 = 2212\).
- **(24, 22)**: Ring \(k = 24\), segment 1 (north move). The offset \(p = (k - 1) - y = 23 - 22 = 1\), so the number is \(s_{24} + p = 2210 + 1 = 2211\).
- **(24, 23)**: Ring \(k = 24\), segment 1 (north move). Since \(x = 24 = k\) and \(y = 23 = k - 1\), it is the start point, so the number is \(s_{24} = 2210\).

The neighbors and their numbers are:
- (22, 21): 1850
