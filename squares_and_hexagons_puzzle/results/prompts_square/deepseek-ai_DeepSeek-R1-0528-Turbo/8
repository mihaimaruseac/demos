<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid, starting from 1 in the center. The example shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

So, 1 is at the center, 2 to its right, 3 above 2, 4 above 3, 5 above and left of 4, but it's cut off. From the pattern, it seems like it's spiraling out clockwise: start at 1, go right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, left to 5? That doesn't make sense because after 3 it should go left to 4, but then down or something.

Let me sketch this out properly. Assume the center is at position (0,0). So:

- (0,0) = 1

Then moving right: (1,0) = 2

Then up: (1,1) = 3

Then left: (0,1) = 4? But in the example, above 1 is 3, and left of 3 is 4? The example says:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So, row above: 5,4,3 — so at y=1, x=-1? Let's assign coordinates.

Set (0,0) at 1.

To the right, (1,0) is 2.

Above that, but in the same row? The row above has 3,4,5? Looking at the grid:

It shows:

First row: ... 5 4 3 — so probably x=-1,y=1 is 5? Let's list the positions.

From the given:

At (1,1): ? not given

The grid is incomplete, but:

- At (0,0): 1

- At (1,0): 2 (east)

- At (1,1): ? but above 2 is 3? The example has "3" above "2", so if (1,0) is 2, then directly above it should be (1,1) = 3.

Then left of 3 is 4, so (0,1) = 4

Then left of 4 is 5, so (-1,1) = 5

Then below 5? The next row has 6,1,2 — 1 is at (0,0), so below 5 should be (-1,0)? But it shows 6 at left of 1? "6 1 2", so probably (-1,0) is 6.

Then below that, "7 8 9", so (-1,-1) is 7? Then (0,-1) is 8, (1,-1) is 9.

But 9 is at (1,-1), which is below (1,0)=2, so south of 2 is 9? But earlier north of 2 is 3, so it makes sense.

Now, what about next? After 9, it should go to 10, but not shown. Probably to the right of 9? (2,-1)=10, then up to (2,0)=11? But (1,0) is 2, so (2,0) should be next after 9? Let's think.

The spiral goes: start at 1 (0,0), move right to 2 (1,0), move up to 3 (1,1), move left to 4 (0,1), move left to 5 (-1,1), then down to 6 (-1,0), down to 7 (-1,-1), then right to 8 (0,-1), right to 9 (1,-1), then up? But (1,-1) to (1,0) is already occupied by 2, so it should go up? But (1,0) is taken, so probably it goes right to (2,-1)=10, then up to (2,0)=11, up to (2,1)=12, then left to (1,1) but occupied, so left to (0,1) occupied, so left to (-1,1) occupied, so it must go down? This is messy.

I recall that in such spirals, the direction changes after completing a layer. Specifically, after moving in a direction until it hits a corner, then turns left (clockwise).

So, from start: right until it can't, but at beginning, from 1, go right to 2, then since it's a new layer, it turns up, goes to 3, then turns left, goes to 4, then to 5, then turns down, goes to 6, then to 7, then turns right, goes to 8, then to 9. Now after 9, it should continue right? But (2,-1) is empty, so go right to 10 (2,-1), then it can't go up because (2,0) is empty? After moving right, it should turn up? The rule is: after moving in a direction, when it hits a boundary or occupied cell, it turns clockwise.

Standard Ulam spiral is usually counterclockwise, but here it seems clockwise. In the example, after 1 (center), it goes right to 2, then up to 3, then left to 4,5, then down to 6,7, then right to 8,9. So yes, clockwise: right, up, left, down, repeat.

So sequence of directions: east, north, west, south, east, north, etc.

And it moves until it hits a cell that is already filled or out of bounds, but since it's infinite, probably until it completes the side.

For each "layer" or "ring", the side length increases.

Let me define the rings. The center is ring 0, just the number 1.

Then ring 1: numbers 2 to 9? From 2 to 9 is 8 numbers, which is 3x3 minus center, but 3x3 has 9 cells, center 1, so perimeter has 8 cells: 2 through 9.

In the grid: positions: let's list for ring 1.

Starting from (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9. So yes, 8 numbers: 2 to 9.

Then ring 2 should be from 10 to 25? 4x4 minus inner 3x3, but inner 3x3 has 9 cells, outer 5x5 has 25, so 25-9=16 cells? But ring should be perimeter only.

Each ring has perimeter proportional to size.

Ring k (k>=1) has side length 2k+1? For k=0, size 1.

Ring k: starts at (k,-k+1) or something. General formula.

The numbers on the diagonals or something.

I recall that for a spiral, the position can be found by finding which ring it's in.

The largest number in ring n is (2n+1)^2.

For ring 0: n=0, size 1, max num 1 = (1)^2.

Ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, max 9 = 3^2.

Ring 2: should be numbers 10 to 25, max 25=5^2.

Ring 3: 26 to 49, max 49=7^2.

Yes, so ring n (n>=0) has max number (2n+1)^2.

The min number in ring n is (2n-1)^2 + 1 for n>=1, and for n=0, min=1.

For ring n, min number is the first number after ring n-1 ends.

Ring n-1 ends at (2(n-1)+1)^2 = (2n-1)^2.

So min for ring n is (2n-1)^2 + 1.

Max is (2n+1)^2.

Number of elements in ring n: max - min + 1 = (2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = [4n^2 + 4n +1] - [4n^2 -4n +1] = 8n.

Yes, 8n elements for ring n>=1, and 1 for n=0.

Now, for a given number, find which ring it's in.

So for 2026, find n such that min_ring <= 2026 <= max_ring.

min_ring n = (2n-1)^2 + 1

max_ring n = (2n+1)^2

Set (2n-1)^2 + 1 <= 2026 <= (2n+1)^2

First, find n where (2n-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2n+1)^2

Since min is (2n-1)^2 +1, but for inequality, we can solve (2n-1)^2 <= 2025 < 2026? Better to compute the squares.

Find k such that k^2 <= 2026 < (k+2)^2? Note that max for ring n is (2n+1)^2, min is (2n-1)^2 +1.

Set m = 2n+1, then min is (m-2)^2 +1, but perhaps compute numerically.

Compute sqrt(2026). 44^2=1936, 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025 = 45^2.

Now, (2n+1)^2 = 2025? But 2025 is 45^2, which is odd, so 2n+1=45, so n=22.

Max for ring n=22 is (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

Min for ring n=22 is (2*22-1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2? 2n-1=2*22-1=43? 43^2=1849, so min=1849+1=1850.

So ring 22: min=1850, max=2025.

But 2026 is greater than 2025, so it should be in ring 23.

Ring n=23: min=(2*23-1)^2 +1=(46-1)^2? 2n-1=46-1=45? 45^2=2025, so min=2025+1=2026.

Max=(2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

So yes, 2026 is the first number in ring 23, min=2026.

So it's in ring 23, and it's the smallest number in that ring.

Now, I need to find its position and then its neighbors.

First, find the position of 2026.

Since it's the start of ring 23, and ring n starts at a specific position.

In the spiral, ring n starts at which position?

From the center, ring n starts by moving right from the end of ring n-1.

Ring n-1 ends at (n-1, -(n-1)) or something? Let's see the pattern.

For example, ring 0 ends at (0,0)=1.

Ring 1 starts at (1,0)=2. Which is east of center.

Ring 2 starts at (2,-1)? Earlier, ring 1 ends at (1,-1)=9? Then ring 2 should start at (2,-1)=10? In my earlier assumption.

Ring 1: positions: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

So ends at (1,-1)=9.

Then ring 2 starts at (2,-1)=10? Then moves up: (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then left: (1,1) but occupied by 3? Problem.

After (1,-1)=9, it should go to (2,-1)=10, then since it was going right? When it moves to a new ring, it starts by moving right from the last position? Last position of ring 1 is (1,-1)=9.

From there, to start ring 2, it moves right to (2,-1)=10.

Then, since it's a new ring, it turns clockwise, which is up (since last direction was right? Or standard is to turn up after moving right in new ring.

After moving to (2,-1)=10, it should move up next? To (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then since it can't go further? The side length for ring n is 2n? For ring n, the side length (number of cells per side) is 2n+1? But for perimeter, each side has how many cells.

For ring n, it extends from -n to n in x and y, but excluding inner rings.

The bounding box for ring n is from -n to n, but since it's perimeter, it's the outermost cells.

Specifically, for ring n, the coordinates range from -n to n in both x and y, but only the cells where |x|=n or |y|=n, and |x|<=n, |y|<=n.

In ring n, the cells satisfy max(|x|,|y|) = n.

Yes, that makes sense. For example, ring 1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both? No, max(|x|,|y|)=1 means the larger of |x| and |y| is 1, so it includes corners, like (1,1) max is 1, yes.

In ring 1: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1). All have max(|x|,|y|)=1, since for example (1,1): max(1,1)=1, (1,0):max(1,0)=1, etc. Yes.

Ring 0: max(|x|,|y|)=0, only (0,0).

Now, for ring n, the numbers start from min=(2n-1)^2 +1, and end at (2n+1)^2.

The starting position: for ring n, it starts at (n, -(n-1)) or something? Let's see for n=1: starts at (1,0).

For n=2: should start at (2,-1)? Earlier we thought (2,-1)=10.

max(|x|,|y|)=2, so |x|=2 or |y|=2.

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, yes.

Now, direction: it moves right initially? From (2,-1), it moves up? In ring 2: starts at (2,-1)=10, then moves up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then turns left (west) to (1,1)? But (1,1) is already occupied by 3? Conflict.

I think I messed up. Ring 1 has max=1, ring 2 has max=2, so (2,1) should be in ring 2, but (1,1) is in ring 1, so no conflict.

In ring 2: after (2,-1)=10, move up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12.

Now, next should turn left, which is west, so to (1,1)? But (1,1) is already ring 1, occupied by 3? But ring 2 should be new cells, so (1,1) is already taken, so it shouldn't go there.

Perhaps it moves to (2,2)? But max(|x|,|y|) for (2,2) is 2, which is ring 2, but is it adjacent?

From (2,1), moving west would be to (1,1), but that's occupied, so it should move to the next cell in the direction? Or turn earlier.

The standard way is that for each side, it moves a certain number of steps.

For ring n, each side has 2n cells? Total cells 8n, so each side should have 2n cells? But for n=1, 8*1=8 cells, but a square of side 3 has perimeter 8, but each side has 3 cells? No, for a 3x3 grid, perimeter cells: top row 3 cells, bottom row 3, left and right but corners shared, so total 3*4 - 4 = 8? No, each side has 3 cells, but corners are shared, so total perimeter cells = 4*(side_length) - 4, but for side_length s, perimeter is 4(s-1) if s>1? For s=3, perimeter should be 4*2 =8? 4*(s-1) =4*2=8, yes.

But s = 2n+1 for ring n, so perimeter = 4*( (2n+1) - 1 ) = 4*(2n) = 8n, yes.

Each side has s cells? For s=3, each side has 3 cells, but corners are included in both sides, but in the perimeter count, each corner is counted once, but when traversing, each side has s cells, but the corners are shared.

In the spiral path, when traversing a side, it includes the corner cells.

For ring n, side length s = 2n+1.

But the number of cells per side in the traversal: since it's a path, and corners are traversed once, but each side between corners has (s-1) cells, plus corners, but total per side is s cells.

For example, ring 1: s=3.

Start at (1,0), move up: to (1,1), then to (0,1)? But (0,1) is corner? In sequence: from (1,0) to (1,1) — that's one move, but two cells? The path: from start (1,0), move up to (1,1), then left to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), then down to (-1,0), etc.

So for the east side? Actually, it's moving along the perimeter.

For ring n, it starts at (n, -(n-1)) ? For n=1: (1, -(0)) = (1,0), correct.

Then it moves up (north) for how many steps? From (1,0) to (1,1), then to (0,1)? But (0,1) is not on the same side.

The direction: it moves north until it reaches y=n? For n=1, from (1,0) to (1,1), and since |y|=1=n, and it's the top-right corner, then it turns west.

From (1,1), it moves west to (0,1), then to (-1,1). Now at (-1,1), which is top-left corner, max(|x|,|y|)=1, then turns south to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1), then turns east to (0,-1), then to (1,-1).

So for each side, it moves a certain number of cells.

From start (1,0) to (1,1): two cells? Positions: (1,0) and (1,1), so two cells for the northward move? But it moved from (1,0) to (1,1), so one move, but covered two cells: start and end.

In terms of cells visited: when it moves from a cell to another, it visits both, but the move is between cells.

In the sequence, for the first move (after start), it moves to the next cell.

Total cells in ring: 8n.

The ring is divided into four sides: east, north, west, south.

Each side has how many cells? For ring n, each side has 2n cells? For n=1, 2*1=2 cells per side? But earlier, for east side? In ring 1, what is east side? Typically, the sides are: right side (x=n), top side (y=n), left side (x=-n), bottom side (y=-n).

For ring n, right side: x=n, y from -n to n? But corners are shared.

In the traversal, the sequence is:

- Start at (n, -(n-1)) ? For n=1, (1,0)

- Move north to (n, n): so from y= -(n-1) to y=n, which is a change of n - (-(n-1)) = n + n -1 = 2n-1? But number of moves.

From (n, -(n-1)) to (n, n): the y-coordinates from -(n-1) to n.

The number of steps: y increases from -(n-1) to n, so delta y = n - (-(n-1)) = n + n -1 = 2n-1.

But number of cells visited: from y=a to y=b, number of cells is |b-a| +1.

Here, from y= -(n-1) to y=n, so |n - (-(n-1))| +1 = |n + n -1| +1 = |2n-1| +1 = 2n-1 +1 = 2n.

Since n>=1.

For n=1: from y=0 to y=1, cells: (1,0) and (1,1), so two cells, yes 2*1=2.

Then next, at (n,n)=(1,1), it turns west, moves to (-n,n)=(-1,1).

From x=n to x=-n, delta x = -n - n = -2n, but number of cells: from x=n to x=-n, | -n - n | +1? From n to -n, difference in x is -2n, number of cells is | -2n | +1? But that would be 2n+1, but for n=1, from (1,1) to (-1,1), cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), so three cells? But 2n+1=3 for n=1, but earlier we have only two cells before? Total should be 8n.

After moving north to (n,n), it moves west to (-n,n).

From (n,n) to (-n,n), x from n to -n, so delta x = -2n, number of cells: |n - (-n)| +1 = 2n +1? For n=1, 3 cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1).

But earlier north side had 2 cells: (1,0),(1,1). So total so far 2+3=5, but should be 8 for n=1.

Problem: (1,1) is counted in both? Yes, corner is shared.

In the path, when it moves from (n,-(n-1)) to (n,n), it visits cells with x=n, y from -(n-1) to n.

y starts at -(n-1), ends at n, so y-values: -(n-1), -(n-1)+1, ..., n.

Number of y-values: from -(n-1) to n inclusive, so integers: n - (-(n-1)) +1 = n + n -1 +1 = 2n.

Similarly, when it moves west from (n,n) to (-n,n), x from n to -n, so x-values: n, n-1, ..., -n.

Number: n - (-n) +1 = 2n+1? But this includes (n,n) again.

So to avoid double-counting corners, in the traversal, each corner is visited once, but in this description, when moving north, it ends at (n,n), then starts moving west from (n,n), so (n,n) is visited twice? No, in the sequence, it's only once.

In the path, it visits each cell once, so for the northward move, it moves from the start cell to the corner, but not including the corner? Let's list for n=1.

Start at (1,0). Move north to (1,1). So cells visited: (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,1) is the corner.

Then from (1,1) move west to (0,1), then to (-1,1). So cells: (0,1), (-1,1).

Then from (-1,1) move south to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1). Cells: (-1,0), (-1,-1).

Then from (-1,-1) move east to (0,-1), then to (1,-1). Cells: (0,-1), (1,-1).

Total cells: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1) — 8 cells, good.

Now, the moves:

- North: from (1,0) to (1,1): but this is moving from start to first corner, but it visited two cells: (1,0) and (1,1).

The number of cells in this leg: 2.

Then west: from (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1): visited three cells? (1,1) is already visited, but in this leg, it moves to (0,1) and (-1,1), so two new cells? But in sequence, when it moves from (1,1) to (0,1), it visits (0,1), then to (-1,1), visits (-1,1). So cells visited during west move: (0,1) and (-1,1)? But (1,1) was visited in previous move.

So for each "leg", the number of cells visited in that direction is the number of moves plus one, but since it starts from a cell, each move adds a new cell.

In the north move, it starts at (1,0), moves north to (1,1), so it adds one new cell: (1,1).

Similarly, in west move, starts at (1,1), moves west to (0,1), adds (0,1), then to (-1,1), adds (-1,1). So adds two new cells.

Then south: starts at (-1,1), moves south to (-1,0), adds (-1,0), then to (-1,-1), adds (-1,-1). Adds two cells.

Then east: starts at (-1,-1), moves east to (0,-1), adds (0,-1), then to (1,-1), adds (1,-1). Adds two cells.

Total added: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7, but should be 8. Missing the start? The very first cell is not added by a move.

Problem: when it starts at (1,0), that cell is visited, but not added by a move in this ring; it's the starting point.

So total cells: start cell plus cells added by moves.

For north move: it moves north once, adding one cell (1,1).

For west move: it moves west twice? From (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), so two moves, adding two cells: (0,1) and (-1,1).

Similarly, south: two moves to (-1,0) and (-1,-1).

East: two moves to (0,-1) and (1,-1).

Total added by moves: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7, plus start cell, total 8.

Now for general n.

For ring n, it starts at (n, -(n-1)) ? For n=1, (1, -0) = (1,0), good.

Then it moves north: how many times? It moves north until it reaches y=n, but from y= -(n-1) to y=n, delta y = n - (-(n-1)) = 2n-1, but since it moves in steps, number of moves is the number of steps to increase y by 2n-1? But each move increases y by 1, so number of moves = 2n-1? But for n=1, 2*1-1=1 move, which added one cell, correct.

After moving north, it is at (n,n).

Then it moves west: to x= -n. From x=n to x=-n, delta x = -2n, so number of moves = | -2n | = 2n? But each move decreases x by 1, so 2n moves? For n=1, 2*1=2 moves, added two cells, correct.

Then at (-n,n), it moves south to y= -n. From y=n to y=-n, delta y = -2n, so number of moves = 2n? For n=1, 2 moves, added two cells.

Then at (-n,-n), it moves east to x=n. From x=-n to x=n, delta x=2n, so number of moves=2n? But for n=1, 2 moves, added two cells.

But total moves: north: 2n-1? For n=1, north moves:1, west:2, south:2, east:2, total moves 1+2+2+2=7, plus start, 8 cells.

But for general n, north moves: 2n-1? But number of cells added: each move adds one cell, so north adds 2n-1 cells? But for n=1, adds 1 cell (since one move), but earlier we had only one cell added, but the start is separate.

Total cells added by moves: north: k moves add k cells, etc.

Total moves: let N_n be number of north moves, etc.

From above: north: 2n-1 moves? For n=1, 1 move.

West: 2n moves? For n=1, 2 moves.

South: 2n moves? For n=1, 2 moves.

East: 2n moves? For n=1, 2 moves.

Total moves: (2n-1) + 2n + 2n + 2n = 8n -1.

Each move adds one cell, and start cell is extra, so total cells = 1 + (8n -1) = 8n, good.

Now, for the starting point: (n, -(n-1))

Now, 2026 is in ring n=23, and it is the first number, so it is at the starting position of ring 23.

So position: x = n = 23

y = -(n-1) = -(23-1) = -22

So (23, -22)

Now, I need the sum of its eight neighbors.

The neighbors are the eight adjacent cells: north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest.

That is, (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y), (x+1,y-1), (x,y-1), (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y), (x-1,y+1)

In this spiral, not all neighbors may be filled, but since it's an infinite grid and numbers are filled in order, but actually, for a cell in the middle of a ring, some neighbors might be in the same ring, some in previous rings, but since we're summing the numbers, and the grid is filled consecutively, but neighbors could be smaller or larger numbers.

Specifically, for a cell at (x,y), its neighbors are at distance 1, so |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, not both zero.

Now, for (23,-22), which is on the "east side" of the ring, since x=n=23, y=-22, which is not the corners.

Now, the corners for ring n=23: the corners are (n,n)=(23,23), (n,-n)=(23,-23), (-n,n)=(-23,23), (-n,-n)=(-23,-23)

Now, our point is (23,-22), so y=-22, while min y for this ring is -n=-23, max y=n=23.

Since it's on the right side (x=23), and y=-22, which is above the bottom corner (23,-23).

Now, the neighbors:

List them:

N: (23, -22+1) = (23,-21)

NE: (24,-21)

E: (24,-22)

SE: (24,-23)

S: (23,-23)

SW: (22,-23)

W: (22,-22)

NW: (22,-21)

Now, each of these may or may not be occupied by numbers, but since the spiral fills all integers, and it's infinite, all these positions have numbers assigned.

But we need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since the spiral is filled in order, we can find for each neighbor position, which ring it's in, and then its number based on position.

First, note that the ring of a cell is determined by max(|x|,|y|).

For a cell (x,y), ring r = max(|x|,|y|).

Because earlier we defined ring n by max(|x|,|y|)=n.

So for each neighbor, compute max(|x|,|y|), which gives the ring number.

Then, within the ring, we can find the position and compute the number.

So let's compute for each neighbor:

1. N: (23,-21) → |x|=23, |y|=21 → max=23 → ring 23

2. NE: (24,-21) → |x|=24, |y|=21 → max=24 → ring 24

3. E: (24,-22) → |x|=24, |y|=22 → max=24 → ring 24

4. SE: (24,-23) → |x|=24, |y|=23 → max=24 → ring 24

5. S: (23,-23) → |x|=23, |y|=23 → max=23 → ring 23

6. SW: (22,-23) → |x|=22, |y|=23 → max=23 → ring 23

7. W: (22,-22) → |x|=22, |y|=22 → max=22 → ring 22? |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, so ring 22.

8. NW: (22,-21) → |x|=22, |y|=21 → max=22 → ring 22

So, neighbors in ring 23: N(23,-21), S(23,-23), SW(22,-23)

In ring 24: NE(24,-21), E(24,-22), SE(24,-23)

In ring 22: W(22,-22), NW(22,-21)

Now, ring 22,23,24 are different rings, so we need to compute the number for each position in its ring.

First, recall that for ring r, min number is (2r-1)^2 + 1

Max number is (2r+1)^2

And total cells 8r.

Now, the position within the ring determines the number.

The ring is traversed in order: start at (r, -(r-1)), move north to (r,r), then west to (-r,r), then south to (-r,-r), then east to (r,-r).

But (r,-r) is the end, but for ring r, it ends at (r,-r)? For example, ring 1: starts (1,0), ends (1,-1)? Yes, (1,-1)=9.

Ring 2: starts (2,-1)=10, ends? Should be (2,-2)? Max num 25, position? After moving east: from (-2,-2) to (2,-2)? For ring 2: start (2,-1)=10, move north to (2,2)? From (2,-1) to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? Then west to (1,2)=14? (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17? Then south to (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20? Then east to (-1,-1)=21? But (-1,-1) is ring 1? Conflict.

For ring 2, max(|x|,|y|)=2.

Start at (2,-1)? But |y|=1<2, but max is 2? (2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ok.

Move north: to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13. Now at (2,2), max=2.

Then west: to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17. Now at (-2,2).

Then south: to (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20? But (-2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ok. Then to (-2,-2)=21? max(2,2)=2.

Then east: to (-1,-2)=22? (-1,-2): max(1,2)=2, ok. Then (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25.

Ends at (2,-2)=25.

Now, our point for ring 23 is (23,-22), which is similar to (2,-1) for ring 2? (2,-1) is the start for ring 2.

But for (23,-22), it's not the start; the start is (23, -(23-1)) = (23,-22), exactly! Since n=23, start is (n, -(n-1)) = (23,-22). Yes, so it is the start of ring 23.

Now, neighbors:

We have:

- N: (23,-21) — same ring, ring 23

- S: (23,-23) — same ring

- SW: (22,-23) — same ring

- NE: (24,-21) — ring 24

- E: (24,-22) — ring 24

- SE: (24,-23) — ring 24

- W: (22,-22) — ring 22

- NW: (22,-21) — ring 22

Now, since the spiral fills rings in order, ring 22 is filled before ring 23, which is before ring 24. So numbers in ring 22 are smaller than in ring 23, which are smaller than in ring 24.

Specifically, min ring 22: (2*22-1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1? 2r-1=2*22-1=43, 43^2=1849, min=1850.

Max ring 22: (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

Min ring 23: (2*23-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Max ring 23: (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

Min ring 24: (2*24-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Max ring 24: (2*24+1)^2=49^2=2401.

Now, our number is 2026 at (23,-22), which is min of ring 23.

Now, neighbors:

First, those in ring 22: W(22,-22) and NW(22,-21)

Ring 22 is already filled, since ring 23 starts after it.

We need to find the number at these positions in ring 22.

Similarly, for ring 23 neighbors, they are in the same ring, so we need their relative positions.

For ring 24, they are in higher ring, so larger numbers.

Now, let's compute each one.

First, neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Ring 22: min number = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850

Max number = 45^2 = 2025

Start position: (22, -(22-1)) = (22,-21)? For r=22, start at (r, -(r-1)) = (22,-21)

Exactly! So (22,-21) is the start of ring 22.

So number at (22,-21) is min ring 22 = 1850.

Now, what about (22,-22)? 

In ring 22, start at (22,-21), then it moves north to (22,22)? 

The sequence: start at (22,-21), move north to (22,-20), (22,-19), ..., up to (22,22).

Number of north moves: earlier we had for north direction, number of moves is 2r-1 = 2*22-1=43.

Each move adds a cell, so after k moves, it has added k cells.

Start at cell 1: (22,-21) = 1850

After first north move: to (22,-20) = next number, 1851

After second: (22,-19)=1852, and so on.

The y-coordinate: starts at y=-21, each north move increases y by 1.

After k moves, y = -21 + k

It moves north until y=22, so when y=22, k such that -21 + k = 22 ⇒ k=43.

After 43 moves, it reaches (22,22), and the number is start + number of moves = 1850 + 43 = 1893? Since each move adds one number.

The numbers increase by 1 for each step in the path.

So, from start (22,-21) = 1850

After one move north: (22,-20) = 1851

After two moves: (22,-19)=1852

...

After m moves: (22, -21 + m) = 1850 + m

Set y = -21 + m, so m = y - (-21) = y + 21

Thus number = 1850 + (y + 21)

At (22,-22), y=-22

So m = -22 + 21 = -1? But m is number of moves, can't be negative.

The position (22,-22) is not on the north path; it's on the east path or something.

In ring 22, the path is:

Start at (22,-21)

Move north: to (22,-20), (22,-19), ..., (22,22) — this is the east side? x=22, constant.

After moving north to (22,22), then it moves west to (-22,22), then south to (-22,-22), then east to (22,-22).

Now, (22,-22) is the end of the ring, since for ring r, ends at (r,-r).

For r=22, ends at (22,-22).

Now, what number is there?

Total cells in ring: 8*22=176

Min is 1850, max is 2025, and 1850 + 176 -1 = 1850 + 175 = 2025? 1850 to 2025 inclusive: 2025 - 1850 +1 = 176, yes.

Since it ends at (22,-22), and it's the last cell, so number is max = 2025.

We can compute the path.

From start (22,-21)=1850

Move north: 43 moves? Earlier for north moves: number is 2r-1=43 for r=22.

After 43 north moves, it reaches (22,22), and number = 1850 + 43 = 1893? Since each move adds one number, so after k moves, number is start + k.

After first move: position (22,-20), number 1851

After second: (22,-19), 1852

...

After 43rd north move: position (22,-21 + 43) = (22,22), number 1850 + 43 = 1893.

But earlier we thought max is 2025, so not yet.

After north moves, it moves west.

Number of west moves: 2r = 2*22=44? Earlier general: west moves: 2n moves.

After moving west, it adds 44 cells? Total moves so far: start plus north moves: 1 + 43 =44 cells? Start cell and 43 moves, so 44 cells covered? But total ring has 176 cells.

After north moves: it has covered from start to (22,22), which is 44 cells? y from -21 to 22 inclusive: number of integers: 22 - (-21) +1 = 22+21+1=44, yes.

But these are all on x=22, but ring has other sides.

Now, at (22,22), it starts moving west.

Number of west moves: 2r=44.

Each west move decreases x by 1.

So moves to (21,22), (20,22), ..., down to (-22,22).

After k west moves, position (22 - k, 22)

Number: since each move adds one number, after first west move: to (21,22), number = previous +1 = 1893 +1 =1894? After arriving at (22,22) is 1893, then move west to (21,22), which is next number, 1894.

Similarly, after m west moves, number = 1893 + m

Position: x=22 - m, y=22

Set x=22 - m, so m=22 - x

Number = 1893 + (22 - x)

When it reaches x=-22, m=22 - (-22)=44, so after 44 moves, position (-22,22), number=1893 +44=1937.

Now, then it moves south: number of south moves: 2r=44.

Each south move decreases y by 1.

So from (-22,22), move south to (-22,21), (-22,20), ..., to (-22,-22)

After k south moves, position (-22, 22 - k)

Number: after first move: to (-22,21), number=1937 +1=1938

After k moves: number=1937 + k

Position y=22 - k

Set y=22 - k, so k=22 - y

Number=1937 + (22 - y)

At y=-22, k=22 - (-22)=44, number=1937+44=1981.

Then it moves east: number of east moves: 2r=44? Earlier east moves: 2n for n=r.

From (-22,-22), move east to (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., to (22,-22)

After k east moves, position (-22 + k, -22)

Number: after first: (-21,-22), number=1981 +1=1982

After k moves: number=1981 + k

Position x= -22 + k

Set x= -22 + k, so k= x + 22

Number=1981 + (x + 22)

At x=22, k=22+22=44, number=1981+44=2025, correct.

Now, we need positions: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, (22,-21): this is the start position, so number=1850.

Now, (22,-22): this is on the east path? In the east move, when it moves from (-22,-22) to (22,-22), but (22,-22) is the end.

From above, for east path: position (x,-22), number=1981 + (x + 22)

At (22,-22): x=22, number=1981 + (22 + 22) = 1981 + 44 = 2025.

Since it's the end, max of ring.

Now, we also have NW: (22,-21)

(22,-21): this is the start, as we said, 1850.

But is it? (22,-21) is exactly the start, so yes, 1850.

Now, but we have two neighbors: W(22,-22) and NW(22,-21)

W is (22,-22), which is 2025

NW is (22,-21), which is 1850

Now, next, neighbors in ring 23: N(23,-21), S(23,-23), SW(22,-23)

Ring 23: min number=2026, at start (23,-22)

Now, the path:

Start at (23,-22)=2026

Move north: number of moves=2r-1=2*23-1=45

Each north move increases y by 1.

So after k north moves, position (23, -22 + k)

Number=2026 + k  (since each move adds one number)

Start is 2026, after first move north: (23,-21)=2027, etc.

We need:

N: (23,-21) — this is after one north move? Start is (23,-22)=2026

After first north move: to (23,-21)=2027? Since y increases from -22 to -21.

k=0: (23,-22)=2026

After k moves: position (23, -22 + k), number=2026 + k

For (23,-21): y=-21, so -22 + k = -21 ⇒ k=1

Thus number=2026 + 1 = 2027

S: (23,-23)

y=-23

Set -22 + k = -23 ⇒ k= -1? Not possible.

This is not on the north path. It might be on the south path or end.

The south path: after moving west and south, it moves east and ends at (23,-23)? For ring r, ends at (r,-r)=(23,-23)

Now, where is it in the path.

The path: start (23,-22)=2026

Move north: to (23,-21), (23,-20), ..., (23,23)

After north moves: number of moves=45, so after 45 moves, at (23,23), number=2026 +45=2071? Since each move adds one, so after k moves, number=2026 + k

At (23,23): k=45? Position: y= -22 + k =23 ⇒ k=23 - (-22)=45? -22 + k=23 ⇒ k=45, yes. Number=2026+45=2071.

Then move west: number of moves=2r=46

To (-23,23)

After m west moves, position (23 - m, 23), number=2071 + m  (since each move adds one)

At (-23,23): m=23 - (-23)=46? x=23 - m = -23 ⇒ m=46, number=2071+46=2117.

Then move south: number of moves=46? 2r=46

To (-23,-23)

After p south moves, position (-23, 23 - p), number=2117 + p

At (-23,-23): y=23 - p = -23 ⇒ p=46, number=2117+46=2163.

Then move east: number of moves=46? To (23,-23)

After q east moves, position (-23 + q, -23), number=2163 + q

At (23,-23): x=-23 + q =23 ⇒ q=46, number=2163+46=2209, which is max, good.

Now, we need positions:

S: (23,-23) — this is the end, so number=2209

SW: (22,-23)

This is on the east path? When moving east from (-23,-23) to (23,-23)

Position: during east move, (x,-23), number=2163 + (x - (-23)) ? Earlier: position x= -23 + q, so q= x + 23

Number=2163 + q = 2163 + (x + 23)

At (22,-23): x=22, so number=2163 + (22 + 23) = 2163 + 45 = 2208? 22+23=45, yes.

Since it's the second last? From (-23,-23) to (23,-23), total 46 moves? Positions: x from -23 to 23, but step by step.

Start at (-23,-23)=2163? After south moves, it ends at (-23,-23)=2163? Earlier at end of south: (-23,-23)=2163? But then it moves east from there.

After arriving at (-23,-23), number is 2163, then it moves east to next cell.

After first east move: to (-22,-23), number=2164

After second: (-21,-23)=2165

...

After q moves: to (-23 + q, -23), number=2163 + q

Set x= -23 + q, so q= x + 23

Number=2163 + (x + 23)

At x=22: q=22+23=45, number=2163+45=2208

Since total moves 46, and it ends at (23,-23)=2163+46=2209, so at (22,-23), it is one before last, so 2208? 2209 -1=2208, yes.

Now, also N: (23,-21)=2027, as computed earlier.

Now, finally, neighbors in ring 24: NE(24,-21), E(24,-22), SE(24,-23)

Ring 24: min number= (2*24-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Start position: (24, -(24-1)) = (24,-23)? r=24, start at (r, -(r-1)) = (24,-23)

Now, we need:

SE: (24,-23) — this is exactly the start, so number=2210

E: (24,-22)

NE: (24,-21)

In ring 24, start at (24,-23)=2210

Then it moves north: number of moves=2r-1=2*24-1=47? 48-1=47.

Each north move increases y by 1.

So after k north moves, position (24, -23 + k), number=2210 + k

For E: (24,-22) — y=-22

Set -23 + k = -22 ⇒ k=1

So number=2210 + 1 = 2211

For NE: (24,-21) — y=-21

-23 + k = -21 ⇒ k=2

Number=2210 + 2 = 2212

Now, we have all neighbors' numbers.

List them:

1. N (23,-21): 2027

2. NE (24,-21): 2212

3. E (24,-22): 2211

4. SE (24,-23): 2210

5. S (23,-23): 2209

6. SW (22,-23): 2208

7. W (22,-22): 2025? Earlier for ring 22

8. NW (22,-21): 1850

Now, sum them up.

List:

2027, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2209, 2208, 2025, 1850

Now, sum.

Notice that 2027 and 2025 are close, but others are larger.

Group them.

First, the ring 24 neighbors: NE, E, SE: 2212, 2211, 2210

Sum: 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = let's compute: 2210+2212=4422, plus 2211=6633? Or 2210+2210+2210=6630, plus 1+2+0? Better: 2212 + 2211 = 4423, plus 2210=6633.

2212 + 2210 = 4422, plus 2211=6633, yes.

Now, ring 23 neighbors: N, S, SW: 2027, 2209, 2208

Sum: 2027 + 2208 + 2209

First, 2208 + 2209 = 4417

Plus 2027: 4417 + 2027 = 6444? 4400+2000=6400, 17+27=44, total 6444.

2208 + 2027 = 4235, plus 2209: 4235 + 2209 = 6444, yes.

Now, ring 22 neighbors: W and NW: 2025 and 1850

Sum: 2025 + 1850 = 3875

Now, total sum: ring24 + ring23 + ring22 sums: 6633 + 6444 + 3875

First, 6633 + 6444 = 13077

Then 13077 + 3875

13077 + 3800 = 16877

16877 + 75 = 16952? 3875 = 3800 + 75, yes.

13077 + 3875:

77 + 75 = 152, write 52, carry 15? Better:

13077

+ 3875

------

Start from right: 7+5=12, write 2, carry 1

7+7=14, plus 1=15, write 5, carry 1

0+8=8, plus 1=9, write 9

3+3=6, write 6

1+0=1? 13077 has 5 digits, 3875 has 4, so:

  13077

+  3875

------

Align:

  13077

+  3875

= 16952? Compute: 13077 + 3000=16077, +875=16077+800=16877, +75=16952. Yes.

So sum is 16952.

But let me double-check the numbers.

List all neighbors and numbers:

- N: (23,-21) = 2027

- NE: (24,-21) = 2212

- E: (24,-22) = 2211

- SE: (24,-23) = 2210

- S: (23,-23) = 2209

- SW: (22,-23) = 2208

- W: (22,-22) = 2025

- NW: (22,-21) = 1850

Now sum: add them step by step.

Add NW and N: 1850 + 2027 = 3877? Earlier I had W and NW as 2025 and 1850, but N is different.

In sum, all eight.

Start from smallest: 1850

Add 2025: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Add 2027: 3875 + 2027 = 5902

Add 2208: 5902 + 2208 = 8110

Add 2209: 8110 + 2209 = 10319

Add 2210: 10319 + 2210 = 12529

Add 2211: 12529 + 2211 = 14740

Add 2212: 14740 + 2212 = 16952

Same as before.

Notice that the numbers are consecutive in some sense, but not exactly.

Another way: since most are consecutive, but mixed.

But anyway, we have 16952.

Now, is this correct? Let me verify with a smaller example to see if the method works.

Suppose we take the number 1 at (0,0). What are its neighbors?

From the grid: east (1,0)=2, north-east? (1,1)=3? In the example: neighbors are: north: (0,1)=4? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? At (1,1)=3? Confusion.

In the initial grid:

Positions: assume (0,0)=1

Then (1,0)=2

(1,1)=3? But in the example, "above 1 is 3", but if (0,0)=1, then north should be (0,1), but in the grid it shows "3" above "2", and "4" left of "3", so:

Looking at:

Row y=1: ...5,4,3 so x=-1,y=1:5; x=0,y=1:4; x=1,y=1:3

Row y=0: ...6,1,2 so x=-1,y=0:6; x=0,y=0:1; x=1,y=0:2

Row y=-1: ...7,8,9 so x=-1,y=-1:7; x=0,y=-1:8; x=1,y=-1:9

So neighbors of (0,0)=1:

N: (0,1)=4

NE: (1,1)=3

E: (1,0)=2

SE: (1,-1)=9? Since y=-1

S: (0,-1)=8

SW: (-1,-1)=7

W: (-1,0)=6

NW: (-1,1)=5

So neighbors: 4,3,2,9,8,7,6,5

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= let's see, 2+9=11, 3+8=11, 4+7=11, 5+6=11, so 4*11=44.

Now, according to our method: for number 1, ring n=0.

Position (0,0)

Neighbors: all ring 1, since max(|x|,|y|)=1 for all.

Ring 1: min=2, max=9.

Positions:

N: (0,1) — in ring 1, what number? Ring 1 path: start (1,0)=2, move north to (1,1)=3, then west to (0,1)=4, etc.

At (0,1): as above, 4.

Similarly, others.

But in our calculation for 2026, we have neighbors in different rings, but for 1, all neighbors are in ring 1.

Sum is 44.

Now, if we compute with formula: each neighbor in ring 1.

But we didn't need to, but just for check.

Now, another check: say number 2 at (1,0).

Its neighbors: should be eight neighbors.

Positions:

N: (1,1)=3

NE: (2,1)? Not in the grid, but should be later number. In ring 1, max(|x|,|y|)=1, so neighbors: |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1.

So for (1,0):

N: (1,1)=3

NE: (2,1) — max(2,1)=2, ring 2

E: (2,0) — ring 2

SE: (2,-1) — ring 2? Since max(2,1)=2? |x|=2,|y|=0? max=2

S: (1,-1)=9

SW: (0,-1)=8

W: (0,0)=1

NW: (0,1)=4

So neighbors: 3 (N), ? (NE), ? (E), ? (SE), 9 (S), 8 (SW), 1 (W), 4 (NW)

NE, E, SE are in ring 2, since max(|x|,|y|)=2.

Ring 2 min=10.

But in actual, what are they? After ring 1, ring 2 starts at (2,-1)=10, then (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, etc.

So NE(2,1)=12? Since after (2,-1)=10, move north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12.

E(2,0)=11

SE(2,-1)=10

S(1,-1)=9

SW(0,-1)=8

W(0,0)=1

NW(0,1)=4

N(1,1)=3

So neighbors: 12,11,10,9,8,1,4,3

Sum: 12+11+10+9+8+1+4+3

Add: 12+11=23, +10=33, +9=42, +8=50, +1=51, +4=55, +3=58.

Now, according to our method for (1,0), ring? max(|x|,|y|)=max(1,0)=1, so ring 1.

Min ring 1: (2*1-1)^2 +1=1^2 +1=2, which is correct.

Position: in ring 1, start is (1,0), so it's the start.

Neighbors:

Compute:

N: (1,1) — same ring, ring 1. Position: in path, after start, move north to (1,1), so number= min +1? Start=2, after first move=3, so (1,1)=3.

S: (1,-1) — in ring 1, what? From path: after moving west and south, it moves east to (1,-1). Specifically, after moving south to (-1,-1)=7, then east to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9. So (1,-1)=9.

W: (0,0) — max(|x|,|y|)=max(0,0)=0, ring 0, number=1.

NW: (0,1) — ring 1, (0,1)=4.

NE: (2,1) — max(2,1)=2, ring 2. Start of ring 2? Ring 2 start at (2,-1)=10? But (2,1) is not start.

In ring 2: start (2,-1)=10, move north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12. So (2,1)=12.

E: (2,0)=11

SE: (2,-1)=10? Since start.

SW: (0,-1) — ring 1, (0,-1)=8.

So same as above: 3,12,11,10,9,8,1,4 sum to 3+12=15,11=26,10=36,9=45,8=53,1=54,4=58. Correct.

Now back to our sum for 2026 neighbors: we have 16952.

But in the list, we have numbers from 1850 to 2212, sum 16952 seems reasonable.

Notice that in our list: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212

We can pair: smallest and largest: 1850 and 2212 sum=4062

Next: 2025 and 2211? 2025+2211=4236

Then 2027 and 2210=4237

Then 2208 and 2209=4417? But we have eight numbers.

List sorted: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212

Pairs: 1850+2212=4062

2025+2211=4236

2027+2210=4237

2208+2209=4417

Now sum: 4062+4236=8298

4237+4417=8654

Then 8298+8654=16952 same.

Average around 2100, 8*2100=16800, close to 16952.

So seems correct.

Therefore, the sum is 16952.

But the problem is to sum the neighbors, and we have eight neighbors, all computed.

So answer should be 16952.

But let me confirm the position again.

Number 2026 is at (23,-22), start of ring 23.

Neighbors as above.

Another way: since it's the start, and neighbors include the previous end and next start, etc.

But anyway, I think it's correct.

So the sum is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, as it is the first number in ring 23. The eight neighbors and their corresponding numbers are as follows:

- North neighbor (23, -21): 2027
- Northeast neighbor (24, -21): 2212
- East neighbor (24, -22): 2211
- Southeast neighbor (24, -23): 2210
- South neighbor (23, -23): 2209
- Southwest neighbor (22, -23): 2208
- West neighbor (22, -22): 2025
- Northwest neighbor (22, -21): 1850

Summing these values:
- 2027 + 2212 = 4239
- 4239 + 2211 = 6450
- 6450 + 2210 = 8660
- 8660 + 2209 = 10869
- 10869 + 2208 = 13077
- 13077 + 2025 = 15102
- 15102 + 1850 = 16952

The sum of all eight neighbors is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
