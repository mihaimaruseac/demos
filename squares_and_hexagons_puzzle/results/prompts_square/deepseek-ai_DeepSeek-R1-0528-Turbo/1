<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows a snippet:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand how the spiral is constructed and locate where 2026 is in this spiral.

The spiral starts at 1 in the center, then moves right to 2, down to 3? Looking at the grid:

It shows:

5 4 3

6 1 2

7 8 9

So, center is 1, to the right is 2, above 2 should be 3? But it's shown above 1? Let me sketch this.

Assume the center is at some coordinates. Set (0,0) as the center, with 1 there.

Then, moving right: so (1,0) is 2.

Then, moving up? The next number is 3, which is above 2? But in the grid, above 1 is 4? I'm confused.

Looking at the grid:

The row above: 5,4,3 – so if center is 1, then directly above 1 is 4? But that doesn't make sense because typically spirals go outwards.

Perhaps the grid is oriented differently. Let me read the grid carefully.

It says:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So, relative to 1, to the east is 2, to the north is 4? North-east is 3? South-east is 8? That seems messy.

Perhaps the spiral is built outward, but the grid is shown with rows.

Let me try to list the numbers in order.

Start at 1.

Then move right to 2.

Then move down? But down would be below 1, but in the grid below 1 is 8? No.

After 2, it should go to 3. Where is 3? In the grid, it's above 2 and to the left of 4? The grid shows 3 in the top-right corner of this snippet.

Perhaps I need to see the sequence.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are placed in a counter-clockwise spiral, starting right, then up, left, down, etc.

Standard Ulam spiral or something.

Start at center 1.

Move right to 2.

Then move up to 3? But in the grid, above 2 is not 3; above 1 is 4, above 2 is 3? In the snippet, directly above 1 is 4, but above 2 should be the same row? Let's assign coordinates.

Set the center 1 at (0,0).

Then, to the right, (1,0) is 2.

Now, next number 3 should be placed. Typically, after right, it turns up. So from (1,0), move up to (1,1) for 3.

Then, since it's a spiral, after up, it turns left. So from (1,1), move left to (0,1) for 4.

Then down? From (0,1) move down to (0,0), but that's occupied, so it must turn right. Standard spiral: after placing 4 at (0,1), next is down-left or something.

From (0,1), move down to (0,0) but occupied, so it turns right? I think I have it wrong.

Standard sequence: start at (0,0)=1.

Move right to (1,0)=2.

Move up to (1,1)=3.

Move left to (0,1)=4.

Now, move left again? To (-1,1)? But typically, after left, it should go down.

From (0,1), moving left would be to (-1,1), but in the grid, left of 4 is 5? In snippet, left of 4 is 5, so (-1,1)=5.

Then down to (-1,0)=6.

Then down to (-1,-1)=7.

Then right to (0,-1)=8.

Then right to (1,-1)=9.

Then up to (1,0) but occupied, so next? After 9 at (1,-1), it should go up to (1,0), but occupied by 2, so it must turn left or something. But 10 should be at (2,-1) or what?

Let's list the positions:

- 1: (0,0)

- 2: (1,0)

- 3: (1,1)

- 4: (0,1)

- 5: (-1,1)

- 6: (-1,0)

- 7: (-1,-1)

- 8: (0,-1)

- 9: (1,-1)

Now next should be 10. From (1,-1), if it continues right, to (2,-1)=10.

Then up? To (2,0)=11, then (2,1)=12, then left to (1,2)? Let's see.

In the snippet, it shows 5,4,3 which are (-1,1),(0,1),(1,1) — so y=1 row: x=-1,0,1: 5,4,3.

Below that, y=0: 6,1,2 so x=-1,0,1: 6 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0)

Then below, y=-1: 7,8,9 so (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

Now 10 should be at (2,-1), since from (1,-1) moving right.

Then 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2)? After (2,1), it should turn left to (1,2), but (1,2) is not yet filled.

Standard spiral: after completing a layer, it expands.

The spiral goes in rings. The center is ring 0, just 1.

Then ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, which is 8 numbers.

2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — yes, 8 numbers.

Then ring 2: 10 to 25? Let me calculate.

Each ring has side length increasing.

The k-th ring starts at (k,-k) or something.

I recall that the bottom-right corner of each layer is an odd square.

For example, ring 0: just 1, which is 1^2.

Ring 1: from 2 to 9, ends at 9=3^2.

Ring 2: from 10 to 25=5^2.

Ring 3: from 26 to 49=7^2.

And so on. So the n-th ring, for n>=1, starts at (2n-1)^2 + 1 and ends at (2n+1)^2.

Set k as the ring index.

Let k be the step, starting from 0.

Center: k=0, numbers 1 to 1, which is (1)^2.

First ring: k=1, numbers 2 to 9 = 3^2.

Second ring: k=2, numbers 10 to 25=5^2.

Third ring: k=3, numbers 26 to 49=7^2.

So the k-th ring ends at (2k+1)^2.

For k=0, (1)^2=1, correct.

k=1, 3^2=9, correct.

k=2,5^2=25, correct.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

The first number of ring k is the number after (2k-1)^2, so (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=1, (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1^2+1=2, correct.

k=2, 3^2+1=10, correct.

k=3,5^2+1=26, correct.

The side length of ring k: since it goes around, each side has how many numbers.

For ring k, it starts at (2k-1)^2 +1 and ends at (2k+1)^2.

The number of numbers in ring k: [(2k+1)^2] - [(2k-1)^2] = (4k^2 + 4k +1) - (4k^2 -4k +1) = 8k.

Yes, as expected, 8k numbers for ring k.

For k=1, 8 numbers, yes.

k=2,16 numbers? 25-10+1=16, yes 8*2=16.

k=3,49-26+1=24, 8*3=24, good.

Now, the position of each number.

The ring k starts at position (k, -k) or something? Let's see.

From earlier: for k=1, starts at 2, which is at (1,0)? Earlier I had (1,0) for 2.

But (1,0), and k=1, so perhaps (k, -(k-1)) or something.

Standard way: the ring k starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1, (1,0), yes.

Then moves up to (k,k)? From (1,0) to (1,1) for 3.

Then left to (-k,k)? From (1,1) to (0,1) for 4, then to (-1,1) for 5.

Then down to (-k,-k)? From (-1,1) to (-1,0) for 6, then to (-1,-1) for 7.

Then right to (k,-k)? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1) for 8, then to (1,-1) for 9.

Then to (2,-1) for 10? But k=2 now.

For ring k=1, it ends at (1,-1), which is (k,-k) since k=1.

Then ring k=2 starts at (2,-1)? (2,-1), which is (k, -(k-1))? For k=2, (2,-1), yes.

General pattern: ring k starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1, (1,0)= (1,-0)? -(k-1)=0 for k=1.

k=2, (2,-1), yes.

k=3, should start at (3,-2).

And ends at (k+1, -k)? For k=1, ends at (2,-1)? But earlier ended at (1,-1), no.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) and ends at (k+1, -k)? For k=1, starts (1,0), ends (1,-1)? But we have (1,-1) for 9, but next ring starts at (2,-1).

Perhaps the direction.

From the start point, it moves in a direction.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) and moves in the direction: up, left, down, right? But for k=1: start (1,0), move up to (1,1), then left to (0,1), (-1,1), then down to (-1,0), (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1), (1,-1).

So it moves: up for 2 steps? From (1,0) to (1,1) — that's one step up? But only one number? Each move is to adjacent cell.

Actually, in ring k, each side has length 2k.

For k=1, each side has 2 numbers? Let's see: from start (1,0) to (1,1): one step, but only one number? Positions: start at (1,0)=2, then move up to (1,1)=3 — so that's the top side? But only two points? For ring k=1, total 8 numbers, but it's a square ring, so each side should have 2k numbers? For k=1, 2*1=2 numbers per side? But a square has four sides, so 8 numbers, each side has 2 numbers? But in a grid, a side of length l has l points, but for a ring, it's the perimeter.

For a square from (k,k) to (k,-k) etc., but let's define the bounding box.

For ring k, the min x is -k, max x is k, min y is -k, max y is k? For k=1, min x=-1, max x=1, min y=-1, max y=1, yes.

The ring consists of all points where max(|x|,|y|) = k? For k=1, points where max(|x|,|y|)=1, which are (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1), but missing corners? (1,1), etc.

max(|x|,|y|)=k means the outermost points, but for a ring, it should be the points on the perimeter.

For a square of side 2k+1, centered at origin, the perimeter points.

The square from x=-k to k, y=-k to k, but the perimeter is when |x|=k or |y|=k, but not both? No, corners are included.

The set of points where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For k=1, max(|x|,|y|)=1: so |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both less, so includes (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1). Exactly 8 points, yes.

And the order is: starting at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1, (1,0).

Then moves: first up: increasing y, until (k,k).

From (1,0) to (1,1): y increases from 0 to 1.

Then left: decreasing x, from (1,1) to (-1,1): x from 1 to -1.

Then down: decreasing y, from (-1,1) to (-1,-1): y from 1 to -1.

Then right: increasing x, from (-1,-1) to (1,-1): x from -1 to 1.

But it ends at (1,-1), not back to start.

For k=1, from (1,0) up to (1,1), left to (-1,1), down to (-1,-1), right to (1,-1).

Now for k=2, starts at (2,-1)? Earlier we said (k, -(k-1)) = (2,-1) for k=2.

Then move up: increasing y, from y=-1 to y=2? But max(|x|,|y|) for ring k=2 is max=2.

So from (2,-1), move up to (2,0),(2,1),(2,2)? But that's three steps? Each direction has how many steps.

In ring k, each side has 2k segments? Number of moves.

From start to end of a side.

For example, in k=1, up side: from (1,0) to (1,1): one step, but two points: (1,0) and (1,1). So the side has 2 points, which is 2k for k=1? 2*1=2, yes.

Left side: from (1,1) to (-1,1): points (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1)? Three points? But for k=1, left side should have two points? Earlier: from (1,1) to (-1,1), but with intermediate point? In our path: after (1,1), next is (0,1), then (-1,1), so yes, three points: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1). But 2k=2, not 3. Inconsistency.

I see, I miscounted. For ring k=1, the points are:

- Top side: but it's not a full side.

The movement: from start (k, -(k-1)) = (1,0) for k=1.

Then move up: to (1,1). So positions: (1,0) and (1,1). Two points for the "up" segment? But (1,0) is start, (1,1) is next.

Then move left: from (1,1) to (0,1), then to (-1,1). So points (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1). Three points? But (1,1) is shared.

In terms of cells, each cell is visited once.

The path is: start at (1,0), then to (1,1), then to (0,1), then to (-1,1), then to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1), then to (0,-1), then to (1,-1).

So the sequence of moves:

- From (1,0) to (1,1): move up, y increases by 1.

- From (1,1) to (0,1): move left, x decreases by 1.

- From (0,1) to (-1,1): move left, x decreases by 1.

- From (-1,1) to (-1,0): move down, y decreases by 1.

- From (-1,0) to (-1,-1): move down, y decreases by 1.

- From (-1,-1) to (0,-1): move right, x increases by 1.

- From (0,-1) to (1,-1): move right, x increases by 1.

So the segments:

- Up: 1 move, 2 points? From (1,0) to (1,1): one move, two points.

- Left: two moves: to (0,1) and to (-1,1), so three points: start (1,1), end (-1,1), with (0,1) in between.

- Down: two moves: to (-1,0) and to (-1,-1), three points: (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1).

- Right: two moves: to (0,-1) and to (1,-1), three points: (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1).

But total points: up:2, left:3, down:3, right:3? But 2+3+3+3=11, but we have only 8 points, and start is shared.

The points are: (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1). That's 8 points.

The segments:

- Up: from (1,0) to (1,1): this is the first segment, but it's only one step, and it's not a full side.

For ring k, the "up" segment has k steps? For k=1, up segment has 1 step: from (1,0) to (1,1).

Then left segment has 2 steps: from (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1).

Then down segment has 2 steps: from (-1,1) to (-1,0) to (-1,-1).

Then right segment has 2 steps: from (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1).

But total steps: 1+2+2+2=7, but 8 points, so the start is not counted in moves, or something.

The number of moves per direction:

- First direction: up, with 1 move (for k=1)

- Second direction: left, with 2 moves

- Third: down, with 2 moves

- Fourth: right, with 2 moves

Total moves: 1+2+2+2=7 moves, but 8 points, so the first point is extra.

Generally, for ring k, the number of moves in each direction:

- Up: k moves? But for k=1, we have only 1 for up.

- Left: 2k-1? 2*1-1=1, but we have 2 for left.

I recall that for ring k, it has:

- Move up: k steps? But for k=1, up has 1 step, which is correct for that segment.

After start, it moves up for k steps? For k=1, from (1,0) move up to (1,1), so one step, yes.

Then move left for 2k-1 steps? For k=1, 2*1-1=1, but we moved two steps left? From (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), that's two moves, two steps.

Perhaps it's move up for k steps, but each "step" is to an adjacent cell, so number of cells in the segment is number of moves +1.

To avoid confusion, let's define the length of each side.

For ring k, the "up" side has k+1 points? For k=1, up side has 2 points: (1,0) and (1,1).

Left side has 3 points: (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1).

But (1,1) is shared.

The total number of points is 8k, and it's divided into four sides, but the corners are shared, so each side has 2k points, including corners.

For k=1, each side should have 2*1=2 points? But as above, if up side has (1,0),(1,1), left side has (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), so left side has three points, but (1,1) is corner.

In a square grid, for a ring at distance k, the perimeter consists of 8k points, and it can be divided into four sides, each with 2k points, but since corners are shared, each side has 2k points, with corners counted in both, but in the path, when we traverse, we visit each point once.

For ring k, the side lengths in terms of number of cells:

- East side: from (k, -k+1) to (k,k)? Let's think.

From the start point (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k).

For k=1, (1,0).

Then:

- Move up: y from 1-k to k, so y increases from 1-k to k.

Number of steps: from y=1-k to y=k, so delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1? For k=1, delta y=1-0=1, but number of moves is 1, number of points is 2.

The number of points in this segment is the number of y-values from 1-k to k inclusive, which is k - (1-k) + 1 = 2k.

For k=1, 2*1=2 points: y=0 and y=1.

For k=2, y from 1-2= -1 to 2, so y=-1,0,1,2, four points, 2k=4.

Then next segment: move left, x from k to -k.

x decreases from k to -k.

Number of x-values: from k down to -k, inclusive, so k - (-k) +1 = 2k+1.

For k=1, 2*1+1=3 points: x=1,0,-1.

For k=2, x=2,1,0,-1,-2, five points, 2k+1=5.

But earlier for up segment it was 2k points, for left it's 2k+1? That can't be, because total should be 8k.

For k=1, up:2 points, left:3 points, down:3 points, right:3 points? 2+3+3+3=11 >8.

I see the problem: the start point is included in the first segment, and the corner is shared.

In the up segment, it includes the start and the top-right corner.

Then left segment includes the top-right corner and top-left corner, so corner is counted twice.

To fix this, in the path, the corners are visited only once, so the segments between corners have length.

For ring k, there are four corners: (k,k), ( -k,k), (-k,-k), (k,-k).

The sides between them:

- From (k,1-k) to (k,k): this is the right side? No.

For the up segment: from (k,1-k) to (k,k), which is moving up along x=k.

Number of points: y from 1-k to k inclusive.

Number of integers from 1-k to k is k - (1-k) +1 = 2k, as before.

But for k=1, y=0 to 1, points (1,0),(1,1).

Then from (k,k) to (-k,k): moving left along y=k.

x from k to -k, number of points: x=k to x=-k, inclusive, difference in x is -2k, number is |k - (-k)| +1 = 2k+1.

For k=1, x=1 to -1, points (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1) — three points.

But (1,1) is already included in the first segment.

So in the path, when we go from (k,1-k) to (k,k), we have points with x=k, y=1-k to k.

Then from (k,k) to (-k,k), but (k,k) is already visited, so we start from there to (-k,k), so points with y=k, x=k-1 down to x=-k.

So for the left segment, x from k-1 down to -k, so x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k.

Number of points: from x=k-1 to x= -k, number is (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1, x=0 to -1? k-1=0, down to -1, so x=0,-1, points (0,1),(-1,1) — two points, but earlier we had three including (1,1), but if we start from x=k-1, then for k=1, x=0 to -1, points (0,1),(-1,1), so two points, and (1,1) is already covered.

Then from (-k,k) to (-k,-k): moving down along x= -k, y from k to -k.

But y=k is already visited, so y from k-1 down to -k.

Number of points: y=k-1 to -k, number (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1, y=0 to -1, points (-1,0),(-1,-1).

Then from (-k,-k) to (k,-k): moving right along y= -k, x from -k to k.

y= -k, x from -k to k, but (-k,-k) already visited, so x from -k+1 to k.

Number of points: x= -k+1 to k, number k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1 = 2k.

For k=1, x=0 to 1, points (0,-1),(1,-1).

Then finally, from (k,-k) back, but in this case, for ring k, after this, it should be at (k,-k), but for k=1, we end at (1,-1), which is correct.

Total points: up segment: 2k points? For k=1, 2 points: (1,0),(1,1)

Left segment: 2k points? For k=1, 2 points: (0,1),(-1,1)? But we have only two, but earlier we had three including (1,1), but now it's only (0,1),(-1,1), so total so far: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1)

Then down segment: 2k=2 points: (-1,0),(-1,-1)

Then right segment: 2k=2 points: (0,-1),(1,-1)

Total: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1) — perfect, 8 points.

And for up segment, it has 2k points, but for k=1, it's 2, which includes the start and the first corner.

For left segment, it has 2k points, from (k,k) to (-k,k), but excluding the first point (k,k), so it's the next 2k points? For k=1, 2 points: (0,1),(-1,1), which is correct.

In general, for ring k:

- Start at (k, 1-k)

- Move up: to (k,k), visiting all points with x=k, y from 1-k to k. Number of points: as calculated, 2k.

y from 1-k to k inclusive, number is k - (1-k) + 1 = 2k.

- Then move left: to (-k,k), visiting all points with y=k, x from k-1 down to -k. So x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k. Number of x: from k-1 to -k, step -1, number is (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = 2k.

- Then move down: to (-k,-k), visiting all points with x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k. y=k-1, k-2, ..., -k. Number: (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = 2k.

- Then move right: to (k,-k), visiting all points with y=-k, x from -k+1 to k. x=-k+1, -k+2, ..., k. Number: k - (-k+1) + 1 = 2k.

Total points: 2k + 2k + 2k + 2k = 8k, perfect.

And the sequence is in this order.

Now, the number assigned: ring k starts at number s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Ends at e_k = (2k+1)^2.

Now, within the ring, the numbers increase as we traverse.

For ring k, we have four segments, each with 2k points.

The segments are:

1. Up: from (k,1-k) to (k,k), y increasing.

2. Left: from (k,k) to (-k,k), x decreasing.

3. Down: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k), y decreasing.

4. Right: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k), x increasing.

Each segment has exactly 2k points.

The starting number for ring k is s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Then, the first segment (up) has the first 2k numbers: from s_k to s_k + 2k - 1.

For example, k=1: s_k=2, first segment: points (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3. So numbers 2 and 3, which is s_k to s_k + 2k -1 = 2 to 2+2-1=3, yes.

Then second segment (left): starts at (k,k)=(1,1), but number next is 4. So from s_k + 2k = 2 + 2 =4.

Points: (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5. Numbers 4 and 5.

s_k + 2k to s_k + 4k -1? s_k + 2k =4, to s_k + 4k -1=2+4-1=5, yes.

Then third segment (down): starts at (-k,k)=(-1,1), number next is 6. s_k + 4k? 2+4=6.

Points: (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7. Numbers 6,7.

s_k + 4k to s_k + 6k -1=2+6-1=7, yes.

Then fourth segment (right): starts at (-k,-k)=(-1,-1), number next is 8. s_k + 6k=2+6=8.

Points: (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9. Numbers 8,9.

s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k -1=2+8-1=9, yes.

Perfect.

So general: for ring k, segment:

1. Up: numbers from s_k to s_k + 2k - 1

2. Left: s_k + 2k to s_k + 4k - 1

3. Down: s_k + 4k to s_k + 6k - 1

4. Right: s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k - 1

And positions as above.

Now, I need to find where 2026 is.

First, find which ring it is in.

That is, find k such that the ring starts at s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1 and ends at e_k = (2k+1)^2.

So s_k <= 2026 <= e_k.

s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

e_k = (2k+1)^2

Find k where s_k <= 2026 <= e_k.

Since e_k = (2k+1)^2, and s_k = e_{k-1} + 1? e_{k-1} = (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2, so s_k = e_{k-1} + 1 = (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Now, solve for k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2k+1)^2? Since s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1, and e_k = (2k+1)^2.

Actually, 2026 >= s_k and 2026 <= e_k.

But s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1, so (2k-1)^2 < 2026, since s_k > (2k-1)^2.

Similarly, e_k = (2k+1)^2 >= 2026.

So find smallest m such that m^2 >= 2026, and m is odd, since the corners are odd squares.

e_k = (2k+1)^2, so let m = 2k+1, odd.

Find smallest odd m such that m^2 >= 2026.

Compute sqrt(2026).

45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

45^2=2025 < 2026, 46^2=2116 > 2026.

But 45 is odd, and e_k = m^2 for m=2k+1 odd.

For m=45, e_k =45^2=2025, but s_k for that ring? If m=2k+1=45, then k=22, e_k=45^2=2025.

s_k = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

So ring k=22: numbers from 1850 to 2025.

But 2026 is greater than 2025, so not in this ring.

Next ring k=23? m=2k+1=2*23+1=47, e_k=47^2=2209.

s_k=(2*23-1)^2 +1=(46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Exactly s_k=2026.

So for k=23, s_k=2026.

Now, where is it? s_k is the start of the ring, which is at position (k, 1-k) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

And it is the first number of the ring, so it is in the first segment, the "up" segment.

Now, the "up" segment goes from (k,1-k) to (k,k), with numbers from s_k to s_k + 2k -1.

Here s_k=2026, k=23.

So numbers: 2026 to 2026 + 2*23 -1 = 2026 + 46 -1 = 2026 +45=2071.

The segment has 2k=46 points.

Numbers: s_k to s_k + 2k -1 =2026 to 2026+45=2071? 2026 + 45 =2071, yes, since 2k-1=46-1=45.

The position: starts at (k,1-k)=(23,-22)

Then moves up, increasing y, while x fixed at k=23.

So y starts at 1-k= -22, and goes up to k=23.

The y-coordinates: from y= -22 to y=23, inclusive? But number of points: from y=-22 to y=23, that's 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46, yes.

The number increases as we move up, so as y increases.

Specifically, for a given number in this segment, it is at (23, y), and the number n satisfies n = s_k + (y - (1-k)) 

Since when y=1-k, n=s_k.

When y increases by 1, n increases by 1.

So n = s_k + [y - (1-k)] 

Since s_k = (2k-1)^2 +1, but we have k=23, s_k=2026.

So n = 2026 + [y - (1-23)] = 2026 + [y - (-22)] = 2026 + y + 22 = y + 2048.

Let me compute.

y - (1-k) = y - (1-23) = y - (-22) = y + 22.

So n = s_k + (y + 22) = 2026 + y + 22 = y + 2048.

Since n=2026 at y=-22, so n - 2026 = y - (-22) = y + 22.

So y = (n - 2026) - 22? From n = 2026 + (y + 22)

So y = n - 2026 - 22 = n - 2048.

For n=2026, y=2026 - 2048 = -22, correct.

For n=2027, y=2027-2048=-21, and so on.

But in this case, for n=2026, y=2026 - 2048 = -22.

x is fixed at k=23.

So position is (23, -22).

Now, I need the eight neighbors of this position.

In a grid, the eight neighbors are all cells adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

So for a cell (x,y), neighbors are:

(x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1), (x,y+1), (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x+1,y+1).

But in this spiral, not all neighbors may be occupied by numbers, but since the spiral covers all integers, and we go outwards, but for a given cell, its neighbors might be in different rings, but since the spiral is infinite and fills all integer coordinates, every cell has neighbors, but some might not be filled if they are outside, but actually, the spiral fills all integer coordinates in the plane, since it goes on forever.

Is that true? For example, at (0,0), neighbors include (-1,0), which is occupied by 6 in ring1, etc. And as we go out, all integer coordinates are eventually filled, and for any cell, its neighbors are also filled, since the grid is fully populated.

Is that correct? For example, consider a cell on the ring, say (1,0) which is 2. Its neighbors: (0,0)=1, (2,0) but (2,0) is in ring2, which is 11? Earlier for ring2, starts at (2,-1)=10, then up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, etc. So yes, (2,0)=11, which is filled. Similarly, (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8, (2,1)=12? (x+1,y+1)=(2,1), which is in ring2, yes. So all eight neighbors are filled.

Similarly, for any point, since the spiral covers all integer coordinates, and neighbors are adjacent, they will be filled, possibly in a different ring.

So for (23,-22), the eight neighbors are:

(22,-22), (24,-22), (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23), (22,-21), (24,-23), (24,-21).

Now, I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since I need the sum, I could compute each one, but that might be tedious. Perhaps there is a pattern or a better way.

Notice that the point (23,-22) is on the ring k=23, specifically at the start of the up segment.

The neighbors might be in ring 22, 23, or 24.

Ring 22: k=22, max |x|,|y|=22.

Ring 23: max=23.

Ring 24: max=24.

Now, for (23,-22), max(|x|,|y|)=max(23,22)=23, so it is on ring 23, as we know.

Now, neighbors:

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, so on ring 22.

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, so on ring 24.

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, same ring.

- (23,-21): max(23,21)=23, same ring.

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, same ring.

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22? 22>21, so max=22, ring 22.

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24.

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, ring 24.

So, neighbors on ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

On ring 23: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23)? (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, yes ring 23.

List:

- (22,-22): max=22, ring 22

- (22,-21): max=22? |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, ring 22

- (24,-22): max=24, ring 24

- (24,-21): max=24, ring 24

- (24,-23): max=24, ring 24

- (23,-23): max=23, ring 23

- (23,-21): max=23, ring 23

- (22,-23): max=23, ring 23

And (23,-22) itself is not included.

So neighbors: ring 22: two points: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Ring 23: four points? (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23), and missing one? (24,-22) is ring 24, not 23.

The points on ring 23: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23), and what about (24,-22)? max=24>23, so ring 24.

But earlier list: (22,-23), (23,-23), (23,-21), and (22,-21) is ring 22.

So only three points on ring 23? But should be symmetric? Perhaps I missed one.

The neighbors are eight, I listed all:

1. (22,-22) ring 22

2. (24,-22) ring 24

3. (23,-23) ring 23

4. (23,-21) ring 23

5. (22,-23) ring 23

6. (22,-21) ring 22? Earlier I said ring 22, but |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, yes ring 22.

7. (24,-23) ring 24

8. (24,-21) ring 24

So indeed:

- Ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

- Ring 23: (22,-23), (23,-23), (23,-21) — three points? But (23,-21) is listed, and (22,-23), (23,-23)

Is there a fourth? What about (24,-22)? That's ring 24.

But (23,-22) is the point itself, not neighbor.

So neighbors include three on ring 23, two on ring 22, three on ring 24.

But ring 23 has max=23, so points where max(|x|,|y|)=23.

(22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, yes.

(23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23.

(23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23.

Is there (24,-23)? |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24>23, so ring 24.

Similarly, (23,-22) itself is |x|=23, |y|=22, max=23, but it's not a neighbor.

So yes, only three neighbors on ring 23.

Similarly, ring 22: max=22, so (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22.

(22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22.

(21,-22) would be max=22, but it's not a neighbor; neighbors are only adjacent, so (22,-22) and (22,-21) are neighbors, but (21,-22) is not adjacent; it's diagonal? No, (21,-22) is diagonally adjacent? Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=0? No, from (23,-22) to (21,-22) is dx=2, dy=0, not adjacent.

Adjacent cells are those differing by at most 1 in each coordinate, but not both zero.

So for (23,-22), neighbors are:

- Same row: (22,-22), (24,-22)

- Same column: (23,-23), (23,-21)

- Diagonals: (22,-23), (22,-21), (24,-23), (24,-21)

All covered.

Now, among these, (22,-22) and (22,-21) have max(|x|,|y|)=22 (since |x|=22, |y|=22 or 21, both max=22), so ring 22.

(24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21) all have |x|=24 or |y|=24? (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24.

(24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24.

(24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24. So all ring 24.

(22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23.

(23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23.

(23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23, ring 23.

So yes: two on ring 22, three on ring 23, three on ring 24.

Now, I need to find the numbers at these positions.

First, for ring 22: k=22.

s_k = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

e_k = (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

Now, points: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Now, need to find which segment they are in and the number.

First, for a point (x,y) on ring k=22, max(|x|,|y|)=22.

Now, depending on the segment.

Recall the segments:

- Up: x=k=22, y from 1-k=1-22=-21 to k=22.

So y from -21 to 22.

And in this segment, x=22, fixed.

Now, our points: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Now, y=-22 and y=-21.

Now, in the up segment, y from -21 to 22.

So y=-21 is included, but y=-22 is not? y min is -21.

But max(|x|,|y|)=22, so for (22,-22), |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, so it should be on the ring.

But in the up segment, y starts at -21, not -22.

Where is (22,-22)? Probably in another segment.

The segments:

- Up: x=22, y from -21 to 22. So y >= -21.

- Then left: y=22, x from k-1=21 down to -k=-22. So x from 21 to -22.

- Then down: x=-22, y from k-1=21 down to -k=-22. So y from 21 to -22.

- Then right: y=-22, x from -k+1=-21 to k=22. So x from -21 to 22.

Now, our points: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

(22,-21): x=22, y=-21.

In the up segment, x=22, y from -21 to 22, so y=-21 is the start? The start is (k,1-k)=(22,1-22)=(22,-21), yes, exactly the start of the ring.

So for ring k=22, start at (22,-21), with number s_k=1850.

Now, (22,-22): x=22, y=-22.

Now, y=-22, which is not in up segment (y>=-21), not in left (y=22), not in down (x=-22), but in right segment: y=-22, x from -21 to 22.

So yes, in the right segment.

The right segment: starts after down segment, at (-k,-k)=(-22,-22), then moves right to (k,-k)=(22,-22).

Numbers: for ring k, right segment: numbers from s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k -1.

s_k=1850, k=22.

s_k + 6k =1850 + 6*22=1850+132=1982

s_k + 8k -1=1850 + 176 -1=1850+175=2025? 8*22=176, 176-1=175, 1850+175=2025, yes, ends at 2025.

Now, the segment: starts at (-22,-22), number s_k + 6k =1982.

Then moves right, increasing x, y fixed at -22.

x from -22 to 22? But starts at x=-22, then to x=-21, ..., up to x=22.

But the first point is (-22,-22), then next is (-21,-22), etc., up to (22,-22).

Number of points: x from -22 to 22, inclusive? But earlier we said x from -k+1 to k? For k=22, x from -21 to 22? Earlier general: for right segment, x from -k+1 to k.

k=22, x from -21 to 22? But that would be from -21 to 22, which is 22 - (-21) +1=44, but should be 2k=44, yes.

But it starts at (-22,-22)? Contradiction.

In the path: after down segment, ends at (-k,-k)=(-22,-22).

Then move right: to (-21,-22), then (-20,-22), ..., up to (22,-22).

So the points are: (-22,-22), (-21,-22), ..., (22,-22).

x from -22 to 22, inclusive.

Number of points: 22 - (-22) +1 = 44 +1=45? But 2k=44 for k=22.

Mistake.

Earlier for general k, in right segment: x from -k+1 to k.

For k=22, x from -21 to 22.

But (-22,-22) is included? In this segment, it starts at (-22,-22), but according to formula, x from -21 to 22.

Inconsistency.

Recall for k=1: right segment: starts at (-k,-k)=(-1,-1), then moves right to (0,-1), then (1,-1). So points (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1). So x from -1 to 1? But according to formula, x from -k+1 to k = -1+1=0 to 1? So x=0,1? But missing (-1,-1).

Problem.

In k=1, right segment: numbers s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k -1 = 2 + 6*1 =8? Earlier we had 8 and 9.

Points: (-1,-1)=7? No, earlier: down segment ended at (-1,-1)=7, then right segment: (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

So starts at (0,-1)=8, ends at (1,-1)=9.

But (-1,-1) is in down segment.

So for right segment, it starts at (-k+1, -k) = (-1+1, -1)=(0,-1) for k=1.

Similarly, for general k, right segment: starts at (-k+1, -k), ends at (k, -k).

Points: x from -k+1 to k, y=-k.

For k=1: x from 0 to 1, y=-1: (0,-1),(1,-1), numbers 8,9.

For k=22: starts at (-22+1, -22)=(-21,-22), ends at (22,-22).

x from -21 to 22, inclusive.

Number of points: 22 - (-21) +1 = 22+21+1=44, yes 2k=44.

Numbers: from s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k -1 =1850 + 132 =1982 to 1850 + 176 -1=2025? s_k +8k -1=1850+176-1=2025, yes.

The number increases as x increases.

At x=-21, n= s_k + 6k =1982

Then as x increases, n increases.

When x increases by 1, n increases by 1.

So n = s_k + 6k + (x - (-k+1)) 

For k=22, n = 1850 + 132 + (x - (-21)) = 1982 + (x + 21)

Since at x=-21, n=1982.

So n = 1982 + x + 21 = x + 2003.

Now, our point is (22,-22)

So x=22, y=-22.

n = 22 + 2003 = 2025.

Which is the end of the ring, correct, since (22,-22) is the last point of ring 22.

Now, the other point: (22,-21)

As we said, it is the start of ring 22, at (22,-21), which is the first point of the up segment.

For up segment: starts at (k,1-k)=(22,-21), number s_k=1850.

Then as y increases, n increases.

n = s_k + (y - (1-k)) = 1850 + (y - (-21)) = 1850 + y + 21 = y + 1871.

At y=-21, n= -21 + 1871=1850, correct.

So for (22,-21), y=-21, n= -21 + 1871 = 1850.

Exactly the start.

Now, next, neighbors on ring 23: (22,-23), (23,-23), (23,-21)

And on ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21)

First, ring 23: k=23, s_k=2026, as we know.

Points: (22,-23), (23,-23), (23,-21)

Now, find which segment each is in.

Ring k=23:

- Up segment: x=23, y from 1-k=1-23=-22 to k=23. So y from -22 to 23.

- Left segment: y=23, x from k-1=22 down to -k=-23. So x from 22 to -23.

- Down segment: x=-23, y from k-1=22 down to -k=-23. So y from 22 to -23.

- Right segment: y=-23, x from -k+1=-22 to k=23. So x from -22 to 23.

Now, our points:

- (23,-21): x=23, y=-21.

In up segment? x=23, y from -22 to 23, so y=-21 is within -22 to 23, yes.

So in up segment.

- (23,-23): x=23, y=-23.

y=-23, which is less than -22? min y in up segment is -22, so not in up.

Left segment: y=23, not -23.

Down segment: x=-23, but here x=23, not -23.

Right segment: y=-23, x from -22 to 23, so yes, since x=23 is within range.

So (23,-23) is in right segment.

- (22,-23): x=22, y=-23.

Now, up: x=23, not 22.

Left: y=23, not -23.

Down: x=-23, not 22.

Right: y=-23, x from -22 to 23, so x=22 is within -22 to 23? -22 to 23 inclusive, yes, x=22 is included.

So in right segment.

Both (23,-23) and (22,-23) are in the right segment? But they are adjacent.

Now, the right segment: starts at (-k+1, -k)=(-22,-23)? k=23, -k+1=-22, -k=-23, so (-22,-23)

Ends at (k,-k)=(23,-23)

Points: x from -22 to 23, y=-23.

Numbers: right segment: from s_k + 6k to s_k + 8k -1

s_k=2026, k=23

s_k + 6k =2026 + 138=2164? 6*23=138, 2026+138=2164

s_k + 8k -1=2026 + 184 -1=2026+183=2209? 8*23=184, 184-1=183, 2026+183=2209.

e_k=(2k+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes.

The segment starts at (-22,-23), number s_k + 6k=2164

Then moves right, increasing x, y fixed at -23.

So n increases with x.

n = s_k + 6k + (x - (-k+1)) = 2164 + (x - (-22)) = 2164 + (x + 22) = x + 2186.

At x=-22, n=-22+2186=2164, correct.

Now, our points:

First, (23,-23): x=23, y=-23

n=23 + 2186=2209.

Which is the end of the ring, correct.

Second, (22,-23): x=22, y=-23

n=22 + 2186=2208.

Now, third point: (23,-21)

This is in the up segment.

Up segment: x=23, y from -22 to 23.

Starts at (23,-22), number s_k=2026.

Then as y increases, n increases.

n = s_k + (y - (1-k)) = 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22 = y + 2048.

Same as earlier for the point itself.

At y=-21, n= -21 + 2048 = 2027.

Now, finally, the neighbors on ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21)

Ring k=24, s_k = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

e_k = (2*24 +1)^2=49^2=2401.

Now, points: all have x=24, y=-22,-23,-21.

Now, max(|x|,|y|)=max(24,22)=24, max(24,23)=24, max(24,21)=24, all on ring 24.

Now, segments:

- Up: x=24, y from 1-k=1-24=-23 to k=24. So y from -23 to 24.

- Left: y=24, x from k-1=23 down to -k=-24. x from 23 to -24.

- Down: x=-24, y from k-1=23 down to -k=-24. y from 23 to -24.

- Right: y=-24, x from -k+1=-23 to k=24. x from -23 to 24.

Our points: (24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21)

All have x=24, so must be in the up segment or right segment? Up segment has x=24, right has y=-24, but here y=-22,-23,-21, not -24.

So only possible in up segment, since x=24 and y varies.

Up segment: x=24, y from -23 to 24.

So y=-23,-22,-21 are all within -23 to 24? -23 >= -23, -22>-23, -21>-23, and all less than 24, so yes, all in up segment.

Now, in up segment, starts at (k,1-k)=(24,-23), number s_k=2210.

Then n increases with y.

n = s_k + (y - (1-k)) = 2210 + (y - (-23)) = 2210 + y + 23 = y + 2233.

At y=-23, n=-23+2233=2210, correct.

Now, for each point:

- (24,-23): y=-23, n= -23 + 2233 = 2210

- (24,-22): y=-22, n= -22 + 2233 = 2211

- (24,-21): y=-21, n= -21 + 2233 = 2212

Now, we have all neighbors' numbers.

List them:

1. Ring 22: (22,-22): we have n=2025 (as end of ring)

Earlier: for (22,-22), in right segment, n=x + 2003, x=22, n=22+2003=2025, yes.

2. Ring 22: (22,-21): start of ring, n=1850

3. Ring 23: (22,-23): in right segment, n=x + 2186, x=22, n=22+2186=2208

4. Ring 23: (23,-23): in right segment, n=23+2186=2209

5. Ring 23: (23,-21): in up segment, n=y + 2048, y=-21, n=-21+2048=2027

6. Ring 24: (24,-22): in up segment, n=y + 2233, y=-22, n=-22+2233=2211

7. Ring 24: (24,-23): y=-23, n=-23+2233=2210

8. Ring 24: (24,-21): y=-21, n=-21+2233=2212

Now, list all numbers:

- 2025 (from (22,-22))

- 1850 (from (22,-21))

- 2208 (from (22,-23))

- 2209 (from (23,-23))

- 2027 (from (23,-21))

- 2211 (from (24,-22))

- 2210 (from (24,-23))

- 2212 (from (24,-21))

Now, sum them up.

List them: 2025, 1850, 2208, 2209, 2027, 2211, 2210, 2212.

Now, sum.

Notice that some are consecutive or close.

Group them.

First, the ring 22 neighbors: 2025 and 1850.

1850 is small, 2025 is large.

1850 + 2025 = 3875.

Then ring 23 neighbors: 2208, 2209, 2027.

2027 is smaller.

2208 + 2209 = 4417.

Then 4417 + 2027 = 6444.

2027 + 2208 = 4235, plus 2209=6444, yes.

Then ring 24 neighbors: 2211, 2210, 2212.

2210 + 2211 + 2212.

Note they are consecutive: 2210,2211,2212.

Sum = 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 3 * 2211 = 6633? Since average is 2211.

2210 + 2212 = 4422, plus 2211=6633, yes.

Now, total sum: ring22 + ring23 + ring24 = 3875 + 6444 + 6633.

First, 3875 + 6444.

3875 + 6400 = 10275, plus 44=10319? Better: 3875 + 6444.

5+4=9, 70+40=110, carry 11? Better: 3875 + 6444.

Add: 5+4=9, 7+4=11, carry 1, 8+4+1=13, carry 1, 3+6+1=10. So 10319.

3875 + 6444: 3000+6000=9000, 875+444=1319, total 9000+1319=10319.

Now add 6633: 10319 + 6633.

19+33=52, carry 5? 10319 + 6633.

9+3=12, carry 1

1+3+1=5

3+6=9

0+6=6

1+0=1? Digits: 10319 + 6633.

Align:

  10319

+  6633

------

Start from right: 9+3=12, write 2, carry 1

1+3+1=5, write 5

3+6=9, write 9

0+6=6, write 6

1+0=1, write 1? 10319 has five digits, 6633 has four, so:

  10319

+  6633

------

From right: units: 9+3=12, write 2, carry 1

Tens: 1+3+1=5, write 5

Hundreds: 3+6=9, write 9

Thousands: 0+6=6, write 6

Ten thousands: 1+0=1, write 1.

So 16952.

10319 + 6633.

10319 + 6000=16319, +633=16319+600=16919, +33=16919+30=16949, +3=16952. Yes.

So sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the list again.

Neighbors:

1. (22,-22): 2025

2. (22,-21): 1850

3. (22,-23): 2208

4. (23,-23): 2209

5. (23,-21): 2027

6. (24,-22): 2211

7. (24,-23): 2210

8. (24,-21): 2212

Now sum: let me add step by step.

Add sequentially:

Start with 2025 + 1850 = 3875

+2208 = 3875 + 2200 = 6075, +8=6083? 3875 + 2208.

75+8=83, 3800+2200=6000, total 6083? But earlier I had 10319 for ring22 and ring23, but ring22 is 3875, ring23 is 2208+2209+2027.

2208+2209=4417, +2027=4417+2000=6417, +27=6444, yes.

3875 + 6444=10319, as before.

Now +2211 (from (24,-22)) =10319 + 2211=12530

10319 + 2000=12319, +211=12319+200=12519, +11=12530.

Then +2210 (from (24,-23)) =12530 + 2210=14740

12530 + 2000=14530, +210=14740.

Then +2212 (from (24,-21)) =14740 + 2212=16952.

Same as before.

Notice that the numbers are: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

1850 and 2025 are smaller, others larger.

Sum all: let me compute pairwise.

1850 + 2025 = 3875

2027 + 2212 = 4239? 2027+2200=4227, +12=4239

2208 + 2211 = 4419

2209 + 2210 = 4419

Now sum these: 3875, 4239, 4419, 4419.

First, 3875 + 4239 = 3875 + 4200 = 8075, +39=8114

Then 4419 + 4419 = 8838

Then 8114 + 8838 = 8114 + 8800 = 16914, +38=16952.

Same.

So sum is 16952.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a smaller example to see if the neighbor sum makes sense.

Suppose I take the center, number 1 at (0,0).

Its eight neighbors: (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=6? Earlier: (1,0)=2, (0,1)=4, (-1,0)=6, (0,-1)=8, and diagonals: (1,1)=3, (-1,1)=5, (-1,-1)=7, (1,-1)=9.

So numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= let's see, average 5.5, 8 numbers, sum=44.

Now, according to the formula, but for 1, which is ring 0, but our point is not on a ring, but neighbors are ring 1.

But in our case, for 2026, it's on ring 23, neighbors in ring 22,23,24.

But for center, it's different.

Take another point. Say, take number 2 at (1,0).

Its neighbors: eight neighbors.

(1,0) neighbors:

(0,0)=1, (2,0)=11? Earlier, ring2 starts at (2,-1)=10, so (2,0)=11.

(1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9

Diagonals: (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8, (2,1)=12, (2,-1)=10

So neighbors: 1,3,9,11,4,8,12,10.

List: (0,0)=1, (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (2,0)=11, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8, (2,1)=12, (2,-1)=10.

So numbers: 1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12.

Sum: 1+3=4, +4=8, +8=16, +9=25, +10=35, +11=46, +12=58.

Now, according to our method: for point (1,0), which is ring k=1, since max(|x|,|y|)=1.

s_k for k=1 is 2? But it's the start.

Position (1,0), which is start of ring.

Neighbors: similar to before.

(0,0): max(|x|,|y|)=0? |x|=0,|y|=0,max=0, so ring 0? But ring 0 is just (0,0)=1.

(2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring 2.

(1,1): max(1,1)=1, same ring.

(1,-1): max(1,1)=1, same ring.

(0,1): max(0,1)=1, same ring.

(0,-1): max(0,1)=1, same ring.

(2,1): max(2,1)=2, ring 2.

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ring 2.

So neighbors: ring 0: (0,0)=1

Ring 1: (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8 — four points? But earlier we have (0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1), all ring 1.

Ring 2: (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,-1)=10 — three points? But earlier we listed eight: 1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12. So ring0:1, ring1:3,4,8,9, ring2:10,11,12.

Sum:1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12= let's add: 1+12=13, 3+11=14, 4+10=14, 8+9=17, total 13+14=27, +14=41, +17=58, same as before.

In our calculation for 2026, we have two in ring22, three in ring23, three in ring24, sum 16952.

But for comparison, in this small case, sum is 58.

Now back to 2026.

We have all numbers: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Sum is 16952.

But let me confirm if the positions are correct.

The point is (23,-22), number 2026.

Its neighbors:

- Left: (22,-22): we have 2025

- Right: (24,-22): we have 2211

- Down: (23,-23): we have 2209

- Up: (23,-21): we have 2027

- Down-left: (22,-23): 2208

- Down-right: (24,-23): 2210

- Up-left: (22,-21): 1850

- Up-right: (24,-21): 2212

Now, are these consistent? For example, (22,-22) is adjacent to (23,-22), and we have 2025 and 2026, consecutive? 2025 and 2026, yes, consecutive numbers? But in the spiral, are they adjacent? Position (22,-22) and (23,-22), same y, x differs by 1, so adjacent horizontally.

Numbers: we have 2025 at (22,-22), 2026 at (23,-22), so yes, consecutive.

Similarly, (23,-21): 2027, which is next to 2026? 2026 and 2027, but position: (23,-22) and (23,-21), same x, y differs by 1, so adjacent vertically.

Numbers 2026 and 2027, consecutive, good.

Now, (22,-21): 1850, which is much smaller, but that's fine.

(24,-22): 2211, which is larger.

Now, sum is 16952.

But let me see if I can compute it differently.

Notice that some numbers are consecutive.

For example, in ring 24, we have 2210,2211,2212, which are consecutive, sum 2211*3=6633.

In ring 23, we have 2027,2208,2209.

2027 is near 2026, but others are larger.

Note that (22,-23)=2208, (23,-23)=2209, which are consecutive? 2208 and 2209, and positions adjacent, so should be consecutive if same ring and segment, which they are.

Similarly, (23,-21)=2027, which is not consecutive to them.

But anyway, we have calculated each, and sum is consistent.

Another way: the sum of neighbors.

Since the spiral is symmetric, but in this case, it's asymmetric because it's at the start of the ring.

But we have the numbers, and sum is 16952.

Now, to box the answer.

But let me confirm the sum again.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Add in pairs:

1850 + 2212 = 4062? 1850+2200=4050, +12=4062.

2025 + 2211 = 4236? 2025+2200=4225, +11=4236.

2027 + 2210 = 4237? 2027+2200=4227, +10=4237.

2208 + 2209 = 4417.

Now sum these: 4062, 4236, 4237, 4417.

Now 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654.

8298 + 8600 = 16898, +54=16952. Same.

So I think it's correct.

Thus, the sum is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral, which is the start of ring 23. The eight neighbors of this position are:

- (22, -22): number 2025 (end of ring 22)
- (22, -21): number 1850 (start of ring 22)
- (22, -23): number 2208 (in the right segment of ring 23)
- (23, -23): number 2209 (end of ring 23)
- (23, -21): number 2027 (in the up segment of ring 23)
- (24, -22): number 2211 (in the up segment of ring 24)
- (24, -23): number 2210 (in the up segment of ring 24)
- (24, -21): number 2212 (in the up segment of ring 24)

The sum of these neighbors is calculated as follows:

- 1850 + 2025 = 3875
- 2027 + 2208 = 4235
- 2209 + 2210 = 4419
- 2211 + 2212 = 4423

Adding these partial sums:
- 3875 + 4235 = 8110
- 4419 + 4423 = 8842
- 8110 + 8842 = 16952

Alternatively, summing all numbers directly:
- 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952

The sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
