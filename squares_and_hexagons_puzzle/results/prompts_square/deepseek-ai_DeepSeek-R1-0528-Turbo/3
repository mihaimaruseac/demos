<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

And I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out. It starts with 1 at the center, then 2 to the right, 3 up, 4 left, 5 left again? Looking at the grid:

It seems like from 1, it goes right to 2, then up to 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Let me sketch this out.

Assume the center is 1. Then moving right: so east is 2. Then north is 3. Then west is 4, but in the grid it's shown as 5,4,3 on top, so probably 5 is northwest or something. The grid is:

Row 1: ... 5 4 3 ... so probably positions: let's assign coordinates.

Set the center (1) at (0,0). Then 2 is to the right, so (1,0). Then 3 is above 2? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Perhaps it's moving clockwise or counterclockwise.

Standard Ulam spiral is usually counterclockwise, but let's see the sequence.

From 1, next is 2 to the east. Then 3 to the north? But if 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then north would be (1,1), but in the grid, above 1 is 3, so probably (0,1) is 3? That would make sense if after 2, it goes north to (0,1)? But (0,1) is directly above (0,0), while (1,0) is east. So from (1,0) to (0,1) is northwest, which is not adjacent. That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps it's moving in a spiral: after 1, place 2 east, then 3 north, but 3 should be adjacent to 2. So if 2 is at (1,0), then north would be (1,1). But in the grid, it shows 3 above 1, which would be (0,1). Inconsistency.

Look at the given grid:

It shows:

... 5 4 3 ... so probably this is y=1 or something.

Assume the center is (0,0) with 1.

Then directly east is 2, so (1,0)=2.

Then directly north is 3? But the grid shows above 1 is 3, so if 1 is (0,0), above would be (0,1)=3.

But if 2 is at (1,0), and 3 is at (0,1), then they are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent.

Unless it's diagonal, but neighbors are usually orthogonal and diagonal, but in this case, for the spiral path, it should be moving to adjacent cells.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the grid. The grid is:

Let me write it with coordinates.

Suppose the row with 1 and 2 is y=0. So at x=0,y=0:1, x=1,y=0:2.

Then above it, y=1, it shows 3,4,5 but not specified positions. It says "... 5 4 3 ..." so probably at y=1, x=-1? Let's see.

Typically, in Ulam spiral, after 1 (center), go right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4, left to 5? But 4 and 5 are both left? That doesn't make sense.

From the grid: it shows for y=1: 5,4,3 and below y=-1: 7,8,9? It shows "...7 8 9" below, but 8 and 9 are below 1 and 2? The grid is:

I think it's a 3x3 grid shown, but with dots indicating it extends.

So, let's list the values given:

- At some position: value 1

- To its right: 2

- Above it: 3? But it shows "5 4 3" above, so probably 3 is directly above 1, then left of 3 is 4, left of 4 is 5.

Similarly, below: "7 8 9", so below 1 is 8? Let's see: it says "...7 8 9" and below that dots, but likely 8 is below 1, 7 left of 8, 9 right of 8? But 2 is already to the right, so probably not.

The text is: " ... 5 4 3 ... " then " ... 6 1 2 ... " then " ... 7 8 9 ... " so it's three rows.

Row 1: 5,4,3 (and dots)

Row 2: 6,1,2 (and dots)

Row 3: 7,8,9 (and dots)

So, relative to 1 at center:

- East: 2

- West: 6? But 6 is in the same row, left, so west is 6.

- North: above is row 1, which has 3,4,5. Since it's directly above, probably at (0,1) is 3? But then left of 3 is 4, so at (-1,1) is 4, and left of that is 5, so (-2,1) is 5.

- South: below is row 3: 7,8,9. Directly below should be at (0,-1). Since 8 is listed between 7 and 9, and likely 8 is below 1, so (0,-1)=8, then west (left) is 7 at (-1,-1), east (right) is 9 at (1,-1).

But what about 6? 6 is in row 2, same as 1, left, so at (-1,0)=6.

Now, the sequence: start at 1 (0,0). Then 2 at (1,0). Then 3 at (0,1)? But (0,1) is not adjacent to (1,0); they are diagonal. Adjacent should be orthogonal or diagonal, but for the spiral path, it should move to an adjacent cell that is not occupied.

From (0,0) to (1,0) for 2. Then from (1,0), it should go to an adjacent cell. Possible are (1,1), (1,-1), (2,0), but not (0,0) since occupied. Typically, it goes up, so to (1,1). But in this grid, at (1,1) there is no number shown; instead, at (0,1) is 3.

Perhaps it's moving differently. Let's see the values: after 2, next is 3 at (0,1), but (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) and to (1,0)? Orthogonally, (0,1) is adjacent to (0,0) (north), and to (-1,1), etc, but not directly to (1,0); they share a diagonal, but not orthogonal adjacent. In terms of grid adjacency for path, usually we consider orthogonal neighbors for movement, but here it seems like it's moving to (0,1) from (1,0), which is not orthogonal; it's diagonal, which is not standard.

Perhaps the grid is oriented differently. Another possibility: perhaps the "above" is not directly north. Let's calculate the positions based on the values.

From the grid, we have:

- (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2

- (-1,0): 6  (since left of 1 in same row)

- (0,1): ? but row 1 has 5,4,3, and since it's above, and 3 is probably above 1 or above 2? The text says "5 4 3" and below "6 1 2", so likely 3 is directly above 2? Or above 1?

In many spirals, after 1, go right to 2, then up to 3, but 3 should be above 2, so at (1,1).

But in this grid, it shows 3 above 1, not above 2. For example, if (0,0):1, (1,0):2, then (1,1):3, but the grid shows in the row above, which would be y=1, at x=1:3, but the text has "5 4 3" so if it's left to right, then at x=0 or x=-1 it's 5 and 4.

Perhaps the coordinate system is such that x increases to the right, y increases up.

So for row y=1: values 5,4,3 from left to right, so x-coordinates: let's say x= -1,0,1 or what.

Typically, for symmetry, center at (0,0).

So at y=0: values at x= -1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2

At y=1: values at x= -2? or x= -1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But then above 1 is at (0,1), which would be 4, but the grid shows 3 above 2? Let's see: if at (1,1) is 3, at (0,1) is 4, at (-1,1) is 5.

Then at y= -1: values 7,8,9, so at ( -1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

Now, is this consistent? Let's see the sequence.

Start at (0,0):1

Then move east to (1,0):2

Then move north to (1,1):3

Then move west to (0,1):4? But in the grid, at (0,1) is 4, but then next should be west to (-1,1):5

Then move south? To (-1,0):6, which is in the grid.

Then move east? To (0,0) but occupied, so probably move south to (-1,-1):7

Then east to (0,-1):8

Then east to (1,-1):9

Then north to (1,0) but occupied, so continue north? But (1,0) is occupied, so probably turn left or something.

After 9 at (1,-1), next should be 10 at (2,-1) or to (1,0) but occupied.

Standard spiral usually goes to (2,-1) for 10, then up to (2,0) for 11, etc.

But in this grid, it only shows up to 9, so we can't see, but likely it continues.

Now, the neighbors: for example, neighbors of 1: should be all around: north (0,1):4, south (0,-1):8, east (1,0):2, west (-1,0):6, northeast (1,1):3, northwest (-1,1):5, southeast (1,-1):9, southwest (-1,-1):7.

So all eight neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Sum is 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44? But the problem is to find for 2026, but just to verify.

In the problem, it says "all 8 neighbors", and for 1, it has neighbors, but in the grid, directly north is 4? But earlier I thought it was 3, but according to this, at (0,1) is 4, not 3. But in the given grid, it shows "5 4 3" above, so if it's left to right, and assuming x increases right, then at leftmost is 5, then 4, then 3. So if y=1, and x increases right, then at x=a:5, x=a+1:4, x=a+2:3. But above (0,0) should be at x=0,y=1. If that is 4, then left is 5 at x=-1,y=1, right is 3 at x=1,y=1.

Similarly, below: at y=-1, x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9.

So neighbors of 1 at (0,0):

- N: (0,1):4

- S: (0,-1):8

- E: (1,0):2

- W: (-1,0):6

- NE: (1,1):3

- NW: (-1,1):5

- SE: (1,-1):9

- SW: (-1,-1):7

Yes, as I listed, and sum is 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

But is this correct? The grid shows above 1 is 4, but in the text it says "5 4 3" and below "6 1 2", so directly above the "1" should be the middle of "5 4 3", which is 4, yes. Similarly, directly below is middle of "7 8 9" which is 8. So yes.

Now, I need to find the neighbors of 2026. So first, I need to find the position of 2026 in this spiral.

The spiral is laid out in rings. Each "layer" or "ring" around the center.

The center is 1, which can be considered ring 0.

Then ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, which is the first ring around center. It has 8 numbers: from 2 to 9.

Then ring 2: probably 10 to 25? Let me compute.

After 9 at (1,-1), next move east? Standard is to continue south or something, but after 9, since south is occupied? At (1,-1), neighbors: east (2,-1), south (1,-2), but south might be free. Typically, when you hit a corner, you turn left.

In this spiral, after 9 at (1,-1), since it came from east (from (0,-1) to (1,-1)), and it was moving east, but now to continue, since south is free? The direction was east, and after moving east, the left turn would be north, but north is (1,0) which is occupied by 2. Standard Ulam spiral usually turns left when blocked.

Recall the path:

Start at (0,0):1

Move right (east) to (1,0):2

Move up (north) to (1,1):3

Move left (west) to (0,1):4

Move left (west) to (-1,1):5

Now, move down (south) to (-1,0):6

Move down (south) to (-1,-1):7

Move right (east) to (0,-1):8

Move right (east) to (1,-1):9

Now, at (1,-1), facing east. Next would be to (2,-1), but is it free? Yes, so move to (2,-1):10

Then, since it was moving east, and the cell in front is free, but typically, after moving to a new cell, if the left is free, it turns left? The rule is: move in the current direction; if the cell to the left (relative to direction) is free, turn left. Standard is: always turn left when possible.

After placing 9 at (1,-1), facing east. The cell to the left (relative to direction) is north, which is (1,0), but it's occupied (by 2), so cannot turn left. So continue straight to (2,-1):10

Now at (2,-1), facing east. Left is north, (2,0), which is free? Yes, so turn left to face north, and move to (2,0):11

Now at (2,0), facing north. Left is west, (1,0), occupied, so continue straight to (2,1):12

At (2,1), facing north. Left is west, (1,1), occupied (by 3), so continue to (2,2):13? But (2,1) to (2,2) is north.

But (1,1) is occupied, so yes, move to (2,2):13? But earlier at (1,1) is 3, (2,1) is 12? Let me list.

After 11 at (2,0), move north to (2,1):12

Then, facing north, left is west to (1,1), which has 3, occupied, so cannot turn left, so continue north to (2,2):13

Now at (2,2), facing north. Left is west to (1,2), free? Probably, so turn left to face west, move to (1,2):14

Then at (1,2), facing west. Left is south to (1,1), occupied, so continue west to (0,2):15

At (0,2), facing west. Left is south to (0,1), occupied (by 4), so continue to (-1,2):16

At (-1,2), facing west. Left is south to (-1,1), occupied (by 5), so continue to (-2,2):17? 

After (-1,2), next would be west to (-2,2):17? But left is south, which is free? At (-1,2), facing west, left is south to (-1,1), but (-1,1) is occupied by 5, so cannot turn left, so continue west to (-2,2):17

Then at (-2,2), facing west. Left is south to (-2,1), free? Assuming no number yet, so turn left to face south, move to (-2,1):18

Then south to (-2,0):19

Then south to (-2,-1):20

Then east? At (-2,-1), facing south. Left is east to (-1,-1), occupied (by 7), so continue south to (-2,-2):21

And so on.

But this is getting messy. To find the position of n, it's better to find which ring it's in.

The rings are concentric squares.

The center is 1, ring 0.

Ring k (k>=1) consists of numbers from (2k-1)^2 + 1 to (2k+1)^2.

For k=0: only 1, which is 1^2.

Ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 + 1 and ends at (2k+1)^2.

For k=1: starts at (2*1-1)^2 +1 = 1^2 +1=2, ends at (2*1+1)^2=3^2=9. Yes, 2 to 9.

For k=2: starts at (4-1)^2 +1=9+1=10, ends at 5^2=25. So 10 to 25.

For k=3: starts at (6-1)^2 +1=25+1=26, ends at 7^2=49.

And so on.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

The size of ring k: since it's a square of side 2k+1, but excluding the inner square of side 2k-1, so number of cells is (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = [4k^2 + 4k +1] - [4k^2 -4k +1] = 8k.

Yes, 8k cells in ring k.

Now, for a given n, find the smallest m such that (2m+1)^2 >= n.

Set r such that (2r-1)^2 < n <= (2r+1)^2.

Since ring k ends at (2k+1)^2, so find k where (2k+1)^2 >= n and (2(k-1)+1)^2 < n, i.e., (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

For n=1, it's ring 0, but we can handle separately.

For n>1, k >=1.

So for n=2026, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2k+1)^2.

Compute sqrt(2026). sqrt(2025)=45, since 45^2=2025.

2025=45^2, so (2k+1)^2 = 2025? But 2025 is a square, so it should be the end of a ring.

45 = 2k+1? Then 2k+1=45, k=22.

Then (2k-1)^2 = (44-1)^2? 2k-1=2*22-1=43, 43^2=1849.

So ring k=22: from 1849 +1 =1850 to 45^2=2025.

But n=2026 > 2025, so not in ring 22.

2025 is end of ring 22, so next ring k=23.

(2*23 -1)^2 = (46-1)^2=45^2=2025? No.

k=23: (2k-1)^2 = (46-1)^2? 2k-1=2*23-1=45, so (45)^2=2025.

Then starts at 2025 +1=2026, ends at (2*23 +1)^2=(46+1)^2=47^2=2209.

So n=2026 is in ring k=23, and it's the first number of the ring, since it starts at 2026.

Ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1 = 2025 +1=2026, yes.

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

Now, where is this located? In the spiral, each ring starts at a specific position and direction.

For ring k, it starts at the cell immediately to the right of the last cell of the previous ring.

The last cell of ring k-1 is at the bottom-right corner of the (2(k-1)+1)=2k-1 size square.

The grid: for a ring k, the square goes from x= -k to x=k, y= -k to y=k, but excluding the inner k-1.

The outer square for ring k is from -k to k in both x and y.

But the inner square (for k-1) is from -(k-1) to k-1.

So ring k occupies the cells where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

Because for example, ring k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so x=±1,y=0 or x=0,y=±1, but not (0,0), so cells: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1), but earlier we have more: (1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1), all with max(|x|,|y|)=1? For (1,1), max(1,1)=1, yes. So all cells with max(|x|,|y|)=k.

For k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both less than 1, so includes corners and edges. Total cells: for each side, but corners shared.

Number of cells: for max(|x|,|y|)=k, it's the perimeter of the square from -k to k.

The square has side length 2k+1? From -k to k is 2k+1 cells in each direction? From -k to k inclusive is 2k+1 values.

But the cells where max(|x|,|y|)=k are those on the boundary of the square [-k,k] x [-k,k].

The total cells in the square: (2k+1)^2.

Inner square: [-k+1,k-1] x [-k+1,k-1]? For max(|x|,|y|) < k, which is |x| <= k-1, |y| <= k-1, so size (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2.

So ring has (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = 8k, as before.

Now, the starting point: for each ring, it starts at the bottom-right corner? For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

For k=1: starts at (1,0) with 2.

Bottom-right: (1,-1) is 9, which is end.

Typically, it starts at the cell immediately to the right of the end of previous ring.

End of ring k-1: for k-1, the last cell is at the bottom-right corner, which is (k-1, -(k-1))? For k=1, previous ring is ring 0, which is just (0,0)=1. End is 1.

Then ring 1 starts at (1,0), which is east of (0,0).

Similarly, for ring 2: previous ring ended at (1,-1)=9? Then ring 2 starts at (2,-1)=10, which is east of (1,-1).

In general, ring k starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1, -0)=(1,0), yes.

For k=2: (2,-1), yes, 10.

For k=3: (3,-2), should be 26? Earlier we have after 25, which is end of ring 2 at? Ring 2 ends at 25, where is it?

Ring 2: from 10 to 25. Starts at (2,-1)=10, then moves up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? Earlier I thought (2,2)=13.

Then west to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17? Earlier I said (-2,2)=17.

Then south to (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20

Then east? To (-1,-1)=21? But (-1,-1) is occupied? In ring 1, (-1,-1)=7, but ring 2 is outside, so (-1,-1) is already occupied? No, ring 1 has max(|x|,|y|)=1, so (-1,-1) is in ring 1, but ring 2 has max(|x|,|y|)=2, so (-1,-1) has max=1, so not in ring 2. So after (-2,-1)=20, move east to (-1,-1)? But (-1,-1) is already occupied by 7, so cannot.

After (-2,-1)=20, facing south? Last move was south to (-2,-1). Then, facing south, left is east to (-1,-1), but occupied, so continue south to (-2,-2)=21? Then at (-2,-2), facing south, left is east to (-1,-2), free? So turn left to face east, move to (-1,-2)=22? Then east to (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25? Then next ring starts at (3,-2)=26? But (2,-2) is end, so east to (3,-2)=26.

But earlier for k=3, start at (3,-2)=26.

Now, end of ring k is at (k, -k)? For k=1: (1,-1)=9, yes. For k=2: (2,-2)=25, yes. For k=3: (3,-3)=? 47^2=2209, but (3,-3) would be a cell.

In general, ring k ends at (k, -k).

And starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1,0), yes. k=2: (2,-1), yes. k=3: (3,-2), yes.

Now, direction: it starts moving east? But from (k, -(k-1)), it moves north? For k=1: at (1,0), moves north to (1,1)? But earlier we moved to (1,1)=3? But in sequence, after (1,0)=2, moved to (0,1)? No, in our initial, we moved to (1,1)=3? But in the grid we assumed (1,1)=3.

But in the movement, from (1,0), it moves north to (1,1)=3.

But in the coordinate, (1,1) is northeast, but anyway.

For ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k) ? Earlier I said (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k).

Then it moves north? For k=1: (1,0) to (1,1), which is north? From (1,0) to (1,1) is north, yes.

Then for k=2: (2,-1) to (2,0)=11? Which is north, yes.

Then for k=3: (3,-2) to (3,-1)? But earlier I thought (3,-2)=26, then north to (3,-1)=27? But let me confirm.

In ring k, after starting at (k, 1-k), it moves north until y=k.

Since it moves north, increasing y, from y=1-k to y=k.

The number of steps: from y=1-k to y=k, that's k - (1-k) = 2k-1 steps? But each step is one cell.

y starts at 1-k, ends at k, so delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1.

Since moving north, same x, so it moves to (k, y) for y from 1-k to k, inclusive? But it starts at y=1-k, and moves to y=k, so the y-values: from 1-k to k, which is 2k steps? Let's see.

For k=1: y from 1-1=0 to 1, so y=0,1. But starts at (1,0), then moves to (1,1). So two cells: (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is the start, and (1,1) is next. But in ring k=1, there are 8 cells, but here only two.

I think I missed. After moving north, it turns west.

In ring k, the path is: start at (k, 1-k), move north to (k, k), then move west to (-k, k), then move south to (-k, -k), then move east to (k, -k).

But (k, -k) is the end.

Now, the number of cells: moving north: from y=1-k to y=k, with x=k fixed. y increases from 1-k to k, so number of cells: k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 +k +1 = 2k? For k=1: y from 0 to 1, so y=0,1: two cells. But should include (1,0) and (1,1).

But in ring k=1, total 8 cells, so other parts.

Then from (k,k), move west to (-k,k), so x from k to -k, y=k fixed. x decreases from k to -k, so number of cells: k - (-k) + 1 = 2k+1? But includes start and end.

x from k to -k inclusive, so values k,k-1,...,-k, which is 2k+1 values.

Similarly for others.

But total would be: north: from (k,1-k) to (k,k): y from 1-k to k, so number of cells: k - (1-k) + 1 = 2k.

But (k,1-k) is start, (k,k) is end.

Then west: from (k,k) to (-k,k): x from k to -k, so 2k+1 cells? But (k,k) is shared, so if we include it, we double count.

Typically, the path is continuous, so each segment starts where the previous ended.

So: segment 1: move north from (k,1-k) to (k,k). The y-coordinates: from y=1-k to y=k. The number of steps: from start to end, delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1, so number of moves is 2k-1, number of cells covered: since it includes start and end, number of cells is (2k-1) + 1? When moving from A to B, the cells visited include A and B, and if moving step by step, number of cells is number of moves plus one.

If you move m steps, you visit m+1 cells.

From y=1-k to y=k, the difference in y is k - (1-k) = 2k-1, so if moving north, each step increases y by 1, so number of steps is 2k-1, so number of cells visited is (2k-1) + 1 = 2k.

For k=1: y from 0 to 1, steps: from y=0 to y=1, one step, cells: start (1,0), end (1,1), two cells. Yes.

Then at (k,k), move west to (-k,k). From x=k to x=-k, delta x = -k - k = -2k, so |delta x|=2k, so number of steps: 2k, number of cells: 2k + 1? From (k,k) to (-k,k), x decreases from k to -k, difference in x is -2k, so magnitude 2k, so 2k steps? But cells: x=k, k-1, ..., -k. So values from k to -k inclusive, number is k - (-k) + 1 = 2k+1.

But since we start at (k,k), which is already included in the previous segment? In the path, when we move from (k,1-k) to (k,k), we end at (k,k). Then we start moving west from (k,k) to (-k,k). So the cell (k,k) is visited twice? No, in the path, we are at (k,k) at the end of first segment, and we start the next segment from there, so it's only visited once. So in the segment, we move from (k,k) to (-k,k), visiting cells with x=k,k-1,...,-k, y=k, so 2k+1 cells? But for k=1: from (1,1) to (-1,1), cells: (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1). Three cells. But earlier north segment had two cells: (1,0),(1,1). So total so far: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1). But (1,1) is shared? In path: start at (1,0), move to (1,1), then to (0,1), then to (-1,1). So cells: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1). Four cells, but ring has eight, so missing.

After (-1,1), move south to (-1,0), etc.

So segment: after west, at (-k,k), then move south to (-k,-k).

From y=k to y=-k, delta y = -k - k = -2k, magnitude 2k, so 2k steps? Cells: y from k down to -k, so y=k,k-1,...,-k, number: k - (-k) +1 = 2k+1 cells.

Then from (-k,-k), move east to (k,-k)? From x=-k to x=k, delta x=2k, so 2k steps, cells: x=-k,-k+1,...,k, number: k - (-k) +1=2k+1 cells.

But total cells: north: 2k cells? Earlier for north: from y=1-k to k, 2k cells? For k=1: 2 cells: (1,0),(1,1)

West: from (k,k) to (-k,k): for k=1: (1,1) to (-1,1): cells (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1) — but (1,1) is already included in north? In the path, when we list the segments, the starting point of each segment is the end of previous, so we should not count it twice.

So for the entire ring, the path visits each cell exactly once, so total cells should sum to 8k.

Now, segment 1: north: starts at (k,1-k), ends at (k,k). Cells: (k,y) for y=1-k to k. Number: from y=1-k to k inclusive, number is k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 +k +1 = 2k.

Segment 2: west: starts at (k,k), ends at (-k,k). Cells: (x,k) for x=k down to -k. But since starts at (k,k), which is already covered, but if we list (x,k) for x=k,k-1,...,-k, that's 2k+1 cells, but includes (k,k) which is end of previous segment. So if we add, we double count (k,k).

To avoid double counting, we can list the cells excluding the start point, but better to compute the range.

The cells in north segment: all (k,y) for y=1-k to k. This includes (k,k).

West segment: all (x,k) for x=k-1 down to -k. Since we start from (k,k), but we already have it, so we move to x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k. So x from k-1 to -k, which is |k-1 - (-k)| +1 = |2k-1| +1? Values from k-1 down to -k, so min x=-k, max x=k-1, number: (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

Similarly, south segment: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k). Starts at (-k,k), moves south to (-k,-k). Cells: (-k,y) for y=k-1 down to -k? Since starts at (-k,k), which is end of west segment, so move to y=k-1, k-2, ..., -k. So y from k-1 to -k, number: (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1+k+1=2k.

Then east segment: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k). Starts at (-k,-k), moves east to (k,-k). Cells: (x,-k) for x=-k+1 to k? Since starts at (-k,-k), move to x=-k+1, -k+2, ..., k. So x from -k+1 to k, number: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

Now total cells: north: 2k, west: 2k, south: 2k, east: 2k, total 8k, good.

For each segment, 2k cells.

The segments are:

1. North: from (k,1-k) to (k,k): cells (k,y) for y=1-k to k.

2. West: from (k,k) to (-k,k): but as above, cells (x,k) for x=k-1 down to -k. So x from k-1 to -k, decreasing.

3. South: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k): cells (-k,y) for y=k-1 down to -k. So y from k-1 to -k, decreasing.

4. East: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k): cells (x,-k) for x=-k+1 to k. So x from -k+1 to k, increasing.

The numbers are assigned in order along this path.

The ring starts with the first cell: (k,1-k) with number s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

Then it goes through the segments in order.

For n=2026, we found it is in ring k=23, and it is the first number of the ring, so it is at the start position: (k,1-k) = (23,1-23) = (23,-22)

Now, we need to find the eight neighbors of this cell: (23,-22)

The neighbors are all cells adjacent orthogonally or diagonally, so all (x,y) with |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, except itself.

So positions:

(23+1,-22) = (24,-22) east

(23-1,-22) = (22,-22) west

(23,-22+1) = (23,-21) north? Assuming y increases up.

(23,-22-1) = (23,-23) south

(23+1,-22+1) = (24,-21) northeast

(23-1,-22+1) = (22,-21) northwest

(23+1,-22-1) = (24,-23) southeast

(23-1,-22-1) = (22,-23) southwest

So the eight neighbors: (24,-22), (22,-22), (23,-21), (23,-23), (24,-21), (22,-21), (24,-23), (22,-23)

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions, but since the spiral is filled, each position has a number, but we need to find which number is at each of these cells.

Since we know the position, we can find which ring each neighbor is in, and then find its number based on the path in that ring.

First, note that these neighbors are all at distance max(|x|,|y|) = ? For (24,-22): max(24,22)=24? |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24.

Similarly, (22,-22): max(22,22)=22

(23,-21): max(23,21)=23

(23,-23): max(23,23)=23

(24,-21): max(24,21)=24

(22,-21): max(22,21)=22

(24,-23): max(24,23)=24

(22,-23): max(22,23)=23

So the max values are: 22,23,24.

Specifically:

- max=22: (22,-22), (22,-21)? (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22

(22,-22): max=22

(22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23? Earlier I said 23.

List:

Cell: max(|x|,|y|)

(24,-22): max(24,22)=24

(22,-22): max(22,22)=22

(23,-21): max(23,21)=23

(23,-23): max(23,23)=23

(24,-21): max(24,21)=24

(22,-21): max(22,21)=22

(24,-23): max(24,23)=24

(22,-23): max(22,23)=23

So neighbors with max=22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

With max=23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

(23,-21): max=23, (23,-23): max=23, (22,-23): max=23? |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, yes.

And with max=24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

And (22,-22) and (22,-21) are max=22.

Is there any with max less than 22? No, since min max is 22.

Now, each cell with max(|x|,|y|)=m is in ring m.

Since ring m consists of all cells with max(|x|,|y|)=m.

So:

- Cells in ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

- Cells in ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

- Cells in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

Now, we need to find the number at each of these positions.

Since we know the ring and the position, we can find where it falls in the path of its ring.

Recall for a ring m, it starts at (m,1-m) with number s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Then moves north to (m,m), covering cells (m,y) for y=1-m to m.

Number of cells: 2m, as before.

Then moves west to (-m,m), but covering cells (x,m) for x=m-1 down to -m, so 2m cells.

Then south to (-m,-m), cells (-m,y) for y=m-1 down to -m, 2m cells.

Then east to (m,-m), cells (x,-m) for x=-m+1 to m, 2m cells.

Total 8m cells.

Now, for each neighbor, we need to find its position and compute the number.

First, let's list the neighbors and their rings:

1. (22,-22) : ring 22

2. (22,-21) : ring 22

3. (23,-21) : ring 23

4. (23,-23) : ring 23

5. (22,-23) : ring 23

6. (24,-22) : ring 24

7. (24,-21) : ring 24

8. (24,-23) : ring 24

Now, since ring 24 is outside, and n=2026 is in ring 23, which is just starting, ring 24 is not yet filled, but since we are finding neighbors at the time when 2026 is placed, but the neighbors might be filled later? No, in the spiral, when we place a number, all neighbors should already be placed? Or not?

Important point: in the spiral filling, when we place a number, the neighbors might not all be filled yet, because the spiral grows outward.

For example, when we place the first number 1, neighbors are not filled yet, but in this case, for 1, when it's placed, no neighbors are there, but later when neighbors are placed, but the problem is asking for the neighbors of the number 2026, meaning the cells adjacent to it, regardless of when they are filled, but since the spiral is filled sequentially, and we are to find the numbers in those adjacent cells, which must have been filled before or after? Actually, since the spiral moves outward, when we place a number on a ring, the inner rings are already filled, but the outer rings are not yet filled.

Specifically, for a cell in ring k, its neighbors could be in ring k-1, k, or k+1.

But ring k+1 is not yet filled when we place ring k, so those neighbors in ring k+1 are still empty, meaning no number assigned yet. But the problem asks for the sum of neighbors, implying that all neighbors have numbers, so probably for cells not on the boundary, all neighbors are filled, but for cells on the edge of the spiral, some neighbors might be outside and not filled.

In this case, 2026 is the first cell of ring 23, so it's on the "east" side, but specifically at (23,-22).

Now, looking at its neighbors:

- West: (22,-22): this is in ring 22, which is already filled since ring 22 is inner.

- North: (23,-21): ring 23, same ring, but since we are just placing the first cell, this is not filled yet.

- South: (23,-23): ring 23, not filled yet.

- East: (24,-22): ring 24, not filled yet.

Similarly diagonals: northwest (22,-21): ring 22, filled; northeast (24,-21): ring 24, not filled; southwest (22,-23): ring 23? Earlier we have (22,-23) max=23, ring 23, not filled; southeast (24,-23): ring 24, not filled.

So only the neighbors in ring 22 are filled: specifically (22,-22) and (22,-21)? And possibly others?

From above:

Filled neighbors: those in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

But are there others? What about (21,-22) or something? No, the neighbors are only the eight listed.

Specifically:

(22,-22): ring 22, filled

(22,-21): ring 22, filled

(23,-21): ring 23, not filled yet

(23,-23): ring 23, not filled

(24,-22): ring 24, not filled

(24,-21): ring 24, not filled

(24,-23): ring 24, not filled

(22,-23): ring 23, not filled? Earlier I said (22,-23) max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,23)=23, so ring 23, not filled yet.

But is there any neighbor in ring 21 or inner? For example, southwest is (22,-23), which is ring 23, but what about directly south? (23,-23), ring 23.

But (22,-22) is west, ring 22.

Is there a neighbor at (21,-22) or something? No, because neighbors are only adjacent cells, so |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, so for (23,-22), neighbors are as listed, all with |dx|<=1, |dy|<=1, dx,dy integers.

So only those eight.

Now, at the moment when we place 2026 at (23,-22), which neighbors are already occupied? Since the spiral fills sequentially outward, and ring 23 is just starting, all cells in ring 23 except possibly some are not filled, but specifically, since it's the first cell, no other cell in ring 23 is filled yet.

Cells in ring 22 are all filled, since ring 22 ended at (22,-22) with number (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

So ring 22 is completely filled.

Now, neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

(22,-21) is also in ring 22, since max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,21)=22.

Similarly, (22,-22) max=22.

Now, are there other neighbors in ring 22? For example, (21,-22), but (21,-22) is not a neighbor; neighbors are only the eight, and (21,-22) would be dx=-2, dy=0, not adjacent.

Similarly, (22,-23) is ring 23, not filled.

So only two neighbors are filled: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

But earlier for center 1, it had eight neighbors filled, but that was after the ring was filled. Here, when we place 2026, only the inner neighbors might be filled, but not the outer or same ring.

But the problem asks for "the sum of all 8 neighbors", implying that all neighbors exist and have numbers, but in this case, six of them are not yet assigned a number, since they are in higher rings.

But that can't be, because for example, when we place 1, if we consider neighbors, they are not filled, but the problem probably assumes that we consider the grid as fully filled up to that point, or perhaps when the number is placed, but for 1, it has neighbors 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 which are filled later.

But the problem is: "the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026", and since 2026 is placed, and neighbors are defined as adjacent cells, but those cells may not have numbers yet. However, in the context, probably we need to find what numbers are eventually placed in those neighbor cells, but that might be ambiguous.

Perhaps for any number not on the boundary, all neighbors are filled, but 2026 is on the boundary of the spiral, since it's the first of its ring.

But in the spiral, the "boundary" is the outer edge, but as we fill, the unfilled part is outside.

But for the number 2026, when it is placed, only cells with smaller numbers are filled, so neighbors with smaller numbers are filled, others are not.

In this case, only neighbors in ring 22 or lower are filled, which are (22,-22) and (22,-21), and possibly others? Is there a neighbor in ring 21? For example, (23,-22) itself is ring 23, neighbors: (22,-22) ring 22, (22,-21) ring 22, (23,-21) ring 23, etc. No neighbor with max<22, because for example (22,-22) is min max is 22 for these.

(21,-22) would be max(21,22)=22, but (21,-22) is not a neighbor; it's not adjacent to (23,-22). Distance is |dx|=2, |dy|=0, not adjacent.

Similarly, (22,-20) would be max(22,20)=22, but not adjacent.

So only two neighbors are filled: (22,-22) and (22,-21), both in ring 22.

But the problem asks for all eight neighbors, so probably we need to consider the final grid, where all numbers are filled, and find the numbers at those positions, regardless of when they are placed.

In other words, for the cell containing 2026, what are the numbers in the eight adjacent cells in the completed grid.

Since the grid is filled completely, all cells have numbers, so we can compute the number at each neighbor position.

For 2026, which is at (23,-22), its neighbors are as listed, and we need to find what number is at each of those positions in the infinite grid.

So we need to compute the number for each neighbor cell.

As listed, they are in rings 22,23,24.

Specifically:

- (22,-22) : ring 22

- (22,-21) : ring 22

- (23,-21) : ring 23

- (23,-23) : ring 23

- (22,-23) : ring 23

- (24,-22) : ring 24

- (24,-21) : ring 24

- (24,-23) : ring 24

Now, for each, we need to find its number based on its position and ring.

First, for cells in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Ring 22 starts at (22,1-22)=(22,-21) with number s_22 = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

(2m-1)^2 +1 for m=22: 43^2=1849, +1=1850.

Now, the path in ring 22:

Starts at (22,-21) with 1850.

Then moves north to (22,22): cells (22,y) for y= -21 to 22? From y=1-m=1-22=-21 to y=m=22.

Number of cells: 2*22=44 cells? But total ring is 8*22=176 cells, so this is only the north segment.

The north segment: cells (22,y) for y= -21 to 22 inclusive.

y from -21 to 22, number of values: 22 - (-21) +1 = 22+21+1=44, yes.

And it starts at y=-21, ends at y=22.

The number increases as we move.

Since it starts at (22,-21) with 1850, and moves north, increasing y, so each step north increases y by 1, and number increases by 1.

So for a cell (22,y), the number is 1850 + (y - (-21)) = 1850 + y + 21 = 1871 + y

y is the coordinate, so number = 1850 + (y - (-21)) = 1850 + y + 21 = 1871 + y

Check for y=-21: 1871 -21=1850, correct.

For y=22: 1871+22=1893.

But this is only for the north segment. The cell (22,-22) is not in the north segment; it's in a different segment.

(22,-22): x=22, y=-22.

In ring 22, the north segment is only when x=22, y from -21 to 22.

But (22,-22) has y=-22, which is less than -21, so not in north segment.

Where is it? Probably in the east segment or south.

Recall the segments:

After north segment, it moves west to (-22,22), covering x from 21 down to -22 at y=22? Earlier: west segment: cells (x,22) for x=22-1=21 down to -22.

So x from 21 to -22, y=22.

Then south segment: cells (-22,y) for y=21 down to -22? y from m-1=21 down to -m=-22.

Then east segment: cells (x,-22) for x=-22+1=-21 to 22.

Ah, so (22,-22) is in the east segment, since y=-22, and x from -21 to 22.

Specifically, (22,-22) is the end of the east segment.

Now, the east segment starts at (-22,-22)? After south segment, ends at (-22,-22), then moves east to (22,-22).

Cells: (x,-22) for x=-21 to 22.

Starts at x=-21, ends at x=22.

Number: the east segment is the last segment of the ring.

The entire ring has 8*22=176 cells.

It starts at north segment: 44 cells, from 1850 to ? First cell (22,-21):1850, last cell (22,22):1850 + 43? Since 44 cells, from index 0 to 43, number from 1850 to 1850+43=1893.

Then west segment: starts at (21,22)? After (22,22), moves west to (21,22), then to (20,22), ..., to (-22,22).

Number of cells: 2*22=44 cells? Earlier we said 2k for each segment, k=22, so 44 cells.

Starts at (21,22), which is the next cell after (22,22).

So number: after (22,22)=1893, next is (21,22)=1894.

Then ends at (-22,22)=1894 + 43? 44 cells: from 1894 to 1894+43=1937.

Then south segment: starts at (-22,21)? Moves south to (-22,20), ..., to (-22,-22).

Cells: (-22,y) for y=21 down to -22.

Number: starts at (-22,21)=1938? After (-22,22)=1937? Last was (-22,22)=1937, then move south to (-22,21)=1938.

Ends at (-22,-22)=1938 + ? y from 21 to -22, decreasing.

Number of cells: y=21,20,...,-22, so values from 21 to -22 inclusive, number: 21 - (-22) +1=21+22+1=44 cells.

So numbers from 1938 to 1938+43=1981.

Then east segment: starts at (-21,-22)? Moves east to (-20,-22), ..., to (22,-22).

Cells: (x,-22) for x=-21 to 22.

Number: starts at (-21,-22)=1982? After (-22,-22)=1981, then move east to (-21,-22)=1982.

Ends at (22,-22)=1982 + ? x from -21 to 22, increasing.

Number of steps: from x=-21 to x=22, delta x=43, so 43 steps? Cells: x=-21,-20,...,22, number: 22 - (-21) +1=22+21+1=44 cells.

So numbers from 1982 to 1982+43=2025.

And 2025 is the end of ring 22, since (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

Yes, so (22,-22)=2025.

Now, we also need (22,-21).

(22,-21) is in the north segment, since north segment is (22,y) for y=-21 to 22.

Specifically, y=-21, which is the start.

So at (22,-21), number is 1850, as we had.

Now, next, neighbors in ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

Ring 23 starts at (23,1-23)=(23,-22) with number s_23 = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026, which is our number, but this is the cell itself, not neighbor.

Now, neighbors: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

First, (23,-21): this is in ring 23.

The north segment of ring 23: cells (23,y) for y=1-23=-22 to y=23.

So y from -22 to 23.

(23,-21) is in this segment, since y=-21 is between -22 and 23.

The segment starts at (23,-22) with 2026.

Moves north, so increases y.

So from y=-22 to y=23.

At (23,y), number = 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22 = 2048 + y

Since each step north increases y by 1, number by 1.

So for (23,-21), y=-21, number = 2048 + (-21) = 2048 - 21 = 2027

Is that right? Start at y=-22: 2026

Then y=-21: next cell, so 2027, yes.

Similarly, (23,-23): y=-23.

But y=-23 is not in the north segment, since north segment y from -22 to 23.

y=-23 < -22, so not in north.

Where is it? Probably in the east segment or south.

The east segment: after south segment, moves east to (23,-23)? East segment: cells (x,-23) for x=-23+1=-22 to 23? Earlier: east segment: (x,-m) for x=-m+1 to m, m=23, so x=-22 to 23.

y=-23.

So (23,-23) is in the east segment, specifically the end point.

Now, the east segment is the last segment, so we need to find its number.

First, ring 23 has 8*23=184 cells.

Starts at north segment: 2*23=46 cells, from (23,-22) to (23,23).

Number: starts at (23,-22)=2026

Ends at (23,23)=2026 + 45? 46 cells, so from 2026 to 2026+45=2071.

Then west segment: cells (x,23) for x=22 down to -23? x from m-1=22 down to -m=-23.

So x=22,21,...,-23.

Starts at (22,23), next after (23,23)=2071, so (22,23)=2072.

Ends at (-23,23)=2072 + ? number of cells: x from 22 to -23, decreasing, number: 22 - (-23) +1=22+23+1=46 cells.

So numbers 2072 to 2072+45=2117.

Then south segment: cells (-23,y) for y=22 down to -23? y from m-1=22 down to -m=-23.

Starts at (-23,22)? After (-23,23)=2117? Last was (-23,23)=2117, move south to (-23,22)=2118.

Ends at (-23,-23)=2118 + ? y from 22 to -23, decreasing, number: 22 - (-23) +1=22+23+1=46 cells.

Numbers 2118 to 2118+45=2163.

Then east segment: cells (x,-23) for x=-22 to 23? x from -m+1=-22 to m=23.

Starts at (-22,-23)? After (-23,-23)=2163, move east to (-22,-23)=2164.

Ends at (23,-23)=2164 + ? x from -22 to 23, increasing, delta x=45, so 46 cells? x=-22,-21,...,23, number: 23 - (-22) +1=23+22+1=46 cells.

Numbers from 2164 to 2164+45=2209.

And end of ring is (23,-23)=2209? But should be (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes.

So (23,-23)=2209.

Now, we need (22,-23).

(22,-23): x=22, y=-23.

In ring 23, where is it?

Possible segments: north: x=23, not here.

West: y=23, not here.

South: x=-23, not here.

East: y=-23, x from -22 to 23.

So yes, in east segment: (x,-23) for x=-22 to 23.

So (22,-23) is in this segment.

The segment starts at (-22,-23)=2164, ends at (23,-23)=2209.

As x increases, number increases.

x from -22 to 23.

At (x,-23), number = 2164 + (x - (-22)) = 2164 + x + 22 = 2186 + x

Since starts at x=-22: 2164, then x=-21:2165, etc.

So for (22,-23), x=22, number=2186 + 22=2208.

Since it ends at x=23:2186+23=2209, correct.

Now, finally, neighbors in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

Ring 24 starts at (24,1-24)=(24,-23) with number s_24 = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Now, each of these is in ring 24.

First, (24,-23): this is the start position, so number is s_24=2210.

Now, (24,-22) and (24,-21) are in the north segment.

North segment: cells (24,y) for y=1-24=-23 to y=24.

Starts at (24,-23)=2210.

Moves north, so increases y.

So for (24,y), number = 2210 + (y - (-23)) = 2210 + y + 23 = 2233 + y

Now, (24,-22): y=-22, number=2233 -22=2211

(24,-21): y=-21, number=2233 -21=2212

Now, we have all neighbors:

List them:

1. (22,-22): ring 22, east segment, end point, number=2025

2. (22,-21): ring 22, north segment, start point, number=1850

3. (23,-21): ring 23, north segment, number=2027 (since y=-21, 2048 + y? Earlier for ring 23 north: number=2048 + y? Earlier I had for (23,y): 2048 + y

But y=-21, 2048 -21=2027, yes.

4. (23,-23): ring 23, east segment, end point, number=2209

5. (22,-23): ring 23, east segment, number=2208

6. (24,-22): ring 24, north segment, number=2211 (since y=-22, 2233 + y? 2233 -22=2211)

7. (24,-21): ring 24, north segment, number=2212

8. (24,-23): ring 24, north segment, start point, number=2210

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers:

- (22,-22): 2025

- (22,-21): 1850

- (23,-21): 2027

- (23,-23): 2209

- (22,-23): 2208

- (24,-22): 2211

- (24,-21): 2212

- (24,-23): 2210

Now, sum = 2025 + 1850 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208 + 2211 + 2212 + 2210

Add them step by step.

First, group them.

Note that some are consecutive.

List:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Add in pairs.

1850 + 2025 = 3875

2027 + 2208 = 4235

2209 + 2210 = 4419

2211 + 2212 = 4423

Now sum these: 3875 + 4235 = 8110

4419 + 4423 = 8842

Then 8110 + 8842 = 16952

Add directly:

1850

+2025 = 3875

+2027 = 3875 + 2027 = 5902

+2208 = 5902 + 2208 = 8110

+2209 = 8110 + 2209 = 10319

+2210 = 10319 + 2210 = 12529

+2211 = 12529 + 2211 = 14740

+2212 = 14740 + 2212 = 16952

So sum is 16952.

But let me verify with a smaller example to make sure.

For example, take the center 1 at (0,0). Neighbors: as we listed: (1,0):2, (0,1):4, (-1,0):6, (0,-1):8, (1,1):3, (-1,1):5, (-1,-1):7, (1,-1):9. Sum 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

Now, according to our method: for n=1, but it's ring 0, neighbors are in ring 1.

(1,0): ring 1, north segment? Ring 1: starts at (1,0) with 2.

North segment: (1,y) for y=0 to 1? y=1-1=0 to y=1.

So (1,0): start, number=2

(1,1): next, number=3? But we have it as 3.

But neighbors include (0,1):4, which is west segment? Ring 1: north: (1,y) y=0,1: numbers 2,3

West: (x,1) for x=0 down to -1? x from m-1=0 to -1? k=1, x from 1-1=0 down to -1.

So (0,1): number? After (1,1)=3, next is (0,1)=4

Then (-1,1)=5

South: (-1,y) y=0 down to -1? y from m-1=0 to -1.

After (-1,1)=5, move south to (-1,0)=6

Then (-1,-1)=7

East: (x,-1) for x=0 to 1? x from -m+1=0 to 1? m=1, x from -1+1=0 to 1.

After (-1,-1)=7, move east to (0,-1)=8

Then (1,-1)=9

So neighbors: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9, same as before.

Now for our case, we have sum 16952.

But is there a pattern or easier way? Notice that for a cell on the "east" side, but in this case, since it's the start, and neighbors are symmetric in a way, but not really.

We can compute the sum directly.

Since we have all numbers, and we computed, probably correct.

But let me check the sum again.

List:

1850

2025

2027

2208

2209

2210

2211

2212

Add in order:

1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

5902 + 2208 = 8110

8110 + 2209 = 10319

10319 + 2210 = 12529

12529 + 2211 = 14740

14740 + 2212 = 16952, same as before.

Note that 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Group: 1850 is small, others are around 2000-2200.

Note that 2025, 2027 are consecutive? 2025 and 2027 are not consecutive.

2025 and 2027 differ by 2.

Similarly, 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are consecutive from 2208 to 2212.

2208 to 2212 inclusive: 5 numbers: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Sum = (number of terms) * (first + last)/2 = 5 * (2208 + 2212)/2 = 5 * 4420 / 2 = 5 * 2210 = 11050

Then the others: 1850, 2025, 2027

1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

Then total sum: 5902 + 11050 = 16952, same.

Now, is this correct? But in the neighbors, we have numbers from different rings, but seems consistent.

Another way to think: since 2026 is at (23,-22), and neighbors are as listed.

Notice that the neighbors include cells that are part of the same ring or adjacent rings.

But anyway, we have the sum.

So the answer should be 16952.

But let me confirm one of them.

For example, (22,-22): we said 2025, which is the end of ring 22, correct.

(22,-21): start of ring 22 north segment, 1850, correct.

(23,-21): in ring 23 north segment, y=-21, number=2048 + y =2048 -21=2027, and since start is (23,-22)=2026, so (23,-21) should be next, 2027, yes.

(23,-23): end of ring 23, 2209, correct.

(22,-23): in ring 23 east segment, we computed 2208, and since it's before (23,-23)=2209, so yes.

(24,-23): start of ring 24, 2210.

(24,-22): in ring 24 north, y=-22, number=2233 + y? Earlier 2233 + y, but y=-22, 2233-22=2211.

Since start (24,-23)=2210, then next north should be (24,-22)=2211, yes.

(24,-21): next, 2212.

All seem correct.

Sum is 16952.

So the sum of all eight neighbors is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (1) is at (0, 0), the positive x-direction is east, and the positive y-direction is north.

The eight neighboring positions of (23, -22) are:
- (24, -22)
- (22, -22)
- (23, -21)
- (23, -23)
- (24, -21)
- (22, -21)
- (24, -23)
- (22, -23)

Each neighbor belongs to a specific ring based on the maximum of the absolute values of its coordinates (max(|x|, |y|)):
- (22, -22) and (22, -21) are in ring 22.
- (23, -21), (23, -23), and (22, -23) are in ring 23.
- (24, -22), (24, -21), and (24, -23) are in ring 24.

The starting number of ring \(m\) is \((2m-1)^2 + 1\). The path within each ring consists of four segments (north, west, south, east), each containing \(2m\) cells. The number at each neighbor position is calculated as follows:

- For ring 22 (starting number 1850):
  - (22, -22): End of the east segment, number is 2025.
  - (22, -21): Start of the north segment, number is 1850.

- For ring 23 (starting number 2026):
  - (23, -21): In the north segment, number is \(2048 + y = 2048 - 21 = 2027\).
  - (23, -23): End of the east segment, number is 2209.
  - (22, -23): In the east segment, number is \(2186 + x = 2186 + 22 = 2208\).

- For ring 24 (starting number 2210):
  - (24, -23): Start of the north segment, number is 2210.
  - (24, -22): In the north segment, number is \(2233 + y = 2233 - 22 = 2211\).
  - (24, -21): In the north segment, number is \(2233 + y = 2233 - 21 = 2212\).

The numbers at the neighbor positions are:
- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -21): 1850
- (23, -21): 2027
- (23, -23): 2209
- (22, -23): 2208
- (24, -22): 2211
- (24, -21): 2212
- (24, -23): 2210

The sum is calculated as:
\[
2025 + 1850 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208 + 2211 + 2212 + 2210 = 16952
\]

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
