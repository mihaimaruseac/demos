The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand how the spiral is laid out. It starts with 1 at the center, then 2 to the right, 3 up, 4 left, 5 left again? Looking at the grid:

From the center 1, moving right to 2, then up to 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Let me sketch this.

Labeling the positions. Assume the center is at coordinates (0,0), with x increasing right, y increasing up.

So, at (0,0): 1

Then moving right to (1,0): 2

Then moving up to (1,1): 3? But in the given grid, above 1 is 3, and left of 3 is 4? The grid shows:

Row above: 5,4,3 — so probably y=1: x= -1? Let's see.

The grid is given as:

... 5 4 3 ...   this might be y=1, x decreasing

... 6 1 2 ...   this might be y=0, x from -1 to 1? 6 at (-1,0)? But 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), so 6 should be left of 1.

Given:

First row: ... 5 4 3 ... so likely y=1, and x from left to right: but 5,4,3 suggests x decreasing if we assume left to right.

To avoid confusion, let's list the numbers and their positions.

Start at (0,0): 1

Move right to (1,0): 2

Move up to (1,1): 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 3, and left of 3 is 4, so (0,1):4? Then ( -1,1):5?

Then next, move left to (0,1)? But (0,1) is already 4? No.

After (1,1):3, it should go to (0,1):4, then ( -1,1):5, then since it's a spiral, it should go down to ( -1,0):6, then down to ( -1,-1):7, then right to (0,-1):8, then (1,-1):9, and so on.

Confirm with the grid:

Given:

... 5 4 3 ... so at y=1: x= -1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But in my assignment, ( -1,1):5, (0,1):4, (1,1):3 — yes.

Then next row: ... 6 1 2 ... so at y=0: x= -1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2 — yes.

Then next row: ... 7 8 9 ... so at y= -1: x= -1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9 — perfect.

So the spiral goes: start at (0,0)=1, right to (1,0)=2, up to (1,1)=3, left to (0,1)=4, left to (-1,1)=5, down to (-1,0)=6, down to (-1,-1)=7, right to (0,-1)=8, right to (1,-1)=9, then up to (2,-1)? After 9, it should go up to (2,-1)? But (1,-1)=9, then up to (2,-1)? Typically spirals continue.

After (1,-1)=9, since it was moving right, now it should go up. But (2,-1) is right of (1,-1), but in spiral, after completing a layer, it goes up again.

Let me list the sequence:

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0) — east

3 at (1,1) — north

4 at (0,1) — west

5 at (-1,1) — west

6 at (-1,0) — south

7 at (-1,-1) — south

8 at (0,-1) — east

9 at (1,-1) — east

Now, next should be north to (1,0), but (1,0) is already occupied by 2, so instead it turns left, which would be up? After moving east to (1,-1), if it turns left (counterclockwise), it should go north to (1,0), but occupied, so probably it goes to (2,-1)? Standard Ulam spiral turns when it hits an occupied cell or boundary.

After 9 at (1,-1), it should go up, but (1,0) is above it, occupied, so it might go to (2,-1)? But (2,-1) is east? I think I have direction wrong.

When moving east, turning left would be north, but if north is occupied, it continues? Standard spiral: after placing 9 at (1,-1), the next cell should be (2,-1)? But in the grid given, it shows after 9, but the next row isn't shown, but logically, it should go to (2,-1)=10, then up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then left to (1,1) but occupied, so (0,1) occupied, etc.

In the given grid, it only shows up to 9, but for 2026, I need a general formula.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are placed in rings. The center 1 is ring 0. Then ring 1 has numbers 2 to 9? 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 8 numbers.

Ring k has 8k numbers? Ring 0: just 1, size 1.

Ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, size 8.

Ring 2: should be 10 to 25? 10 to 25 is 16 numbers, which is 8*2.

Ring 3: 26 to ? 8*3=24 numbers, so 26 to 49? 49-26+1=24, yes.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

Ring 0: k=0, 1^2=1.

Ring 1: k=1, 3^2=9.

Ring 2: k=2, 5^2=25.

Ring 3: k=3, 7^2=49.

Yes.

The first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=1, (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1+1=2.

k=2, (3)^2 +1=10.

k=3, (5)^2 +1=26. Yes.

Now, the number 2026 is in some ring k.

Find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Set m = 2k-1, then m^2 < 2026 ≤ (m+2)^2.

Since ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1 and ends at (2k+1)^2.

So solve (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Compute squares.

Find smallest m odd such that m^2 ≤ 2025? Since 2026 > (2k-1)^2.

Set l = 2k+1, then l^2 ≥ 2026, and (l-2)^2 < 2026.

l is odd.

Find square root of 2026. sqrt(2026) ≈ ? 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

45^2=2025, which is less than 2026, so 2026 > 45^2.

45 is odd, so if l=45, then l^2=2025 < 2026? But we need l^2 ≥ 2026, 45^2=2025 < 2026, so l=47? 47^2=2209.

But (l-2)^2 =45^2=2025 < 2026, and l=47, l^2=2209 ≥2026.

Now, l=2k+1, so 47=2k+1 ⇒ 2k=46 ⇒ k=23.

Ring k=23 starts at (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Exactly 2026.

Now, the first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

For k=23, (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

And it ends at (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209.

Now, since it's the first number of the ring, what position is it in the ring?

The ring has 8k numbers, for k=23, 8*23=184 numbers, from 2026 to 2209 inclusive.

2026 to 2209: 2209-2026+1=184, yes.

Now, the first number is at the "start" of the ring. In which direction?

Recall how the spiral goes. After completing ring k-1, which ends at (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2.

For example, ring 1 ends at 3^2=9.

Then ring 2 starts at 10. Where is 10? After 9 at (1,-1), it moves right to (2,-1)=10.

In our earlier coordinate, (1,-1)=9, then east to (2,-1)=10.

Then north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then west to (1,1)=13? But (1,1) is already 3, occupied? Mistake.

After (2,-1)=10, it should go up (north) to (2,0). Is (2,0) occupied? Previously, we have up to (1,-1)=9, so (2,0) is empty, so (2,0)=11.

Then (2,1)=12.

Then next should be west to (1,1), but (1,1) is already 3, so it must turn. In spiral, it turns when it would hit a cell that is already filled or out of bounds, but since it's growing, it should turn when it tries to go to a cell that is not adjacent in direction? Standard behavior: after moving north to (2,1)=12, the next direction should be west, but since (1,1) is occupied? (1,1) is occupied by 3, but in the path, when it moves from (2,1) west, it would go to (1,1), which is occupied, so it should not go there; instead, it continues or turns? In Ulam spiral, it turns left (counterclockwise) only when the next cell is empty? I think I have it wrong.

Standard is: it moves in a direction until it hits a cell that is occupied or boundary, but since it's filling sequentially, it only turns when it would go out of the current ring or something. Better to think that in each ring, it starts by moving right, then up, then left, then down.

For ring k, it starts at the position immediately right of the end of ring k-1.

Ring k-1 ends at (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2, which is at some corner.

For example, ring 1 (k=1) ends at (1,-1)=9? Earlier: ring 1: numbers 2 to 9.

Where is 9? At (1,-1).

The direction: after placing 8 at (0,-1), then moves right to (1,-1)=9.

Now, ring 2 starts at (2,-1)=10, which is east of (1,-1).

Then it moves up (north) to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12.

Then moves west to (1,1), but (1,1) is occupied by 3? No, in ring 1, (1,1) is 3, which is already filled. But (1,1) is at y=1, x=1, which is part of ring 1.

When starting ring 2 at (2,-1), it moves north: to (2,0), then (2,1), then next would be to (2,2)? Or to (1,1)? The next cell west would be (1,1), but since (1,1) is already filled (by 3), and in the spiral path, it should only move to new cells, so it must go to (2,2)? But that doesn't make sense.

I recall that for ring k, it starts at (k, -k+1) or something. Let's list positions for ring k.

General pattern: for ring k (k≥1), it consists of 8k numbers.

It starts at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1: starts at (1,0)? But earlier we have (1,0)=2.

(1,0) is x=1,y=0.

k=1, (k, 1-k) = (1,0), yes.

Then moves up to (1,1), which is (k,k) = (1,1).

Then moves left to (0,1), (-1,1), which is (-k,k) = (-1,1).

Then moves down to (-1,0), (-1,-1), which is (-k,-k) = (-1,-1).

Then moves right to (0,-1), (1,-1), which is (k,-k) = (1,-1).

For k=1: start at (1,0)=2.

Up to (1,1)=3.

Left to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5.

Down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7.

Right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

Now for ring k=2: starts at (2,-1)? Earlier we said (2,-1)=10.

But according to above, after (1,-1)=9, next should be east to (2,-1)=10.

Then moves up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12.

Now, next should move west? But to (1,1)? Occupied. Instead, it moves to (2,2)? Let's see: from (2,1), it should move west, but since (1,1) is occupied, but in the spiral, for ring 2, it should move west to (1,1), but that's already taken, so perhaps it moves to (2,2) first? No.

I think I remember: after moving up to (2,1), it has moved two steps up? From (2,-1) to (2,0) to (2,1), so two steps north. Since ring k has side length 2k+1, but for movement, in ring k, it moves: right for k steps? Let's think.

Standard: for ring k, starting from (k, -(k-1)) or something.

For k=2, start at (2,-1)? (x,y)=(2,-1).

Then move north: to (2,0), (2,1) — that's two steps, to (2,1).

Then move west: to (1,1), but occupied? Instead, it moves to (1,1)? But (1,1) is occupied by 3, which is from previous ring. But in the sequence, 13 should be at (1,1)? But it's already occupied. Contradiction.

I see the mistake. When ring 2 starts, it should start at (2,-1), but then when it moves north, it goes to (2,0), (2,1), and then since it's the top, it should turn west, but (1,1) is not occupied yet in the sense that it's part of this ring? No, (1,1) is already occupied by 3.

The issue is that for ring k, the cells are from x= -k to k, y= -k to k, but excluding the inner (k-1) ring.

For ring k, the perimeter consists of cells where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

That is, the "ring" is all cells with max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, k=0: max(0,0)=0, only (0,0).

k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so |x|≤1, |y|≤1, but not both |x|<1 and |y|<1, i.e., excluding (0,0). So all cells with |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both less, so corners and edges: (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1) — that's 8 cells, yes.

k=2: max(|x|,|y|)=2, so |x|≤2, |y|≤2, but max is 2, so not both |x|≤1 and |y|≤1. Cells like (2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,-1),(2,-2), etc., total 8*2=16 cells.

The starting point for each ring is at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1, start at (1,0)? Which is 2.

For k=2, start at (2,-1)? Which is 10.

Now the direction: for ring k, it starts by moving in the positive x-direction (east) for a certain distance.

Specifically, from start, it moves east? But in k=2, start at (2,-1), then moves north to (2,0), not east.

The movement is: for each side, it moves in a direction for a certain number of steps.

For ring k, each side has length 2k, but since corners are shared, total cells 8k.

The sides: bottom, right, top, left, but since it's a square, but oriented differently.

Typically, for ring k, it starts at the bottom-right corner? For k=1, (1,0) is bottom-right if y=0 is bottom, but (1,0) is right of center, so east.

Then it moves up (north) to (1,1), which is top-right.

Then left (west) to (0,1), then to (-1,1), top-left.

Then down (south) to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1), bottom-left.

Then right (east) to (0,-1), then to (1,-1), bottom-right.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) ? For k=1, (1,0) = (1, -(0))? -(k-1)=0 for k=1.

For k=2, (2, -(1)) = (2,-1), yes.

Then it moves north for how many steps? To go from y= -1 to y=2? max y=k=2.

From (2,-1) to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)? But (2,2) is corner.

In k=2, from (2,-1) move north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, then (2,2)=13? Then next move west to (1,2), etc.

But earlier I thought (1,1) is occupied, but (1,2) is new.

So yes, (2,2)=13? Then west to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16? Then south to (-1,1)=17? But (-1,1) is already occupied by 5? Problem.

(-1,1) is part of ring 1, occupied by 5. But in ring 2, it should be new cells. So when moving south from (-1,2), it should go to (-1,1), but occupied, so must go to (-1,0)? But (-1,0) is occupied by 6.

I see the issue. The cells for ring k are only those with max(|x|,|y|)=k, so for k=2, |x|≤2, |y|≤2, but max=2, so |x|=2 or |y|=2, but not both less than 2.

So cells like (2,y) for y=-2,-1,0,1,2; (x,2) for x=-1,0,1 (since x=2 and x=-2 already covered); similarly for bottom and left.

Specifically, for max(|x|,|y|)=k, it includes:

- right side: x=k, y from -k to k

- top side: y=k, x from -k to k, but corners shared, so usually we exclude corners when listing sides, but for the path, we include all.

The total number is 8k, as said.

The path for ring k: starts at (k, 1-k) for k≥1? For k=1: (1,0)

For k=2: (2,-1)

Then moves north to (k,k): from (2,-1) to (2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — that's 3 steps? From y=-1 to y=2, delta y=3, so 3 cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)? But (2,-1) is start, so moving to (2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — three moves, four cells including start? No, when we move, we go to new cells.

From start (2,-1), move north to (2,0) — new cell, then to (2,1) — new, then to (2,2) — new. So three cells added: (2,0),(2,1),(2,2). But ring k=2 has 16 cells, so not enough.

From (2,-1) to (2,2) is three moves: to (2,0), to (2,1), to (2,2), so three cells: positions (2,0),(2,1),(2,2). But we need more.

The distance from start to corner. From (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k): y from -(k-1) to k, so delta y = k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1, but that's the number of steps? From y=a to y=b, number of steps is |b-a|, number of cells is |b-a|+1.

From y= -(k-1) to y=k, difference in y is k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1, so number of cells in this segment is (2k-1) - (-(k-1)) +1? Positions from y=min to max.

At x=k, y from -(k-1) to k inclusive.

For k=2, y from -1 to 2 inclusive: y=-1,0,1,2 — four cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2).

But (2,-1) is the start, so when we move, we are adding new cells, but in the path, we start at (2,-1), which is already "added" as the first cell of the ring, so when we move north, we add (2,0), then (2,1), then (2,2), so three new cells, but for the segment, from (2,-1) to (2,2), there are four cells, but the first is already occupied, so we add three more.

For the northward move, from (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k), but (k, -(k-1)) is already occupied (as start), so we move north to (k, -(k-1)+1), (k, -(k-1)+2), ..., up to (k,k).

The y-coordinates: from y_start = -(k-1) to y_end = k.

The values: y_start, y_start+1, ..., y_end.

Number of cells: y_end - y_start +1 = k - (-(k-1)) +1 = k + k -1 +1 = 2k.

For k=2, 4 cells: y=-1,0,1,2. But since we start at y=-1, and move to y=0,1,2, so we add three cells, but total cells in this leg are four, including start.

In the path, when we start the ring, we are at the first cell, so for the first move, we move to the next cell in the direction.

For ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k) — for k=1, (1,0); k=2, (2,-1); k=3, (3,-2), etc.

Then it moves in the direction of increasing y (north) for (2k-1) steps? Let's calculate the number of moves.

For k=1: start at (1,0), move north to (1,1) — one move, to one new cell.

Then move west to (0,1), then to (-1,1) — two moves, two new cells.

Then move south to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1) — two moves.

Then move east to (0,-1), then to (1,-1) — two moves.

Total moves: 1+2+2+2=7 moves, but 8 cells? Start cell is first, then 7 moves to 7 more cells, total 8 cells. Yes.

Cells added: after start, first leg: 1 cell ( (1,1) ), second leg: 2 cells ( (0,1), (-1,1) ), third leg: 2 cells ( (-1,0), (-1,-1) ), fourth leg: 2 cells ( (0,-1), (1,-1) ).

For k=2: start at (2,-1).

Move north: to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) — three moves? But for k=1 it was one move for first leg.

General pattern: for ring k, after start, it moves north for (2k-1) cells? For k=1, 2*1-1=1 cell, yes.

For k=2, 2*2-1=3 cells: after start, add (2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — yes, three cells.

Then next direction: west (negative x). From (2,2) move west to (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — but how many? For k=1, it was 2 cells west: from (-1,1) to (0,1)? After north to (1,1), then west to (0,1), then to (-1,1) — two cells.

For k=2, should be 2k? 4 cells? But 2k for k=2 is 4, but we have only to (-2,2), which is corner.

From (2,2) move west to (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — four cells? But start is at (2,2), so moving to (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — four moves, but we need to add cells.

After north leg, we are at (2,2). Then move west: to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2) — that's four cells added? But for k=1, it was two cells added in west leg.

Number should be 2k for each of the next legs? For k=1: north leg added 1 cell, west added 2, south added 2, east added 2? Total added cells: 1+2+2+2=7, plus start, 8.

For k=2: north leg: added 3 cells (since 2k-1=3).

Then west leg: should add 2k cells? 4 cells? From (2,2) west to (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — that's four cells, but (-2,2) is the corner.

Then next, move south: from (-2,2) to (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2) — again four cells? But for k=1, south added two cells.

Then east: from (-2,-2) to (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2) — but (2,-2) is not the start.

Total added: north:3, west:4, south:4, east:4? 3+4+4+4=15, plus start, 16, good.

But in east leg, from (-2,-2) to (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2) — (2,-2) is added, but the start was (2,-1), so (2,-2) is new.

Now, is (2,-2) adjacent? But in the ring, max(|x|,|y|)=2, so (2,-2) is included.

Now, after adding (2,-2), the next cell would be north to (2,-1), but (2,-1) is already occupied (start), so it stops, perfect.

So for ring k:

- Start at (k, 1-k)  [since for k=1, y=0=1-1; k=2,y=-1=1-2]

- Move north (increasing y) for (2k-1) steps, adding (2k-1) cells, ending at (k,k)

- Then move west (decreasing x) for (2k) steps, adding (2k) cells, ending at (-k,k)

- Then move south (decreasing y) for (2k) steps, adding (2k) cells, ending at (-k,-k)

- Then move east (increasing x) for (2k) steps, adding (2k) cells, ending at (k,-k)

Note: at (k,-k), which is different from start (k,1-k). For example, k=2, start (2,-1), end at (2,-2).

Total cells added: north: 2k-1, west: 2k, south: 2k, east: 2k, sum= (2k-1)+2k+2k+2k=8k-1, but this is the number added after start, so total cells: 1 (start) + (8k-1) = 8k, good.

Now, back to our problem. Number 2026 is the first number of ring k=23, since it starts at (2*23-1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

And it is at position (k, 1-k) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22)

So coordinates (x,y) = (23, -22)

Now, we need the eight neighbors of this cell. The eight neighbors are the cells adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

So, for a cell (a,b), neighbors are:

(a-1,b-1), (a-1,b), (a-1,b+1),

(a,b-1), (a,b+1),

(a+1,b-1), (a+1,b), (a+1,b+1)

So, for (23,-22), the neighbors are:

(22,-23), (22,-22), (22,-21),

(23,-23), (23,-21),

(24,-23), (24,-22), (24,-21)

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions, and sum them.

But these positions may be in different rings, and we need to map positions to numbers.

Since the spiral is symmetric, but the neighbors are at different distances, so we need to compute the number for each position.

Note that some of these positions might not be filled yet or might be in inner rings, but since 2026 is at ring 23, and neighbors could be in ring 22 or 23 or 24, but ring 24 is outer, not yet filled, but since 2026 is the first of ring 23, ring 24 hasn't started yet, so neighbors in ring 24 are not present. But in the spiral, numbers are filled sequentially, so when we place 2026, the neighbors that are already filled are those with smaller numbers, so they must be in rings ≤23.

Specifically, since ring 23 starts at 2026, all numbers before are in rings up to 22.

Ring 22 ends at (2*22 +1)^2 = 45^2? Earlier ring k ends at (2k+1)^2.

Ring k: ends at (2k+1)^2.

Ring 22: ends at (2*22 +1)^2 = (44+1)^2=45^2=2025.

And ring 23 starts at 2026.

So all numbers less than 2026 are in rings ≤22.

Now, the neighbors of (23,-22) are:

As above: (22,-23), (22,-22), (22,-21), (23,-23), (23,-21), (24,-23), (24,-22), (24,-21)

Now, which of these have numbers? Since numbers are only defined for cells that are filled, i.e., for cells in rings ≤23, but ring 23 just started, only (23,-22) is filled with 2026, and others in ring 23 are not yet filled. In fact, since we just placed 2026, the next numbers will be placed in ring 23, but not yet.

So, only cells that are in rings ≤22 have numbers.

So, we need to check for each neighbor position, what ring it belongs to, and if ring ≤22, then it has a number, else not.

The ring of a cell (x,y) is given by r = max(|x|, |y|)

Since the ring is defined by max(|x|,|y|).

For example, (0,0): max=0, ring 0.

(1,0): max=1, ring 1.

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ring 2.

(2,2): max=2, ring 2.

(3,-2): max(3,2)=3, ring 3.

So yes, ring r = max(|x|,|y|)

Now, for our neighbors:

1. (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23

2. (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22

3. (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22

4. (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23

5. (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23

6. (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24

7. (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24

8. (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24

Now, ring r ≤22 for having a number. So max(|x|,|y|) ≤22.

Look at each:

1. max=23 >22, so no number (in ring 23 or higher, not filled yet)

2. max=22, so ring 22, has number

3. max=22, ring 22

4. max=23 >22, no number

5. max=23 >22, no number

6. max=24 >22, no number

7. max=24 >22, no number

8. max=24 >22, no number

So only neighbors 2 and 3 have numbers: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

But that's only two neighbors? But there should be more. What about (23,-23)? max=23, not filled. But intuitively, since it's the start, neighbors should include cells from previous ring.

For example, consider a smaller case. Suppose we take number 2, which is first of ring 1, at (1,0). Its neighbors: eight neighbors:

(0,-1), (0,0), (0,1),

(1,-1), (1,1),

(2,-1), (2,0), (2,1)

Now, at this point, when 2 is placed, what is filled? Only ring 0: (0,0)=1. Ring 1 just started with (1,0)=2.

So filled cells: (0,0) and (1,0).

Neighbors:

(0,-1): not filled

(0,0): filled, number 1

(0,1): not filled

(1,-1): not filled

(1,1): not filled

(2,-1): not filled

(2,0): not filled

(2,1): not filled

So only one neighbor is filled: (0,0) with 1.

But the problem asks for eight neighbors, but in this case, only one is present. But for 2026, similarly, only some neighbors might be present.

But in the problem, for any number, its eight adjacent cells, but some may not be filled yet, but in the spiral, since it's infinite, all adjacent cells are eventually filled, but at the time when we place 2026, only rings ≤22 are filled, and ring 23 has only (23,-22) filled so far.

So for the neighbors, only those in rings ≤22 have numbers, others do not yet have numbers, so they are not part of the spiral yet? But the problem probably assumes that we consider the grid positions, and if a neighbor is not yet filled, it doesn't have a number, but since the spiral is filled sequentially, and we are at 2026, the neighbors that are not filled yet will be filled later with larger numbers, but for the sum of neighbors, we need the numbers that are already there when we place 2026, so only the existing neighbors.

But in the case of 2, it has only one neighbor (1), but the problem asks for sum of all eight neighbors, implying that for 2026, some neighbors are filled.

In our calculation for (23,-22), we have (22,-22) and (22,-21) with max=22, so ring 22, filled.

But are there more? What about (23,-23)? max=23, not filled. But (22,-23) max=23, not filled. What about (21,-22)? That's not in the list; the neighbors are only the eight adjacent, which we listed.

But (21,-22) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side or corner, so distance 1 in max norm, but in grid, neighbors are exactly the eight cells we listed for (a,b).

But for (23,-22), we have (22,-23) etc., but as calculated, only (22,-22) and (22,-21) have max=22 ≤22.

But max=22 for both, but are there others? (23,-21) has |x|=23,|y|=21, max=23>22, not filled.

But what about cells like (22,-22), (22,-21), but also (21,-22), (21,-21), etc.? But those are not adjacent to (23,-22).

For example, (21,-22) is at distance |23-21| + |-22-(-22)| =2+0=2 in Manhattan, or max norm max(2,0)=2, so not adjacent.

Adjacent cells are only those with |dx|≤1 and |dy|≤1, which is what we have.

So only two neighbors are filled: (22,-22) and (22,-21).

But that seems too few, and for a number in the corner, it should have fewer neighbors, but in this case, (23,-22) is not a corner; in the ring, it's the start, which for ring k, (k,1-k), for k=23, (23,-22), which is on the bottom row? y=-22, x=23.

The ring has cells with max(|x|,|y|)=23, so this cell has |x|=23, |y|=22, so max=23, so it's on the right edge, not corner, since |y|=22<23, so not corner; corners are where |x|=23 and |y|=23.

So it should have more neighbors. But according to calculation, only two are filled.

Perhaps I missed some neighbors that are in inner rings.

For example, (23,-23)? But max=23, not filled.

(24,-22) not filled.

But what about (22,-22), which is filled, and (22,-21), filled, but also (23,-22) itself, but that's the cell itself, not neighbor.

Neighbors are other cells.

Perhaps (21,-22), but not adjacent.

Let's calculate the relative positions.

Cell A: (23,-22)

Neighbor B: (22,-22) — dx=-1, dy=0

C: (22,-21) — dx=-1, dy=+1

D: (22,-23) — dx=-1, dy=-1

E: (23,-21) — dx=0, dy=+1

F: (23,-23) — dx=0, dy=-1

G: (24,-22) — dx=+1, dy=0

H: (24,-21) — dx=+1, dy=+1

I: (24,-23) — dx=+1, dy=-1

All eight.

Now, as above, only B and C have max(|x|,|y|)= max(22,22)=22 for B, max(22,21)=22 for C, both ring 22.

Others: D: max(22,23)=23>22

E: max(23,21)=23>22

F: max(23,23)=23>22

G: max(24,22)=24>22

H: max(24,21)=24>22

I: max(24,23)=24>22

So only B and C are in ring 22 or less, specifically ring 22.

But is there a neighbor in ring 21 or lower? For example, (23,-22) is at ring 23, neighbors could be at ring 22 or 23 or 24, but ring 24 not filled, ring 23 only itself filled, so only ring 22 and lower.

But in this case, the neighbors B and C are at (22,-22) and (22,-21), both with max=22, so ring 22.

But are there neighbors with lower ring? For example, (22,-22) has max=22, but is there a cell like (23,-22) has neighbor (22,-22), which is ring 22, but also (21,-22) is not adjacent.

What about (23,-21)? max=23, not filled.

Or (24,-22), not filled.

But perhaps (22,-22) is adjacent, but also (23,-23) is not, but what about (21,-22)? Not adjacent.

Perhaps I need to see if there are neighbors with |x| or |y| less than 22, but still adjacent and filled.

For example, the cell (23,-22) is at x=23,y=-22.

The cell (24,-22) is not filled.

But the cell (22,-22) is filled, ring 22.

Now, is there a cell at (23,-21)? |x|=23,|y|=21, max=23, not filled yet.

Cell at (21,-22): |x|=21,|y|=22, max=22, so ring 22, and it is adjacent to (22,-22)? But not to (23,-22).

Distance from (23,-22) to (21,-22): |dx|=2, |dy|=0, so not adjacent; it's two steps away.

Similarly, (22,-20): |x|=22,|y|=20, max=22, ring 22, but distance |dx|=1, |dy|=2, max norm 2, not adjacent.

So only the cells we listed are adjacent, and only two are filled.

But for the sum, we need to sum the numbers at those positions, but only two are present, so sum is sum of numbers at (22,-22) and (22,-21).

But that seems too small, and probably not what the problem intends, because for a number in the spiral, most neighbors are filled when it is placed, but in this case, since it's the first of the ring, many are not filled yet.

Perhaps for the purpose of the problem, we consider the grid as fully filled, so all cells have numbers, and we need to find the numbers at those positions, even if they are filled later.

That makes sense, because the problem is about the grid with all natural numbers, so the spiral is infinite, and all cells are eventually filled, so for any cell, its neighbors have numbers, and we can find what numbers are there.

In that case, for the cell containing 2026, which is at (23,-22), its eight neighbors are as listed, and we need to find the numbers at those positions, regardless of when they are filled.

So we need to compute the number for each of the eight positions: (22,-23), (22,-22), (22,-21), (23,-23), (23,-21), (24,-23), (24,-22), (24,-21)

And sum them up.

Since the spiral is symmetric, but the positions are different, we need to compute for each.

To find the number at a given position (x,y), we need to find which ring it is in, and then its position in the ring, and then the number.

Ring r = max(|x|,|y|)

Then, within the ring, we need to find the index.

The ring r has first number f(r) = (2r-1)^2 + 1

And total cells in ring r is 8r.

Now, the position in the ring depends on which side it is on and the offset.

The ring r starts at (r, 1-r)

Then moves north to (r,r), then west to (-r,r), then south to (-r,-r), then east to (r,-r)

The path is as described earlier.

To find the sequence, we can find the cumulative steps.

Define the start of ring r: position (r, 1-r), number f(r) = (2r-1)^2 + 1

Then, the ring is traversed in four legs:

1. North: from (r, 1-r) to (r,r). The y-coordinates from 1-r to r.

Number of cells in this leg: as we move, we add cells from y=1-r+1 to y=r? Earlier we had that from start, we move north for (2r-1) steps, adding (2r-1) cells, but including the start? No.

At the start, we are at (r,1-r), number f(r).

Then we move north to (r,1-r+1), (r,1-r+2), ..., up to (r,r)

The y-values: start at y_s = 1-r

End at y_e = r

The sequence of y: y_s, y_s+1, ..., y_e

Number of cells: y_e - y_s + 1 = r - (1-r) + 1 = r -1 + r +1 = 2r

But this includes the start. Since we start at the first cell, when we move, we add new cells.

In the north leg, the cells covered are all (r,y) for y = 1-r to r inclusive.

Number of cells: from y=1-r to y=r, inclusive, so r - (1-r) + 1 = r -1 + r +1 = 2r cells.

But for r=1: y from 1-1=0 to 1, so y=0,1: cells (1,0),(1,1) — but in ring 1, these are the first two cells: 2 and 3.

But earlier we said start at (1,0)=2, then move north to (1,1)=3, so two cells in north leg.

But in our earlier general description for ring k, north leg had only (2k-1) cells added? For k=1, 2*1-1=1 cell added, but here we have two cells including start.

Inconsistency.

For ring r, the north leg consists of the cells from (r,1-r) to (r,r), which is 2r cells.

For r=1: 2 cells: (1,0),(1,1)

For r=2: y from 1-2=-1 to 2, so y=-1,0,1,2: four cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)

But earlier for r=2, start at (2,-1)=10, then move north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13, so three cells added, but total four cells in the leg, including start.

The number assigned: the first cell of the leg is f(r), then next is f(r)+1, etc.

So for a cell in the north leg, at (r,y), the number is f(r) + (y - (1-r))

Since y starts at 1-r, so offset = y - (1-r)

Then number = f(r) + offset

For example, r=1, f(1)=2, cell (1,y): for y=0 (start), offset=0- (1-1)=0-0=0, number=2+0=2

y=1, offset=1-0=1, number=2+1=3, good.

For r=2, f(2)= (2*2-1)^2 +1=3^2+1=10

Cell (2,y): y from -1 to 2

y=-1: offset= -1 - (1-2) = -1 - (-1) = -1+1=0, number=10+0=10

y=0: offset=0 - (-1)=1, number=11

y=1: offset=1-(-1)=2, number=12

y=2: offset=2-(-1)=3, number=13, good.

Now, after north leg, we move west to (r-1,r), (r-2,r), ..., (-r,r)

From (r,r) to (-r,r), x from r down to -r.

x starts at r, ends at -r.

Cells: (r,r), (r-1,r), ..., (-r,r)

Number of cells: r - (-r) + 1 = 2r+1 cells? But for r=1: x from 1 to -1: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1) — three cells, but 2*1+1=3, yes.

But earlier for ring r, total cells 8r, north leg has 2r cells, west leg should have how many?

For r=1: north:2 cells, west: should be next cells: after (1,1), move west to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, so two cells? But according to above, three cells? Contradiction.

Problem.

In r=1, after (1,1)=3, move west to (0,1)=4, then to (-1,1)=5, so two cells: (0,1) and (-1,1).

But according to the list from (r,r)=(1,1) to (-r,r)=(-1,1), which is two cells if we include both, but from x=1 to x=-1, with x decreasing, cells x=1,0,-1, so three cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1)

But in the path, (1,1) is already occupied by the last cell of north leg, so when we start west leg, we are at (1,1), and we move to new cells: (0,1), then (-1,1), so only two new cells, but the cell (1,1) is already included in the north leg.

So for the west leg, the cells are from x=r-1 down to -r at y=r, so x from r-1 to -r inclusive.

For r=1: x from 1-1=0 to -1, so x=0,-1: cells (0,1),(-1,1)

Number of cells: from x=0 to x=-1, inclusive, so |0 - (-1)| +1 =2 cells.

General: x from r-1 down to -r, so min x= -r, max x= r-1, number of cells: (r-1) - (-r) +1 = r-1 +r +1 = 2r

For r=1, 2*1=2 cells, good.

For r=2: x from 2-1=1 to -2, so x=1,0,-1,-2: cells (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — four cells, 2r=4, good.

The first cell of west leg is at (r-1,r)? For r=1, (0,1), for r=2, (1,2)

The number: the west leg starts after the north leg. North leg has 2r cells, from number f(r) to f(r) + (2r - 1)

For r=1: north leg: cells 2 and 3, so numbers f(r) to f(r)+1? 2 to 3, so inclusive, f(r) to f(r) + (2r -1) =2 to 2+1=3? 2r-1=1, f(r)+1=3, yes.

General: north leg has cells with numbers from f(r) to f(r) + (2r - 1)

Since there are 2r cells, numbers f(r) to f(r) + 2r - 1

For r=1: 2 to 3, yes f(r)+2r-1=2+2-1=3.

For r=2: 10 to 10+4-1=13, yes.

Then west leg starts at next number: f(r) + 2r

For r=1: f(1)+2*1=2+2=4, which is (0,1)

For r=2: f(2)+4=10+4=14, which is (1,2)? Earlier we have (2,-1)=10,(2,0)=11,(2,1)=12,(2,2)=13, then west to (1,2)=14, yes.

Now, for a cell in west leg, at (x,r), with x from r-1 down to -r.

x starts at r-1, ends at -r.

The offset: when x=r-1, it should be the first cell, number f(r)+2r

Then as x decreases, number increases.

The sequence: x=r-1, r-2, ..., -r

Number of steps: from x=r-1 to x=-r, delta x= -r - (r-1) = -2r+1, but number of cells: |r-1 - (-r)| +1 = |r-1 +r| +1 = |2r-1| +1 = 2r-1 +1=2r, since r≥1.

The values of x: let x_k = r-1 - k for k=0 to 2r-1? When k=0, x=r-1, k=1, x=r-2, ..., k=2r-1, x=r-1 - (2r-1) = -r

Yes, so k from 0 to 2r-1, x = r-1 - k

Then the number is f(r) + 2r + k

Since first cell k=0, number f(r)+2r

Then k=1, f(r)+2r+1, etc.

Since k = (r-1) - x

So number = f(r) + 2r + [(r-1) - x]

For example, r=1, cell (x,1): x from 0 to -1

For x=0: number = f(1) + 2*1 + [(1-1) - 0] = 2 + 2 + [0 - 0] =4? But should be 4, yes.

x=-1: number=2+2+[0 - (-1)]=4+1=5, good.

r=2, cell (x,2): for x=1: number=f(2)+4 + [(2-1)-1]=10+4+[1-1]=14+0=14

x=0:10+4+[1-0]=14+1=15

x=-1:10+4+[1-(-1)]=14+2=16

x=-2:10+4+[1-(-2)]=14+3=17, good.

After west leg, we move south to (-r,r-1), (-r,r-2), ..., (-r,-r)

From (-r,r) to (-r,-r), y from r down to -r.

But start at (-r,r), which is the last cell of west leg.

Then move south to (-r,r-1), (-r,r-2), ..., (-r,-r)

y starts at r, ends at -r, but (-r,r) is already occupied, so new cells from y=r-1 down to -r.

So y from r-1 to -r inclusive.

Number of cells: (r-1) - (-r) +1 = r-1 +r +1=2r

First cell at (-r,r-1), number: after west leg, west leg ends at f(r) + 2r + (2r -1) = f(r) + 4r -1

For r=1: f(1)+4*1-1=2+3=5, which is (-1,1)

Then south leg starts at next number: f(r) + 4r

For r=1: f(1)+4=6, which should be (-1,0)

For r=2: west leg ends at (-2,2)=17? Earlier (1,2)=14,(0,2)=15,(-1,2)=16,(-2,2)=17

Then south leg starts at (-2,1)=18? Since y=r-1=1

Number f(2)+4*2=10+8=18, yes.

General: south leg starts at number f(r) + 4r

Cells: (-r,y) for y from r-1 down to -r.

y starts at r-1, decreases to -r.

Set y_j = r-1 - j for j=0 to 2r-1? j=0, y=r-1; j=1,y=r-2; ... j=2r-1,y=r-1-(2r-1)= -r

Yes.

Number: first cell j=0, number f(r)+4r

Then j=1, f(r)+4r+1, etc.

So number = f(r) + 4r + j = f(r) + 4r + [(r-1) - y]

Since j = (r-1) - y

For r=1: cell (-1,y), y from 0 to -1? r-1=0, to -r=-1

y=0: number=f(1)+4*1 + [(1-1)-0]=2+4+[0-0]=6

y=-1:2+4+[0-(-1)]=6+1=7, good.

r=2: (-2,y), y from 1 to -2? r-1=1, -r=-2

y=1: f(2)+8 + [(2-1)-1]=10+8+[1-1]=18

y=0:10+8+[1-0]=19

y=-1:10+8+[1-(-1)]=18+2=20? 10+8+2=20

y=-2:10+8+[1-(-2)]=18+3=21, good.

After south leg, we move east to (-r+1,-r), (-r+2,-r), ..., (r,-r)

From (-r,-r) to (r,-r), x from -r to r.

But (-r,-r) is last of south leg, so new cells from x=-r+1 to r.

x from -(r-1) to r? From -r+1 to r.

Number of cells: r - (-r+1) +1 = r + r -1 +1 = 2r

First cell at (-r+1, -r), number: south leg ends at f(r) + 4r + (2r -1) = f(r) + 6r -1

For r=1: f(1)+6-1=2+5=7, (-1,-1)

Then east leg starts at f(r)+6r? f(1)+6=8, (0,-1)

For r=2: south leg ends at (-2,-2)=21? Earlier (-2,1)=18,(-2,0)=19,(-2,-1)=20,(-2,-2)=21

Then east leg: (-1,-2)=22? Number f(2)+12=10+12=22

Cells: x from -1 to 2? -r+1= -2+1=-1, to r=2

So x=-1,0,1,2: (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2)

Numbers:22,23,24,25? Since ends at (r,-r)=(2,-2), which is end of ring.

Number: f(r)+6r + k, where k=0 to 2r-1

x starts at -r+1, increases to r.

Set x_m = -r+1 + m for m=0 to 2r-1? m=0, x=-r+1; m=1,x=-r+2; ... m=2r-1,x=-r+1+2r-1=r

Yes.

Number: first cell m=0, number f(r)+6r

Then m=1, f(r)+6r+1, etc.

So number = f(r) + 6r + m = f(r) + 6r + [x - (-r+1)]

Since m = x - (-r+1) = x + r -1

For r=1: cell (x,-1), x from 0 to 1? -r+1=0, r=1

x=0: number=f(1)+6*1 + [0 +1 -1]=2+6+0=8

x=1:2+6+[1+1-1]=8+1=9, good.

r=2: x from -1 to 2

x=-1: f(2)+12 + [-1 +2 -1]=10+12+0=22

x=0:10+12+[0+2-1]=22+1=23

x=1:22+2? 10+12+[1+2-1]=22+2=24? Earlier should be 24

x=2:10+12+[2+2-1]=22+3=25, good.

Now, we have covered all cells in the ring.

To summarize, for a cell (x,y) in ring r = max(|x|,|y|)

To find the number:

First, determine which leg it is in, based on the position.

- If |x| = r and |y| < r, but specifically:

The legs:

- North leg: x = r, y from 1-r to r

- West leg: y = r, x from r-1 down to -r? But x from -r to r-1, but not including corners? Actually, in north leg, when y=r, it's included, so for west leg, x < r, since (r,r) is in north.

Similarly, corners are assigned to the first leg they encounter.

In our case:

- North leg: all cells with x = r, and y between 1-r and r inclusive.

- West leg: all cells with y = r, and x between -r and r-1 inclusive? But when x=r, it's in north, so for west leg, y=r and x < r, i.e., x ≤ r-1.

In r=2, west leg: y=2, x=1,0,-1,-2? But x=r=2 is in north leg (since (2,2) is north).

So west leg: y=r, x from -r to r-1 inclusive.

Similarly, south leg: x = -r, y from -r to r-1 inclusive? Since y=r is in west leg.

In r=2, south leg: x=-2, y=1,0,-1,-2? But y=2 is in west leg, so south leg: x=-r, y from -r to r-1 inclusive.

East leg: y = -r, x from -r+1 to r inclusive? Since x=-r is in south leg.

In r=2, east leg: y=-2, x=-1,0,1,2? x=-2 is south leg.

Now, for each leg, we have the formula.

Now, for our neighbors, we need to compute for each position.

Recall that for the cell with 2026, it is at (23,-22), ring r=23.

But for neighbors, they may be in different rings.

List the neighbors and their rings:

As before:

1. (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, so ring 23

2. (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, ring 22

3. (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, ring 22

4. (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23

5. (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23, ring 23

6. (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24, ring 24

7. (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24, ring 24

8. (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24, ring 24

Now, we need to find the number at each of these positions.

First, for ring 22: positions 2 and 3: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Ring r=22.

f(r) = (2r-1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

Now, position (22,-22): x=22,y=-22

Is this in north leg? North leg: x=r=22, y between 1-22=-21 and 22 inclusive.

y=-22, which is less than -21? 1-r=1-22=-21, so y from -21 to 22.

y=-22 < -21, so not in north leg.

West leg: y=r=22, x from -22 to 21? Since r-1=21.

But here y=-22 ≠22, so not west.

South leg: x=-r=-22, y from -22 to 21? r-1=21.

x=22 ≠ -22, so not south.

East leg: y=-r=-22, x from -21 to 22? -r+1=-21, to r=22.

Here y=-22, so could be in east leg.

East leg: y = -r = -22, x from -r+1 = -21 to r=22 inclusive.

So yes, (x,y) with y=-22, x from -21 to 22.

So (22,-22) is in east leg of ring 22.

For east leg, number = f(r) + 6r + [x - (-r + 1)] = f(r) + 6r + [x + r - 1]

Here r=22, f(r)=1850

x=22

So number = 1850 + 6*22 + [22 + 22 - 1] = 1850 + 132 + [43] = 1850 + 132 + 43

Compute: 1850+132=1982, +43=2025.

Is that right? Ring 22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, and since it's the last cell? For east leg, ends at (r,-r)=(22,-22), which is the end of the ring, so should be the last number, which is (2r+1)^2 = (44+1)^2=45^2=2025, yes. So number is 2025.

Now, next neighbor: (22,-21)

Same ring r=22.

Position (22,-21)

Is this in east leg? East leg: y=-22, but here y=-21 ≠ -22, so no.

North leg: x=22, y between -21 and 22. y=-21 is within -21 to 22? Yes, since inclusive.

y_min=1-r=1-22=-21, y_max=r=22, so y=-21 is included.

So in north leg.

For north leg, number = f(r) + [y - (1-r)] 

f(r)=1850

y - (1-r) = -21 - (1-22) = -21 - (-21) = -21 +21=0

So number=1850 + 0 =1850

But is that correct? North leg starts at (r,1-r)=(22,-21), which is exactly this point, and it should be the first cell of ring 22, so f(r)=1850, yes.

Now, next neighbors are in ring 23 and 24.

First, ring 23: positions 1,4,5: (22,-23), (23,-23), (23,-21)

r=23

f(r) = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026

Now, position (22,-23): x=22,y=-23

Ring r=23.

Which leg?

North leg: x=r=23? But here x=22<23, so no.

West leg: y=r=23? But y=-23 ≠23, no.

South leg: x=-r=-23? But x=22≠-23, no.

East leg: y=-r=-23? But y=-23, so possible. x from -r+1=-22 to r=23? Since r=23.

East leg: y=-23, x from -22 to 23 inclusive.

Here y=-23, x=22, which is within -22 to 23, yes.

So in east leg.

Number = f(r) + 6r + [x + r - 1]

f(r)=2026

r=23

x=22

So number=2026 + 6*23 + [22 + 23 - 1] = 2026 + 138 + [44] = 2026 + 138 + 44

Compute: 2026+138=2164, +44=2208.

Now, next: (23,-23)

Position (23,-23)

Ring r=23.

Which leg?

North leg: x=23, y between 1-23=-22 and 23 inclusive. y=-23 < -22? -23 < -22, so not in north.

West leg: y=23, x from -23 to 22? r-1=22. But y=-23 ≠23, no.

South leg: x=-23, y from -23 to 22? But x=23≠-23, no.

East leg: y=-23, x from -22 to 23. But y=-23, so yes? East leg is y=-r=-23, x from -r+1=-22 to r=23.

So (23,-23) is included? x=23, y=-23.

But is this a corner? Should be in south leg or east leg? In our assignment, south leg is x=-r, east leg is y=-r.

Here x=23, y=-23, so |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23.

In south leg: x must be -r=-23, but here x=23≠-23.

In east leg: y=-23, which matches, and x=23 is within -22 to 23, so yes, in east leg.

But (23,-23) is the bottom-right corner? For ring r, the corners: (r,r) in north leg, (-r,r) in west leg, (-r,-r) in south leg, (r,-r) in east leg.

Yes, so (r,-r) is in east leg, correct.

So number = f(r) + 6r + [x + r - 1] = 2026 + 6*23 + [23 + 23 - 1] = 2026 + 138 + [45] = 2026 + 138 + 45

2026+138=2164, +45=2209.

But ring 23 ends at (2r+1)^2=(46+1)^2=47^2=2209, and (23,-23) is the end point, so should be 2209, yes.

Now, next: (23,-21)

Position (23,-21)

Ring r=23.

Now, which leg?

North leg: x=23, y between -22 and 23 inclusive. y=-21 is within -22 to 23? Yes, since -22 ≤ -21 ≤ 23.

So in north leg.

Number = f(r) + [y - (1-r)] 

f(r)=2026

y - (1-r) = -21 - (1-23) = -21 - (-22) = -21 +22=1

So number=2026 + 1 =2027

Now, finally, the ring 24 neighbors: positions 6,7,8: (24,-23), (24,-22), (24,-21)

Ring r=24

f(r) = (2r-1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Now, position (24,-23): x=24,y=-23

Ring r=24.

Which leg?

North leg: x=r=24, y between 1-24=-23 and 24 inclusive. y=-23 is exactly the lower bound, since min y=1-r=-23.

So in north leg.

Number = f(r) + [y - (1-r)] = 2210 + [-23 - (1-24)] = 2210 + [-23 - (-23)] = 2210 + [-23 +23] = 2210 + 0 =2210

Which is the first number of ring 24, correct.

Now, (24,-22): same ring r=24.

Position (24,-22)

North leg: x=24, y between -23 and 24. y=-22 is within, since -23 ≤ -22 ≤ 24.

So north leg.

Number = f(r) + [y - (1-r)] = 2210 + [-22 - (1-24)] = 2210 + [-22 - (-23)] = 2210 + [-22 +23] = 2210 + 1 =2211

Now, (24,-21): (24,-21)

Still north leg? y=-21, which is greater than -23, less than 24, so yes.

Number = 2210 + [-21 - (1-24)] = 2210 + [-21 - (-23)] = 2210 + [-21 +23] = 2210 + 2 =2212

Now, we have all eight neighbors' numbers:

1. (22,-23): 2208

2. (22,-22): 2025

3. (22,-21): 1850

4. (23,-23): 2209

5. (23,-21): 2027

6. (24,-23): 2210

7. (24,-22): 2211

8. (24,-21): 2212

Now, sum them up.

List:

2208, 2025, 1850, 2209, 2027, 2210, 2211, 2212

Now, sum.

First, group them.

Notice that 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are consecutive almost.

2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 — that's five numbers: from 2208 to 2212.

Sum = (number of terms) * (first + last)/2 = 5 * (2208 + 2212)/2 = 5 * 4420 / 2 = 5 * 2210 = 11050

2208 + 2212 = 4420, divided by 2 is 2210, times 5 is 11050.

Now, the others: 2025, 1850, 2027

2025 and 2027 are close.

2025 + 2027 = 4052

Plus 1850.

So 4052 + 1850 = 5902

Now, total sum: 11050 + 5902 = 16952

But we have eight numbers, and 11050 is from five, plus three more: 2025,1850,2027.

But 1850 is there, yes.

So sum = 11050 + 5902 = 16952

But let me verify by adding all.

List again:

2208

2025

1850

2209

2027

2210

2211

2212

Add step by step.

Start with 2208 + 2025 = 4233

4233 + 1850 = 6083

6083 + 2209 = 8292

8292 + 2027 = 10319

10319 + 2210 = 12529

12529 + 2211 = 14740

14740 + 2212 = 16952

Same as before.

Now, is this correct? But in the sum, we have numbers from different rings, but that should be fine.

But let me check with a small example to verify the method.

Take the number 1 at (0,0). Its neighbors:

( -1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1),

(0,-1), (0,1),

(1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)

Numbers: according to spiral: ( -1,-1)=7? Earlier: (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9

So neighbors: (-1,-1)=7, (-1,0)=6, (-1,1)=5, (0,-1)=8, (0,1)=4, (1,-1)=9, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3

Sum: 7+6+5+8+4+9+2+3 = let's compute: 7+3=10, 6+4=10, 5+5? 5 is there, list: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? All numbers from 2 to 9.

Sum= 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = (2+9)*8/2? Sum from 1 to 9 is 45, minus 1 is 44? 2 to 9 is 44.

1+2+...+9=45, minus 1 is 44.

Now, according to our method, for cell (0,0), number 1, ring 0.

Neighbors: as above.

But in our case for 2026, we computed.

Now, another check: take number 2 at (1,0). Neighbors: as before, but when we consider all filled, neighbors are:

(0,-1)=8? (0,0)=1, (0,1)=4, (1,-1)=9, (1,1)=3, (2,-1)=10? (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12? Assuming ring 2 filled.

So neighbors: (0,-1)=8, (0,0)=1, (0,1)=4, (1,-1)=9, (1,1)=3, (2,-1)=10, (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12

Sum: 8+1+4+9+3+10+11+12

Compute: 1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12 = (1+12)+(3+11)+(4+10)+(8+9)=13+14+14+17=13+14=27, +14=41, +17=58

Now, according to formula, but we don't need, but for our sum, we got 16952 for 2026.

But in our list, we have numbers: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212

1850 is ring 22 start, 2025 is ring 22 end, 2027 is ring 23 north leg, etc.

Now sum is 16952.

But is there any mistake? Notice that (22,-21) is at ring 22, north leg, number 1850, which is correct.

(22,-22) at ring 22, east leg, end, 2025.

(22,-23) at ring 23, east leg, 2208.

(23,-23) at ring 23, east leg, end, 2209.

(23,-21) at ring 23, north leg, 2027.

(24,-23) at ring 24, north leg, start, 2210.

(24,-22) at ring 24, north leg, 2211.

(24,-21) at ring 24, north leg, 2212.

All seem correct.

Sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the sum again.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Sort them: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Now, sum:

1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952, same.

Notice that 2025 and 2027 are symmetric, but anyway.

So the sum is 16952.

But the problem is to sum the neighbors of 2026, and we have sum 16952.

But is 2026 included? No, neighbors are adjacent cells.

Now, perhaps box the answer.

But let me see if this makes sense.

Another way: since the neighbors are in rings 22,23,24, and we computed.

Note that for a cell on the "edge", but in this case, it might be correct.

I think it's fine.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me write it as boxed.

So \boxed{16952}

But I recall that in the initial small example for 1, sum is 44, which is correct.

For 2, if we compute with neighbors filled, sum is 58, as above.

Now, for 2026, we have sum 16952.

Perhaps compute the average, but not necessary.

I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (0,0) contains 1, and the spiral proceeds counterclockwise: right to (1,0)=2, up to (1,1)=3, left to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, and so on.

The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23)
- (22, -22)
- (22, -21)
- (23, -23)
- (23, -21)
- (24, -23)
- (24, -22)
- (24, -21)

The ring number for a cell (x,y) is given by \(r = \max(|x|, |y|)\). The numbers at these positions are calculated as follows:

- (22, -22): Ring \(r = \max(22, 22) = 22\). This cell is in the east leg. The first number of ring 22 is \(f(22) = (2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850\). The number is \(1850 + 6 \times 22 + [22 + 22 - 1] = 1850 + 132 + 43 = 2025\).
- (22, -21): Ring \(r = \max(22, 21) = 22\). This cell is in the north leg. The number is \(1850 + [-21 - (1 - 22)] = 1850 + [-21 - (-21)] = 1850 + 0 = 1850\).
- (22, -23): Ring \(r = \max(22, 23) = 23\). This cell is in the east leg. The first number of ring 23 is \(f(23) = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\). The number is \(2026 + 6 \times 23 + [22 + 23 - 1] = 2026 + 138 + 44 = 2208\).
- (23, -23): Ring \(r = \max(23, 23) = 23\). This cell is in the east leg. The number is \(2026 + 6 \times 23 + [23 + 23 - 1] = 2026 + 138 + 45 = 2209\).
- (23, -21): Ring \(r = \max(23, 21) = 23\). This cell is in the north leg. The number is \(2026 + [-21 - (1 - 23)] = 2026 + [-21 - (-22)] = 2026 + 1 = 2027\).
- (24, -23): Ring \(r = \max(24, 23) = 24\). This cell is in the north leg. The first number of ring 24 is \(f(24) = (2 \times 24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210\). The number is \(2210 + [-23 - (1 - 24)] = 2210 + [-23 - (-23)] = 2210 + 0 = 2210\).
- (24, -22): Ring \(r = \max(24, 22) = 24\). This cell is in the north leg. The number is \(2210 + [-22 - (1 - 24)] = 2210 + [-22 - (-23)] = 2210 + 1 = 2211\).
- (24, -21): Ring \(r = \max(24, 21) = 24\). This cell is in the north leg. The number is \(2210 + [-21 - (1 - 24)] = 2210 + [-21 - (-23)] = 2210 + 2 = 2212\).

The neighbors and their numbers are:
- (22, -23): 2208
- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -21): 1850
- (23, -23): 2209
- (23, -21): 2027
- (24, -23): 2210
- (24, -22): 2211
- (24, -21): 2212

Summing these numbers:
\[
2208 + 2025 + 1850 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952
\]

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
