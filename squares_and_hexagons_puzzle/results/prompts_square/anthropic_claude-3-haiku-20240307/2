To solve this problem, we need to find the neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then calculate the sum of their values.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid.
- The grid looks like this:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

Step 1: Locate the number 2026 on the grid.
The numbers on the spiral grid follow a specific pattern:
- The numbers start from 1 at the center and then spiral outward.
- The numbers on each side of the square increase by 1 as you move outward.

To find the location of 2026, we need to determine which square it is located in and its position within that square.

The number 2026 is located in the 45th square (the square with the numbers 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028).

Step 2: Identify the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- Top-left: 2025
- Top: 2027
- Top-right: 2028
- Left: 2019
- Right: 2029
- Bottom-left: 2015
- Bottom: 2013
- Bottom-right: 2014

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors.
Sum of the 8 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2019 + 2029 + 2015 + 2013 + 2014 = 16170.

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16170.
