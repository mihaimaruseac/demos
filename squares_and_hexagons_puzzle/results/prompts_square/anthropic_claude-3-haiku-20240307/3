To solve this problem, we need to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then calculate their sum.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid.
- The spiral starts from the center (1) and moves outward in a clockwise direction.

Step 1: Locate the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid.
The spiral grid can be divided into concentric squares, with the first square containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The second square contains the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The third square contains the numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12.
And so on.

To find the position of 2026, we need to determine the square it belongs to.
The first square has 4 numbers, the second square has 8 numbers, the third square has 12 numbers, and so on.
We can see that 2026 belongs to the 63rd square, which contains the numbers from 2025 to 2088.

Step 2: Identify the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2015, 2023, 2024, 2033

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors.
Sum of the 8 neighbors = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2015 + 2023 + 2024 + 2033 = 16,174

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,174.
