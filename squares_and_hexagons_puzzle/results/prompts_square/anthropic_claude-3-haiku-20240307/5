To solve this problem, we need to find the neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and calculate their sum.

Given information:
- The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid.
- The spiral starts with the number 1 at the center and continues outward.

Step 1: Determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid.
The spiral grid follows a pattern where the numbers increase in a clockwise direction. We can find the position of 2026 by finding the smallest perfect square that is greater than or equal to 2026, and then determining the position of the number within that square.

The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 2026 is 2025 (45^2).
The number 2026 is located in the 45th spiral, which means it is the 6th number in the 45th spiral.

Step 2: Identify the neighbors of the number 2026.
The 8 neighbors of the number 2026 are:
- Top left: 2025
- Top: 2024
- Top right: 2023
- Right: 2027
- Bottom right: 2029
- Bottom: 2031
- Bottom left: 2033
- Left: 2035

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors.
Sum of the 8 neighbors = 2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2027 + 2029 + 2031 + 2033 + 2035
= 16,227

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,227.
