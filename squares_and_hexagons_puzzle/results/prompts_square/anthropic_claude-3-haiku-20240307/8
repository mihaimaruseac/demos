To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the natural numbers written on a spiral laid out on a square grid.

The spiral starts with the number 1 at the center, and the subsequent numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, increasing by 1 as you move outward.

The 8 neighbors of a number in this grid are the 8 surrounding numbers, including the ones diagonally adjacent.

In this case, we are asked to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

To find the 8 neighbors, we can use the following steps:

1. Identify the position of the number 2026 in the grid.
2. Determine the 8 surrounding numbers.
3. Calculate the sum of those 8 numbers.

The position of the number 2026 in the grid can be found by following the spiral pattern. The numbers on the spiral go in the following order:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...

The 8 neighbors of the number 2026 are:
2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 2029, 2028, 2022, 2021

The sum of these 8 numbers is:
2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2027 + 2029 + 2028 + 2022 + 2021 = 16,179

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,179.
