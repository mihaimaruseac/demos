To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the natural numbers laid out on a spiral on a square grid.

The spiral pattern looks like this:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

The key observations are:
1. The numbers on the spiral increase by 1 as you move clockwise.
2. The numbers on the outer circle are one more than the previous inner circle.
3. The number 2026 is on the 2026th position in the spiral.

To find the 8 neighbors of 2026, we need to look at the positions immediately adjacent to it.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
1. The number to the left of 2026: 2025
2. The number to the right of 2026: 2027
3. The number above 2026: 2024
4. The number below 2026: 2028
5. The number diagonally above and to the left of 2026: 2023
6. The number diagonally above and to the right of 2026: 2022
7. The number diagonally below and to the left of 2026: 2029
8. The number diagonally below and to the right of 2026: 2030

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2022 + 2029 + 2030 = 16,178.
