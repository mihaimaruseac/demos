To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of the natural numbers on the square grid.

The spiral arrangement can be visualized as follows:

... 25 24 23 22 21 ...
... 26 9 8 7 20 ...
... 27 10 1 6 19 ...
... 28 11 2 5 18 ...
... 29 12 3 4 17 ...
... 30 13 14 15 16 ...

From this, we can observe that the number 2026 is located at the 45th position in the spiral.

The 8 neighbors of the number 2026 are:

1. The number directly above: 2021
2. The number directly below: 2031
3. The number directly to the left: 2025
4. The number directly to the right: 2027
5. The number diagonally above-left: 2020
6. The number diagonally above-right: 2022
7. The number diagonally below-left: 2030
8. The number diagonally below-right: 2032

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:

2021 + 2031 + 2025 + 2027 + 2020 + 2022 + 2030 + 2032 = 16,178.
