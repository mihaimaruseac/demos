To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral arrangement of natural numbers on the square grid.

The spiral arrangement starts with the number 1 at the center, and the subsequent numbers are arranged in a spiral, with the numbers increasing by 1 in a clockwise direction.

The number 2026 is located at the 2026th position in the spiral. To find the sum of its 8 neighbors, we need to identify the positions of the 8 neighboring numbers.

The 8 neighboring numbers of 2026 are:
- The numbers immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026.
- The numbers in the four diagonal positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right) of 2026.

To find the values of these 8 neighboring numbers, we can use the formula for the position of a number in the spiral:

Position = (row - 1) * 4 + (column - 1) + 1

Where:
- row is the row number (1 for the innermost row, 2 for the next row, and so on)
- column is the column number (1 for the leftmost column, 2 for the next column, and so on)

Applying this formula, we can find the positions and values of the 8 neighboring numbers of 2026:

1. Top-left neighbor: Position = (44 - 1) * 4 + (44 - 1) + 1 = 2025, so the value is 2025.
2. Top neighbor: Position = (44 - 1) * 4 + (45 - 1) + 1 = 2026, so the value is 2026.
3. Top-right neighbor: Position = (44 - 1) * 4 + (46 - 1) + 1 = 2027, so the value is 2027.
4. Left neighbor: Position = (45 - 1) * 4 + (44 - 1) + 1 = 2029, so the value is 2029.
5. Right neighbor: Position = (45 - 1) * 4 + (46 - 1) + 1 = 2031, so the value is 2031.
6. Bottom-left neighbor: Position = (46 - 1) * 4 + (44 - 1) + 1 = 2033, so the value is 2033.
7. Bottom neighbor: Position = (46 - 1) * 4 + (45 - 1) + 1 = 2034, so the value is 2034.
8. Bottom-right neighbor: Position = (46 - 1) * 4 + (46 - 1) + 1 = 2035, so the value is 2035.

The sum of these 8 neighboring numbers is:
2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2029 + 2031 + 2033 + 2034 + 2035 = 16,240.
