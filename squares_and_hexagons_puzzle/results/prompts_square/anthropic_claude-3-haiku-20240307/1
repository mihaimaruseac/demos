To solve this problem, we need to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid and then calculate the sum of their values.

The spiral grid is laid out on a square grid, where the numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, starting from the center.

The number 2026 is located at a specific position on the spiral grid. To find its 8 neighbors, we need to identify the position of 2026 and then determine the positions of its neighboring numbers.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Identify the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid.
2. Determine the positions of the 8 neighboring numbers around 2026.
3. Calculate the sum of the values of the 8 neighboring numbers.

Step 1: Identify the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid.
The spiral grid consists of concentric squares, where the innermost square has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each subsequent square has the numbers in a clockwise spiral pattern, with the numbers increasing by 4 from the previous square.

To find the position of 2026, we can divide 2026 by 4 to determine the number of the square it is in. 2026 / 4 = 506.5, which means 2026 is in the 507th square of the spiral grid.

Step 2: Determine the positions of the 8 neighboring numbers around 2026.
The 8 neighboring numbers of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the 4 diagonal neighbors.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the values of the 8 neighboring numbers.
The 8 neighboring numbers of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2021, 2029, 2020, 2030

The sum of these 8 numbers is:
2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2021 + 2029 + 2020 + 2030 = 16,204

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,204.
