To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral layout of the natural numbers on the square grid.

The spiral layout follows a specific pattern:
- The numbers start from the center (1) and spiral outwards.
- Each "ring" of the spiral has 8 numbers.
- The numbers in each ring increase by 4 from the previous ring.

Now, let's find the neighbors of the number 2026.

The number 2026 is located in the 253rd ring of the spiral.

The first number in the 253rd ring is 2025.
The last number in the 253rd ring is 2032.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025
- 2026 (the number itself)
- 2027
- 2028
- 2029
- 2030
- 2031
- 2032

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 = 16,198

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,198.
