To solve this problem, we need to first understand the pattern of the spiral layout of the natural numbers on the square grid.

The spiral starts at the center with the number 1, and then the numbers increase clockwise in a spiral pattern. The sequence of the numbers on the spiral is as follows:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...

Now, let's find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

The number 2026 is located at the following position on the spiral:

... 2025 2024 2023 ...
... 2026 2021 2022 ...
... 2027 2028 2029 ...

Therefore, the 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2024, 2023, 2021, 2022, 2027, 2028, 2029

To find the sum of these 8 numbers, we can simply add them up:

2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2021 + 2022 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 16,199

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,199.
