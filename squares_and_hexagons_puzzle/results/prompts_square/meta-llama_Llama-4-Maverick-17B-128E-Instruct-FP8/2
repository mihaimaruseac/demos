## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a square grid with the numbers starting from 1 and increasing in a spiral pattern. To understand the pattern, we first identify the positions of the numbers. The number 1 is at the center, and the spiral expands outward.

## Step 2: Identify the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the position of 2026, we need to understand how the spiral is constructed. The spiral starts with 1 at the center. The first loop around the center contains the numbers 2 to 9 (8 numbers), the second loop contains the numbers 10 to 25 (16 numbers), and so on. The $n^{th}$ loop contains $8n$ numbers. The total number of elements up to and including the $n^{th}$ loop is given by $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)^2$. We need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$ because 2026 will be in the $n^{th}$ loop.

## Step 3: Calculate the loop number for 2026
Let's calculate $n$ for 2026. We have $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$. So, $2n-1 < \sqrt{2026} \leq 2n+1$. Calculating $\sqrt{2026}$ gives approximately $45.01$. Thus, $2n-1 < 45.01 \leq 2n+1$, which simplifies to $22.505 < n \leq 23.005$. Hence, $n = 23$ because $n$ must be an integer.

## Step 4: Determine the exact position of 2026 within its loop
Since $n = 23$, the loop starts at $(2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026$. This means 2026 is the first number in the $23^{rd}$ loop, and it is on the right side of the grid, directly to the right of the center of the right edge of the $22^{nd}$ loop.

## Step 5: Identify the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally adjacent to it. Since 2026 is at the start of the $23^{rd}$ loop and is on the right edge, we need to understand its grid position. The number 2026 is at $(n, n-1)$ if we consider the center as $(0,0)$ and the grid positions as $(x, y)$.

## Step 6: Calculate the grid position of 2026
For $n = 23$, the first number of the loop is at $(23, 22)$ if we were counting from $(0,0)$ as the center. However, to simplify, let's directly analyze the pattern. The first number of the $n^{th}$ loop is at $(n, n-1)$, so 2026 is at $(23, 22)$.

## Step 7: List the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are: $(23, 21)$, $(23, 23)$, $(22, 22)$, $(22, 21)$, $(22, 23)$, $(24, 22)$, $(24, 21)$, and $(24, 23)$. We need to calculate the numbers at these positions.

## Step 8: Calculate the numbers at the neighboring positions
To find the numbers at these positions, we need to understand the pattern of numbering. The numbers are: 2025 (at $(22, 22)$), 2027 (at $(23, 23)$), 2024 (at $(22, 21)$), 2048 (at $(24, 22)$), 2047 (at $(24, 21)$), and 2049 (at $(24, 23)$). For $(23, 21)$ and $(22, 23)$, we need to calculate the values.

## Step 9: Calculate the value at $(23, 21)$
The value at $(23, 21)$ is the number just before 2026 in the spiral, which is 2025.

## Step 10: Calculate the numbers at the remaining neighboring positions
- At $(23, 21)$: 2025
- At $(23, 23)$: 2027
- At $(22, 22)$: 1981 (since it's the last number of the $22^{nd}$ loop, and the first number of the $22^{nd}$ loop is $44^2 + 1 = 1937$, so the last is $1937 + 8*22 - 1 = 1981 + 8*22 - 8 = 1981$ directly or by understanding it's $45^2 - 44 = 2026 - 45 = 1981$)
- At $(22, 21)$: 1980 (one less than 1981)
- At $(22, 23)$: 2009 (since the sequence goes up as we move down, and 2026 is the start of the loop, we count back: 2026, 2025, ..., 2009)
- At $(24, 22)$: 2048 (as it's the next number after 2047)
- At $(24, 21)$: 2047
- At $(24, 23)$: 2049

## Step 11: Sum the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 1981, 1980, 2009, 2048, 2047, 2049.
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1980 + 2009 + 2048 + 2047 + 2049.

## Step 12: Perform the sum
Sum = 2025 + 2027 = 4052, 4052 + 1981 = 6033, 6033 + 1980 = 8013, 8013 + 2009 = 10022, 10022 + 2048 = 12070, 12070 + 2047 = 14117, 14117 + 2049 = 16166.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16166}$
