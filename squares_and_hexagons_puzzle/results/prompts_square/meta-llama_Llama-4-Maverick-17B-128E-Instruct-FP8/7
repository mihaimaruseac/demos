## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The spiral is laid out on a square grid, starting with 1 in the center. The numbers are filled in a spiral pattern, moving clockwise. To understand the pattern, let's first identify the positions of the numbers around 1. The number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We need to analyze how the numbers are distributed around any given number.

## Step 2: Determine the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located
To find the sum of the neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 on the spiral. The spiral can be visualized as layers around the center. The first layer contains 1 number (1), the second layer contains 8 numbers (2-9), the third layer contains 16 numbers (10-25), and so on. The nth layer contains $8(n-1)$ numbers, and the total numbers up to and including the nth layer is $1 + 8 + 16 + ... + 8(n-1) = 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = 1 + 8\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 = (2n-1)^2$. We need to find n such that $(2n-1)^2$ is just greater than or equal to 2026.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer for 2026
Let's solve for n when $(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026$. We have $(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026$, so $2n-1 \geq \sqrt{2026}$. Calculating, $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$, so $2n-1 \geq 45.01$, thus $2n \geq 46.01$, and $n \geq 23.005$. Therefore, $n = 23$ because n must be an integer.

## Step 4: Verify that 2026 is within the 23rd layer
For $n = 23$, the start of the layer is $(2*22-1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$ and the end is $(2*23-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. So, 2026 is actually just outside the 23rd layer, meaning it is in the 24th layer, but since 2025 is the last number of the 23rd layer, 2026 is the first number of the 24th layer.

## Step 5: Identify the position of 2026 in the 24th layer
Since 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer, we need to understand the layout of this layer. The 24th layer starts with 2026. The numbers in this layer are distributed as follows: the first number (2026) is on the top-left corner of the layer, and the layer contains numbers from 2026 to $(2*24-1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$.

## Step 6: Determine the neighbors of 2026
2026 is at the start of the 24th layer. The neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally adjacent to it. Since 2026 is the first number in the layer, it is on the top-left corner. The numbers directly above and to the left of 2026 are in the previous layer (23rd layer). The number directly above 2026 is 1994 (since 2026 - 32 = 1994, because the difference between the first number of a layer and the number directly above it is the difference between the layer's start and the previous layer's start, which is related to the layer number), and to the left is 2025. The number to the right is 2027.

## Step 7: Calculate the exact neighbors of 2026
To find the neighbors, let's first identify the numbers around 2026. The number above 2026 is 1994. The numbers to the left and right of 2026 are 2025 and 2027, respectively. The number below 2026 is 2058 (since the layer size is 8*(24-1) = 184, and the first number of the layer is 2026, the number directly below it is 2026 + 184/4 = 2026 + 46 = 2072, but we need to understand the pattern to correctly identify all neighbors).

## Step 8: Correctly identify all 8 neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are: above (1994), below (2058), left (2025), right (2027), and the four diagonals. The diagonal neighbors can be found by understanding the pattern. The top-right neighbor is 1995 (1994 + 1), the top-left neighbor is 1963 (since it's diagonally up and to the left from 2026, and considering the spiral pattern, we need to go back 32 numbers and then one more to the left, so 2026 - 32 - 31 = 1963), the bottom-left neighbor is 2057 (2025 + 32), and the bottom-right neighbor is 2059 (2027 + 32).

## Step 9: Sum the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are 1994, 1963, 2025, 1995, 2027, 2059, 2057, 2058. Let's sum them: $1994 + 1963 + 2025 + 1995 + 2027 + 2059 + 2057 + 2058$.

## Step 10: Perform the summation
$1994 + 1963 = 3957$, $3957 + 2025 = 5982$, $5982 + 1995 = 7977$, $7977 + 2027 = 10004$, $10004 + 2059 = 12063$, $12063 + 2057 = 14120$, $14120 + 2058 = 16178$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16178}$
