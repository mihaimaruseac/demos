## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 at the center, and the numbers are arranged in a spiral manner. To understand the pattern, let's first identify the positions of the numbers around 1. The number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We need to analyze how the numbers are distributed in the grid.

## Step 2: Identify the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located
To find the sum of the neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral. The spiral is constructed in layers around the center. The first layer contains 1 (1 number), the second layer contains numbers 2 to 9 (8 numbers), the third layer contains numbers 10 to 25 (16 numbers), and so on. The nth layer contains $8n$ numbers (for $n \geq 1$) and starts with the number $(2n-1)^2 + 1$ and ends with $(2n+1)^2$. We need to determine in which layer 2026 is located.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer number for 2026
To find the layer where 2026 is, we need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$. Let's start by checking the value of $n$ for which $(2n+1)^2$ is just greater than or equal to 2026.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the layer
Let's calculate: For $n = 22$, $(2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. This means 2025 is the last number of the 22nd layer, and 2026 is the first number of the 23rd layer.

## Step 5: Determine the position of 2026 in its layer
Since 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, it is located at the top-right corner of the layer (if we consider the spiral's orientation). The numbers in the 23rd layer start from 2026 and end at $47^2 = 2209$. The sequence in this layer will be 2026, 2027, ..., 2209.

## Step 6: Identify the neighbors of 2026
2026 is at the start of the 23rd layer. Its neighbors will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and diagonally adjacent to it. Since 2026 is the first number in its layer and is on the right edge of the spiral at that layer, we need to understand its position relative to the previous layer.

## Step 7: Calculate the neighbors of 2026
The number directly above 2026 is in the previous layer. To find it, we need to understand the structure. The last number of the 22nd layer is 2025, which is directly above 2026. The numbers surrounding 2026 are: 2025 (above), 2027 (to the right), and the numbers diagonally and directly adjacent to it. We need to identify these numbers based on the spiral pattern.

## Step 8: Analyze the spiral pattern around 2026
The numbers around 2026 are: 2025 (above), 1981 (above-left), 1980 (left), 1937 (below-left), 1936 (below), 1937 + 1 = 1938 (below-right, but we need to check the actual number), 2027 (right), and 2069 (above-right, but again, we need the actual number). Let's directly calculate the neighbors.

## Step 9: Directly calculate the neighbors
- The number above 2026 is 2025.
- The number to the right of 2026 is 2027.
- To find the other neighbors, we need to understand that 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer. So, the numbers directly adjacent to it (horizontally and vertically) and diagonally are related to the numbers in the 22nd and 23rd layers.

## Step 10: Calculate the specific neighbors of 2026
2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer. So, its neighbors are:
- Above: 2025
- Above-right: 2069 (since it's the start of the layer, it's on the right edge, and the number above-right is in the next layer, but we need to check the pattern)
- Right: 2027
- Below-right: The number below 2027 is 2083 (since 2027 is the second number in the layer, and the layer below it starts at 2026 + 1 + (the difference between the start of the next layer and the current number), but directly below 2027 is 2083).
- Below: 1937 (since 2026 - 2025 = 1, and the difference between consecutive layers' start is related to the layer number)
- Below-left: 1936 (the number before 1937)
- Left: 1980 (since it's directly to the left, and related to the previous layer)
- Above-left: 1981 (the number above 1980)

Let's directly identify the numbers:
- 2025 (above)
- 1981 (above-left)
- 1980 (left)
- 1936 (below-left)
- 1937 (below)
- 2083 (below-right, as 2027 is the next number, and the one below it is 2083)
- 2027 (right)
- 2069 (above-right, as the pattern continues)

## Step 11: Sum the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are 2025, 1981, 1980, 1936, 1937, 2083, 2027, and 2069. Let's sum them:
2025 + 1981 = 4006
4006 + 1980 = 5986
5986 + 1936 = 7922
7922 + 1937 = 9859
9859 + 2083 = 11942
11942 + 2027 = 13969
13969 + 2069 = 16038

The final answer is: $\boxed{16038}$
