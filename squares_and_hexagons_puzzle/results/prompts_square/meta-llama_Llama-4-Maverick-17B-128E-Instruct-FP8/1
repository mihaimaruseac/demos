## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 at the center, and the numbers are arranged in a spiral manner. To understand the pattern, let's first identify how the numbers are distributed around the center. The sequence given is: ... 5 4 3 ..., ... 6 1 2 ..., ... 7 8 9 ..., indicating that the numbers spiral outward.

## Step 2: Determine the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located
To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 on the spiral. The spiral is laid out such that the numbers on the diagonals (from the center outwards) are related to the square numbers. The $n$th layer around the center contains $(2n+1)^2$ as the largest number on the layer. We need to find $n$ for which $2026$ falls.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer number for 2026
The largest number in the $n$th layer is $(2n+1)^2$. We need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$ because 2026 should be within or at the boundary of the $n$th layer. Let's check: For $n = 22$, $(2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. This means 2026 is on the layer just outside the 22nd layer, so $n = 23$ is not correct for 2025, but it is the layer for numbers just larger than 2025.

## Step 4: Identify the position of 2026 on the spiral
Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2026 is the first number on the next layer (the 23rd layer), which starts after 2025. The numbers on this layer are arranged in a specific pattern: the first number is on the right side of the grid, and then the spiral continues upwards, leftwards, downwards, and then rightwards again.

## Step 5: Locate the neighbors of 2026
2026 is the first number on the 23rd layer. The layer starts with 2026 on the right side of the previous layer's corner (2025). So, 2026 is to the right of 2025. The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the four diagonals. Since 2026 is at the start of the layer, its neighbors include numbers from the previous layer and the current layer.

## Step 6: Calculate the neighbors of 2026
The number to the left of 2026 is 2025. The numbers above and below 2026, and to its right, as well as the diagonals, need to be determined based on the spiral pattern. For a number at the start of a layer, the neighbors can be derived from understanding the spiral's structure.

## Step 7: Derive the neighbors based on the spiral structure
2026 is on the right side of the layer that starts with 2026. So, the numbers around it are: to its left is 2025, above it is a number from the previous layer. To find the exact neighbors, we need to understand that 2025 is at the corner of the 22nd layer. The numbers around 2025 are 1981 (above), 1980 (above-left), 2024 (left), 2026 (right), 2069 (below-right), 2068 (below), and 2067 (below-left). So, for 2026, the neighbors are: 2025 (left), 2027 (right), 1981 (above), 2069 (below), and the diagonals: 1980 (above-left), 1982 (above-right), 2068 (below-left), and 2070 (below-right).

## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 1981, 2069, 1980, 1982, 2068, 2070. Let's sum them:
- $2025 + 2027 = 4052$
- $4052 + 1981 = 6033$
- $6033 + 2069 = 8102$
- $8102 + 1980 = 10082$
- $10082 + 1982 = 12064$
- $12064 + 2068 = 14132$
- $14132 + 2070 = 16202$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16202}$
