## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 in the center and spirals outward. To understand the pattern, let's first identify the positions of numbers around 1. The number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We need to analyze how the numbers are distributed in the grid.


## Step 2: Identify the coordinates of the number 1 and its neighbors
Let's assign coordinates to the numbers, with 1 being at (0,0). Then, 2 is at (1,0), 3 is at (1,1), 4 is at (0,1), 5 is at (-1,1), 6 is at (-1,0), 7 is at (-1,-1), 8 is at (0,-1), and 9 is at (1,-1). This helps in visualizing the pattern.


## Step 3: Determine the layer of the spiral where 2026 is located
The spiral is made up of layers around the center. The first layer contains 1 number (1), the second layer contains 8 numbers (2-9), the third layer contains 16 numbers (10-25), and so on. The nth layer contains $8n$ numbers (for $n \geq 1$) and starts with the number $(2n-1)^2 + 1$ and ends with $(2n+1)^2$. We need to find the layer where 2026 is.


## Step 4: Calculate the layer for 2026
To find the layer for 2026, we first need to identify between which two square numbers 2026 lies. Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer because it follows 2025.


## Step 5: Identify the position of 2026 in the grid
2025 is at the corner of the 22nd layer (since $45^2 = 2025$), which means 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer. The 23rd layer starts at $(22, -22)$ if we consider the center as (0,0) and the spiral going outward. The numbers in the 23rd layer are distributed as follows: the first number (2026) is at $(22, -22)$, and the layer progresses counterclockwise.


## Step 6: Determine the coordinates of 2026
2026 is at $(22, -22)$.


## Step 7: Find the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers to its north, south, east, west, and the four diagonals. So, we need to calculate the numbers at $(22, -23)$, $(22, -21)$, $(23, -22)$, $(21, -22)$, $(23, -23)$, $(21, -23)$, $(23, -21)$, and $(21, -21)$.


## Step 8: Calculate the values of the neighbors
First, let's understand the pattern of numbers around the corners and edges. The number 2026 is the first in its layer. The neighbors are:
- North: $(22, -23)$, which is $2026 - 1 = 2025$ (since it's the last number of the previous layer).
- South: $(22, -21)$, which is $2026 + 1 = 2027$.
- East: $(23, -22)$, which is $2026 + (2*23 - 1) = 2026 + 45 = 2071$.
- West: $(21, -22)$, which is $2026 - (2*22 - 1) = 2026 - 43 = 1983$.
- Northeast: $(23, -23)$, which is $2026 + 45 - 1 = 2070$.
- Northwest: $(21, -23)$, which is $2026 - 43 - 1 = 1982$.
- Southeast: $(23, -21)$, which is $2026 + 45 + 1 = 2072$.
- Southwest: $(21, -21)$, which is $2026 - 43 + 1 = 1984$.


## Step 9: Sum the neighbors of 2026
Now, sum the neighbors: $2025 + 2027 + 2071 + 1983 + 2070 + 1982 + 2072 + 1984$.


## Step 10: Perform the summation
$2025 + 2027 = 4052$, $4052 + 2071 = 6123$, $6123 + 1983 = 8106$, $8106 + 2070 = 10176$, $10176 + 1982 = 12158$, $12158 + 2072 = 14230$, $14230 + 1984 = 16214$.


The final answer is: $\boxed{16214}$
