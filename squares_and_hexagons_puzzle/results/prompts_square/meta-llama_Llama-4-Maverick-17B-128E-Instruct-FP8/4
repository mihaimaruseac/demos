## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 at the center, and the numbers are arranged in a spiral manner. To understand the pattern, let's first identify how the numbers are distributed around the center. The sequence given is: ... 5 4 3 ..., ... 6 1 2 ..., ... 7 8 9 .... This indicates that the numbers are spiraling outward from the center.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral. The spiral pattern can be analyzed by considering the layers around the center. The first layer contains 1, the second layer contains numbers 2 to 9, the third layer contains numbers 10 to 25, and so on. Each layer is a square with a side length that increases by 2 as we move outward.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer in which 2026 is located
The $n^{th}$ layer contains $(2n-1)^2$ numbers, starting from $(2n-1)^2 - (2n-1) + 1 = (2n-2)^2 + 1$ to $(2n-1)^2$. To find the layer where 2026 is, we need to find $n$ such that $(2n-2)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n-1)^2$. Let's solve this inequality.

## Step 4: Solve for n
We start by testing values of $n$:
- For $n = 14$, $(2*14-1)^2 = 27^2 = 729$ and $(2*14-2)^2 = 26^2 = 676$. 2026 is greater than 729.
- For $n = 15$, $(2*15-1)^2 = 29^2 = 841$ and $(2*15-2)^2 = 28^2 = 784$. 2026 is greater than 841.
- Continuing this way, for $n = 32$, $(2*32-1)^2 = 63^2 = 3969$ and $(2*32-2)^2 = 62^2 = 3844$. Since $3844 < 2026 \leq 3969$, $n = 32$ is the layer where 2026 is located.

## Step 4: Identify the exact position of 2026 within its layer
The numbers in the $32^{nd}$ layer range from $62^2 + 1 = 3845$ to $63^2 = 3969$. Since $2026$ is less than $3845$, it's not in the $32^{nd}$ layer. Let's check the $n = 23$: $(2*23-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ and $(2*23-2)^2 = 44^2 = 1936$. $2026 = 2025 + 1$, so 2026 is the first number in the $23^{rd}$ layer.

## Step 5: Understand the structure of the layer
The $23^{rd}$ layer starts with 2026 on the right side of the layer (since $45^2 = 2025$ is the last number of the $22^{nd}$ layer, and 2026 is the first number of the $23^{rd}$ layer). The numbers in this layer are distributed as follows: the right side contains $2026$ to $2026 + 44 = 2070$, the bottom side contains $2071$ to $2071 + 44 = 2115$, the left side contains $2116$ to $2116 + 44 = 2160$, and the top side contains $2161$ to $2161 + 44 = 2025 + 45^2 = 2025 + 2025 = 4050 - 2025 = 2025$ (this is incorrect as it exceeds $45^2$; correctly, it goes from $2161$ to $2025 + 45 = 2070 + 45 - 1 = 2114 + 45 - 1 + 1 = 2160 + 45 - 1 = 2204$, but the correct count is simply the sequence continuing: $2161, 2162, ..., 2205$).

## Step 6: Correctly identify the neighbors of 2026
2026 is the first number on the right side of the $23^{rd}$ layer. Thus, its neighbors are: the number above it (which is in the $22^{nd}$ layer), the number to its right (2027), the number below it (2071), and the numbers diagonally adjacent to it. The number above 2026 is $2026 - 45 = 1981$ (since the difference between consecutive numbers on the same column in adjacent layers is $45 - 1 + 1 = 45$ for the first number on the right side, but we need to understand the pattern to correctly identify neighbors).

## Step 7: Calculate the neighbors
The neighbors of 2026 are:
- To the left: $2026 - 1 = 2025$ (in the $22^{nd}$ layer, on the top-right corner).
- To the right: $2027$.
- Above: $1981$ (since $2026$ is on the right edge, the number above it is $2026 - 45 = 1981$).
- Below: $2071$.
- Diagonally above-left: $1981 - 1 = 1980$.
- Diagonally above-right: $1981 + 1 = 1982$.
- Diagonally below-left: $2071 - 1 = 2070$.
- Diagonally below-right: $2071 + 1 = 2072$.

## Step 8: Sum the neighbors of 2026
Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 2071 + 1980 + 1982 + 2070 + 2072$.

## Step 9: Perform the summation
Sum = $2025 + 2027 = 4052$, $4052 + 1981 = 6033$, $6033 + 2071 = 8104$, $8104 + 1980 = 10084$, $10084 + 1982 = 12066$, $12066 + 2070 = 14136$, $14136 + 2072 = 16208$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16208}$
