## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 at the center, and the numbers are arranged in a spiral manner. To understand the pattern, let's first identify the positions of the numbers around 1. The number 1 is surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the first layer. We need to determine how the numbers are arranged and find a pattern.

## Step 2: Determine the layer where 2026 is located
To find the sum of the neighbors of 2026, we first need to locate 2026 in the spiral. The spiral is constructed such that the first layer around 1 contains the numbers 2 to 9 (8 numbers), the second layer contains numbers 10 to 25 (16 numbers), and so on. The nth layer contains $8n$ numbers. The total number of elements up to and including the nth layer can be calculated using the formula $1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)^2$. We need to find n such that $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$.

## Step 3: Calculate the layer for 2026
Let's solve the inequality $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$. First, we find the square root of 2026, which is approximately 45.01. This means $2n+1$ should be just above 45, so $2n+1 = 45$ or $n = 22$ because $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$. Thus, 2026 is in the 22nd layer (since $2025 = 45^2$ is the last number of the 22nd layer, 2026 is the first number of the 23rd layer, but for the purpose of understanding its position, we note it's the first number in the sequence that starts after $45^2$).

## Step 4: Identify the position of 2026 in the grid
Since $45^2 = 2025$, the number 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer. The 23rd layer starts after the number 2025. The numbers in the spiral are arranged such that the first number of a new layer is to the right of the last number of the previous layer. So, 2026 is to the right of 2025.

## Step 5: Understand the structure of the layer
The numbers in any layer are distributed across the four sides of the square (right, down, left, up). The first number of a layer is on the right side, and the last number is on the top side. For the 23rd layer, the first number is 2026.

## Step 6: Locate the neighbors of 2026
2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer. To find its neighbors, we need to understand its position relative to the grid. The number 2025 is at the bottom right corner of the 22nd layer. Thus, 2026 is to its right. The neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the four diagonals.

## Step 7: Calculate the neighbors of 2026
2026 is on the right edge of the 23rd layer. Its neighbors are:
- To the left: 2025
- To the right: 2027
- Above: 1982 (since the layer above it ends at 1981, and the number above 2026 is $2026 - 44 = 1982$)
- Below: 2070 (since the next layer's numbers continue from 2026, and the number below it is $2026 + 44 = 2070$)
- Diagonals: above-left (1939), above-right (1983), below-left (2025 - 44 = 1981), below-right (2071)

## Step 8: Sum the neighbors of 2026
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1982, 2070, 1939, 1983, 1981, and 2071. Let's sum them:
$2025 + 2027 + 1982 + 2070 + 1939 + 1983 + 1981 + 2071$

## Step 9: Perform the summation
$2025 + 2027 = 4052$
$4052 + 1982 = 6034$
$6034 + 2070 = 8104$
$8104 + 1939 = 10043$
$10043 + 1983 = 12026$
$12026 + 1981 = 14007$
$14007 + 2071 = 16078$

The final answer is: $\boxed{16078}$
