## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the spiral
The given spiral pattern starts with 1 at the center and spirals outward. To understand the pattern, let's first identify how the numbers are arranged. The sequence given is: ... 5 4 3 ..., ... 6 1 2 ..., ... 7 8 9 .... This indicates that the spiral moves clockwise.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the number 2026 in the spiral
To find the position of 2026, we need to understand how the spiral is constructed. The spiral starts with 1, then moves right (2), down (3), left (4), up (5), and so on, increasing the distance it travels in each direction as it spirals outward. The numbers are arranged in a square grid, with the center being 1.

## Step 3: Analyze the spiral pattern to identify the layer where 2026 is located
The spiral can be visualized as layers around the center. The first layer contains 1 (1 number), the second layer contains 3, 2, 5, 4 (4 numbers, but the layer is considered to start from 2 and end at 5, making it 4 numbers including the ones on the corners and the sides), and so on. The nth layer contains $8n - 4$ numbers if we consider the numbers on the corners and the sides, but more accurately, the number of elements in the nth layer can be derived from understanding that each layer adds a certain number of elements. The first layer has 1 element, the second layer has 8 elements (from 2 to 9), and so on.

## Step 4: Calculate the layer of 2026
Let's analyze the pattern of numbers in each layer:
- Layer 1: 1 number (1)
- Layer 2: 8 numbers (2-9)
- Layer 3: 16 numbers (10-25)
- ...
The number of elements up to and including the nth layer can be calculated by the formula $1 + 8 + 16 + ... + 8n = 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)^2$.
To find the layer where 2026 is, we need to find n such that $(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$ because 2026 is not necessarily at the start or end of a layer.

## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find n for 2026
Let's find n:
$(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n+1)^2$.
For $n = 22$, $(2*22-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$ and $(2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$. So, $2025 = 45^2$ is the last number of the 22nd layer (since the layer count starts at 0 for the center, but here we directly correlate it with the square root).
2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer.

## Step 6: Identify the neighbors of 2026
Since 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, it is on the right side of the spiral, directly to the right of 2025. The neighbors of 2026 will be the numbers directly above, below, to the left, to the right, and the four diagonals.

## Step 7: Calculate the numbers surrounding 2026
2026 is the first number of the 23rd layer. The numbers in the 23rd layer start from 2026. The last number of the 22nd layer is 2025. The layout around 2026 can be understood by knowing the numbers in the 22nd and 23rd layers.

## Step 8: Determine the exact neighbors
The number to the left of 2026 is 2025. To find the other neighbors, we need to understand the pattern:
- The number above 2026 is in the previous layer (22nd layer), and since 2026 is the first number in its layer, the number above it is $2026 - 45 = 1981$ (because the difference between the first number of a layer and the number directly above it is the size of the previous layer's side, which is $2n-1 = 45$ for $n=23$).
- The number below 2026 is $2026 + 1 = 2027$ (since it's the next number in the sequence).
- The number to the right of 2026 is $2026 + 1 = 2027$.
- The neighbors are: above (1981), above-left (1980), left (2025), below-left (2024), below (2027), below-right (2028), right (2027), and above-right (1982).

## Step 9: Correct the understanding of neighbors based on the spiral pattern
Let's correctly identify the neighbors:
- 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer.
- The number above it is 1981.
- The number to its left is 2025.
- The numbers below and to the right are in the same layer or the next number in sequence.
The correct neighbors are:
- Above: 1981
- Above-right: 1982
- Left: 2025
- Right: 2027
- Below-left: 2024
- Below: 2027
- Below-right: 2028
- Above-left: 1980

## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the neighbors
Sum = 1981 + 1982 + 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 1980.

## Step 11: Perform the sum
Sum = 1981 + 1980 + 1982 + 2025 + 2027 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028.
Sum = (1981 + 1980 + 1982) + (2025 + 2027 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028).
Sum = 5943 + 10131.
Sum = 16074.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16074}$
