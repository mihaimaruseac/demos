Let the number at the center of the grid be 1. The numbers are arranged in a spiral.
The neighbors of a number are the 8 numbers surrounding it.
We can consider the layers of the spiral. The layer 1 is just the number 1.
Layer 2 is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which has numbers from 2 to 9. The largest number is $2^2-1=3^2-1=9$.
Layer 3 is 10, 11, ..., 25. The largest number is $5^2-1=25$.
Layer $k$ is $2k-1$.
The numbers in layer $k$ are from $(2k-3)^2+1$ to $(2k-1)^2$.
We want to find the neighbors of 2026.
We can find the layer of 2026.
Since $44^2=1936$ and $45^2=2025$, the number 2026 is in the layer $2k-1=45$, so $k=23$.
The numbers in layer 23 are from $43^2+1=1849+1=1850$ to $45^2=2025$.
So 2026 is one step away from the center.
The layer of 2026 is $2025<2026<2025+4(45)=2025+180=2205$.
Since 2025 is in the layer $2k-1=45$, so $k=23$.
We have $45^2 = 2025$.
We have $2026 = 2025+1$, so 2026 is to the right of 2025.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
$2025-1 = 2024$
$2025-45 = 1980$
$2025-45-1 = 1979$
$2026+44 = 2070$
$2025+44 = 2069$
The numbers are arranged in a spiral.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025 (above)
$2026-1 = 2025$ is the right neighbor.
$2026-45-1=1980$
$2026-45=1981$
$1979$
$2025-45=1980$ is above 2026-1.
So the neighbors are $2025, 1981, 1980, 1982$.
$2026$ is near $2025=45^2$, so the neighbors are
$45^2-1=2024$
$2025-44 = 1981$
$1981$ is below 2026.
$2025-45 = 1980$
$2025-44 = 1981$
The neighbors of 2026 are: $2025, 2024, 2069, 2070, 1981, 1980, 1937, 1936$.
2026 is 1 unit from 2025. The neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2069, 2070, 1981, 1980, 1937, 1936.
2026 is close to 2025, the neighbors are 2024, 2069, 2070, 1981, 1980.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 1981, 1982, 1980, 2070, 2069, 2024.
2025, 2027, 2024
2026's neighbors are 2025, 1981, 1980, 1982, 2027.
The neighbors are $2025, 2024, 1980, 1981, 1982, 2070, 2069, 2027$.
Sum of neighbors is $2025+2024+1980+1981+1982+2070+2069+2027=16158$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16158}$
