Let's consider the spiral layout on a square grid. The center is 1. We can see that the numbers increase in a spiral pattern outwards from the center.
The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, ... are located at the corners of the spiral.
We can express the corner numbers as $1 + 2(k^2 - k)$ for $k \ge 1$.
Let $n = 2026$. We want to find the neighbors of 2026.
Since $n$ is close to the corner numbers, we can approximate the position of 2026 by finding the value of $k$ such that $1 + 2(k^2 - k) \approx 2026$.
$2026 - 1 = 2025$
$2(k^2 - k) \approx 2025$
$k^2 - k \approx 1012.5$
$k^2 - k - 1012.5 \approx 0$
We can estimate $k$ by $k \approx \sqrt{1012.5} \approx 31.8$. So we can try $k=32$.
If $k=32$, then $1 + 2(32^2 - 32) = 1 + 2(1024 - 32) = 1 + 2(992) = 1 + 1984 = 1985$.
The number 1985 is at the bottom right corner of the square with side length $2 \times 32 - 1 = 63$.
For $k=33$, $1 + 2(33^2 - 33) = 1 + 2(1089 - 33) = 1 + 2(1056) = 1 + 2112 = 2113$.
The number 2113 is at the bottom right corner of the square with side length $2 \times 33 - 1 = 65$.
Since 2026 is between 1985 and 2113, it is in the square with side length 65.
The position of 2026 is close to the right side of the square with side length 65.
Let's find the position of 2026 relative to the numbers 1985 and 2113.
2113 - 2026 = 87
2026 - 1985 = 41
So 2026 is 41 steps from 1985 towards 2113.
The number 2026 is at $32^2 - 32 + 41 + 1 = 1024 - 32 + 41 = 1033$.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2030, ...
Let's consider the neighbors. The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2020, 2022, 2024.
Let's find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2020, 2022, 2024, ...
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2028, 2029, 2030.
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2020 + 2021 + 2022 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 = 16102
Sum = (2025+2027+2020+2022) + (2028+2029+2030+2031) - 2031
Let's look at the pattern.
The sum of neighbors = 8n
The number 2026 is near the right edge.
The neighbors will be 2025, 2027, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2028, 2029, 2030.
Sum = 2025+2027+2020+2021+2022+2028+2029+2030 = 16102
Sum of neighbors is 8 * 2026 = 16208.
16208-6
The average of the neighbors is around the number itself.
Sum = 16102
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
