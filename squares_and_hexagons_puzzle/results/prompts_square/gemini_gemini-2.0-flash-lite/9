Let the number be denoted by $n$. We can see the pattern in the spiral.
The number 1 is at the center. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are the neighbors of 1.
The neighbors of 1 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The sum is 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44.

We can analyze the numbers in the spiral.
The first few layers are:
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Layer 3: 10, 11, ..., 25
The squares on each layer are:
Layer 1: $1 = 1^2$
Layer 2: $9 = 3^2$
Layer 3: $25 = 5^2$
Layer 4: $49 = 7^2$
...
In layer $k$, the largest number is $(2k-1)^2$.
We want to find the layer of 2026.
If $2k-1 = x$, then $x^2$ is the last number in the layer.
We want to find $x$ such that $x^2$ is close to 2026.
$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
So $2k-1 \approx 45$, which means $2k \approx 46$, so $k \approx 23$.
$45^2 = 2025$, so 2026 is at the upper right side.
Layer 23 has $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
Then the number 2026 is next to 2025.
The spiral goes counterclockwise.
2025 is at (22, -22) (or (45, -1) in the spiral).
2025 is at the bottom right.
2026 is to the right of 2025.
So the number 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
The largest number in layer 22 is $(2(22)-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2024, 2028, 2029.
The number to the right of 2025 is 2026.
2027 is on the top.
2024 is below.
The number of elements on layer $k$ is $8(k-1)+4$.
For the 23rd layer, we have $2025, 2026$.
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2024, 2028, 2029.
The sum of neighbors is 2025 + 2027 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 = 16148.

The numbers around 2026 are
2027
2006 2026 2028
2005 2025 2029
2004
Sum is 2027+2006+2028+2004+2029+2025+2005+2024 = 16148

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16148}$
