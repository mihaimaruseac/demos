Let the numbers be arranged in a square grid with the number 1 in the center. The numbers spiral outwards.
The number 1 is in position (0,0).
The number 2 is in position (1,0).
The number 3 is in position (1,1).
The number 4 is in position (0,1).
The number 5 is in position (-1,1).
The number 6 is in position (-1,0).
The number 7 is in position (-1,-1).
The number 8 is in position (0,-1).
The number 9 is in position (1,-1).
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let $n$ be the number we are interested in. The layers are formed in squares, with the number 1 being the center.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The numbers in layer $k$ are between $(2k-2)^2 + 1$ and $(2k-1)^2$.
We have $n=2026$. We need to determine which layer the number 2026 is in.
We want to find $k$ such that $(2k-2)^2+1 \leq 2026 \leq (2k-1)^2$.
We know that $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, so we can estimate that $2026$ is in layer 23.
We have $(2k-1)^2 = 2025 \implies 2k-1 = 45 \implies 2k = 46 \implies k = 23$.
Thus, $2026$ is in layer 23.
We have $(2(23)-2)^2 + 1 = 44^2 + 1 = 1937$.
We have $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
Since $1937 \leq 2026$, and $2026 > 2025$, the number 2026 is in the 23rd layer, and it is located on the right side.
We have $2026 = 1936 + 90$.
Let $s = 2k-1 = 45$. The number $n = 2026$ is in the 23rd layer.
The number 2025 is the largest number in the 23rd layer.
The neighbors are:
2025, 2024, 2023, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 2027.
The number of elements in each layer is $8(k-1)$.
The position of $n$ can be calculated as follows:
$n = (2k-1)^2$ is at the bottom right.
$n = (2k-1)^2 - x$ where $x = 0, 1, 2, ...$
We can calculate $2026 - 2025 = 1$.
The numbers around 2026 are 2025, 2024, 2023, 2027.
The numbers around 2026 are 2027, 1982, 1983, 1984, 2025, 2024, 2023, 1980.
So we have $2026-1 = 2025$ on the right. Then 2024, 2023.
$2026+1 = 2027$.
The neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1981.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2024, 2023, 1982, 1981, 1980.
The neighbours of 2026 are 2025, 2024, 2023, 2027, 1982, 1981, 1980, 1984.
2026 is at the right side. The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2024, 2023, 1982, 1981, 1980.
Sum = $2025+2024+2023+2027+1982+1981+1980+1984 = 16026$
$2025+2024+2023+2027+1982+1981+1980+1984 = 16026$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16028}$
