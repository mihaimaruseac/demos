Let's analyze the spiral pattern. The number 1 is in the center. The numbers spiral outwards.
The number 1 is in the center.
The number 2 is to the right of 1.
The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 form the first ring around 1.
The numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 form the second ring around 1.

The numbers on the diagonal from the center have the form
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, ...
These are the odd squares, i.e., $2n+1$, where $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...$
The values are $1$, $3^2-6$, $5^2-12$, $7^2-18$, $9^2-24$, ...
The numbers on the spiral diagonal have the form $4k^2 - 12k + 9$, $4k^2 - 10k + 7$, $4k^2 - 8k + 5$, $4k^2 - 6k + 3$.
The numbers on the spiral diagonal from the top right have the form $n^2$.

Let's find the approximate position of 2026. Since the spiral moves outwards, the value $n^2 \approx 2026$, so $n \approx \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
The nearest square is $45^2 = 2025$.
Since 2025 is a square number, it must be the number in the lower right corner of the grid.
2026 is to the right of 2025.
The number 2025 is located at coordinates (22, 22), so 2026 is at (23, 22).

The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2025, 2027, 2028, 1989, 1988, 1987, 1986.
The positions of neighbors:
2025 (22,22)
2027 (24, 22)
2024 (22, 21)
2028 (23, 23)
Neighbors are:
2027, 2028, 2025, 2024, 2000, 1989, 1988, 1987
2027, 2024, 2028, 2025, 2000, 1988, 1989, 1986
2025 is $45^2$.
2026 is at $2025 + 1$.
The numbers around 2025 are 1989, 1988, 1987, 2024, 2023, 2026, 2027, 2028
2026 is (23, 22)
Neighbors:
2025, 2027, 2028
2024, 1987, 1986, 1988, 1989
2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 1988, 1989, 1986, 1987
The neighbors of 2026 are 2027, 2028, 2025, 2024, 1989, 1988, 1987, 1986.
Sum = 2027 + 2028 + 2025 + 2024 + 1989 + 1988 + 1987 + 1986 = 16054

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16054}$
