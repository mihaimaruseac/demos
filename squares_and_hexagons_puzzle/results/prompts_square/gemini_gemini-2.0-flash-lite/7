Let the number $n$ be written in the spiral. The number $n$ is in the form of $n = (2k-1)^2$ for some integer $k$. The numbers on the spiral are laid out in a square grid.
The number 1 is in the center. The numbers spiral outward.
We want to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let's find the position of 2026.
We can estimate the square root of 2026 as $\sqrt{2025} = 45$.
The numbers on the spiral are in a square. The number at the top right of the square is $(2k-1)^2$, where $k$ is the layer.
We know that $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 is next to 2025.
The numbers near $45^2$ are in a square of size $2k-1 = 45$, so $k=23$.
The number 2025 is in the top right corner. The numbers around 2025 are:
... 2027, 2028, 2029 ...
... 2024, 2025, 2026 ...
...
We know that 2025 is at (22, 22) in the spiral.
2026 is at (22, 23).
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2025, 2027,
The numbers surrounding 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029
2008, 2007, 2006
The neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2007, 2008, 2006.
We are looking for the 8 neighbors.
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2025
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2007, 2008, 2029, 2028, 2006, x.
$2k-1=45$. Then $45^2=2025$. 2025 is in the corner.
We want the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2008, 2007, 2006.
The positions of the neighbors are:
2025
2027
2028
2029
2007
2008
2006
2046
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2046.
The sum of the 8 neighbors:
2025+2027+2028+2029+2006+2007+2008+2046
2025+2027+2029+2007+2028+2008+2006 = 16130

Sum of neighbors = 2025+2027+2007+2008+2029+2028+2006+2046 = 16176.

2026: (22, 23)
Neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2006, 2007, 2008.

Sum: 2025+2027+2028+2029+2006+2007+2008 = 14130
Sum = 2025+2027+2007+2008+2028+2006+2029+1990

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16176}$
