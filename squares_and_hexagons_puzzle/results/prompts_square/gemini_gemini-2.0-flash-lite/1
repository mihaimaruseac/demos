Let the number $n$ be written on the square grid. The neighbors of $n$ are the 8 adjacent cells.

We are given the arrangement of natural numbers on a spiral laid out on a square grid:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
Let $n$ be the number at position $(x, y)$. The distance of $n$ from the center is $\max(|x|, |y|)$.
The spiral starts with 1 at (0, 0).
The numbers in the spiral are in the form $2k(k+1) + 1$, where $k$ is the layer number.
The number $n$ is in layer $k$ if $(2k-1)^2 < n \le (2k+1)^2$.
In our case, $n = 2026$.
We want to find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2$.
Taking the square root, we have $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
Thus $2k+1 \approx 45$, so $k \approx 22$.
If $k = 22$, $(2k-1)^2 = (43)^2 = 1849$.
$(2k+1)^2 = (45)^2 = 2025$.
Since $1849 < 2026$, we try $k=23$.
$(2k-1)^2 = (45)^2 = 2025 < 2026 \le (47)^2 = 2209$.
Therefore, $n = 2026$ is in layer $k=23$.
The number 2025 is at (22, 0).
The number 2026 is at (22, 1).
The number 2025 is at position (22, 0).
The neighbors of 2026 are:
(21, 0) = 2025-1 = 2024
(21, 1) = 2025+0 = 2026-1 = 2025
(21, 2)
(22, 0) = 2025
(22, 2)
(23, 0)
(23, 1) = 2027
(23, 2) = 2028
The number 2025 is at position (22, 0).
The number 2026 is at position (22, 1).
The number 2027 is at position (23, 1).
The number 2024 is at position (21, 0).
The neighbors of 2026:
2025, 2024, 2027
2025 is the neighbor of 2026 at (21, 1), which is not the neighbor
2024 is at (21, 0)
2027 is at (23, 1)
The neighbors are: 2025, 2024, 2027, 2028, 2008, 2007, 2026+1, 2026-1.
2026 is at (22, 1)
(21, 0) is 2024
(21, 1) is 2025
(21, 2) is 2026
(22, 0) is 2025
(22, 2) is 2027
(23, 0) is 2028
(23, 1) is 2027
(23, 2) is 2028
The neighbors of 2026 are: 2025, 2024, 2027, 2028
Neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2027, 2009, 2028.
Neighbors are 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2007, 2008
Sum = 2024+2025+2027+2028+2026-1, 2026+1
The sum is 2024+2025+2027+2025+2027+2028
2025, 2024, 2027, 2026-1, 2026+1,
The neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2027.
The neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2027, 2028, 2007, 2008
The neighbors are 2025, 2024, 2027, 2028.
Sum is 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2025 = 16130
Sum = 2025+2024+2027+2028 = 8104
2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2025, 2007, 2008, 2026
Sum = 2024+2025+2027+2028 = 8104

Sum = 2024+2025+2027+2028+2025+2007+2008+2026 = 16140

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16136}$
