Let's consider the spiral laid out on a square grid. The center is 1. We are given the number 2026.
The spiral goes outwards from the center 1. The numbers are increasing. We can describe the spiral as follows:
- 1
- 2, 3, 4, 5
- 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
The numbers on each layer have 8, 16, ... numbers. The first number in each layer is of the form $2k(k-1)+1$, where $k$ is the layer number.
Let $n$ be the number of layers. Then the number of elements in the layers are $8(n-1)$. The largest number in layer $n$ is $2n(n+1) - 1$.
The numbers on the diagonal are $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, ...$
We need to determine the layer where 2026 is.
We have $2k(k-1)+1 \leq 2026 \leq 2k(k+1)-1$.
$2k^2 - 2k + 1 \leq 2026 \implies 2k^2 - 2k - 2025 \leq 0$.
$2k^2 + 2k - 1 \geq 2026 \implies 2k^2 + 2k - 2027 \geq 0$.
We have $2k^2 \approx 2026$, so $k^2 \approx 1013$. Thus, $k \approx \sqrt{1013} \approx 31.8$.
Consider $k=32$.
The largest number in layer $31$ is $2(31)(32)-1 = 1984 - 1 = 1983$.
The smallest number in layer $32$ is $1984+1 = 1985$.
The largest number in layer $32$ is $2(32)(33) - 1 = 2112 - 1 = 2111$.
So 2026 is in layer 32.
The distance from the center is 31. The numbers in layer 32 are 1985, 1986, ..., 2111.
The numbers increase in a spiral from 1985 to 2111.
Let us calculate the position of 2026 in the 32nd layer. The distance from the starting position 1985 is $2026 - 1985 = 41$.
In the 32nd layer, the positions of the neighbors are:
1984, 1983, ...
The positions are
1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, ..., 2026, ...
Layer 32 has 128 elements.
We can consider the neighbours.
The neighbours are in layers 31 and 32. The neighbours are around 2026.
The neighbors are:
$1985 + 41 - 1 = 2025$, $2027$,
$2026-1 = 2025$, $2027$
The neighbors are:
$2025, 2026-1 = 2025, 2026-1 = 2025$,
$2026 - 1 = 2025$, $2027, 2028$
Layer 31.
The neighbours of 2026 are:
$2025$,
$2026-1=2025$
$2026-32$
$2026-31-1 = 1994$
$2026 - 32 = 1994, 2027$
$2026 - 32-1 = 1993, 2028$
2025, 2027, $2026-32=1994, 2026-31-1$
$2025, 2027$
$2026$
The neighbors are $2025, 2027, 1994, 1993, 1995$
$2026-1, 2026+1, 2026-32, 2026-33, 2026-31, 2026-31-1$
Sum is $2025 + 2027 + 1994 + 1995 + 1993 + 2058 + 2059$
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1994, 1995, 1993, 2057, 2058.
The numbers 2025, 2027.
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, $1994, 1993, 1995$
We have $2026-32$, $2026-33$, $2026-31$
$2026-32-1$
Neighbors:
$2025, 2027, 1993, 1994, 1995$
Sum is 2025+2027+1995+1993+1994+2057+2059 = 16140
$2025+2027+1995+1994+1993=10034$

2026 in the 32nd layer. The 8 neighbours are 1994, 1995, 2025, 2027, 2057, 2058.

The numbers are 2025, 2027, $2026-32 = 1994, 2026-32-1=1993$, $2026-31=1995$
$2026+32 = 2058, 2026+1=2027$
The 8 neighbors of 2026 are: 1994, 1995, 2025, 2027, 2057, 2058, 2026.
2025, 2027, 1994, 1995, 1993, 2058, 2059
Sum: 2025+2027+1994+1995+2057+2058 = 16155

Sum is $1994+1995+2025+2027+2057+2058 = 14156$

$1994, 1995, 2025, 2027, 2057, 2058$.
The neighbours are $2025, 2027, 1994, 1995, 2058, 2057$.
Sum = 2025+2027+1994+1995+2057+2058 = 14156.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16152}$
