Let's carefully analyze the pattern to determine the neighbors of the number 2026 on this spiral.

**Understanding the Spiral Layout**

Given the illustration:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

we observe the spiral is laid out in a square grid with the number 1 at the center, expanding outward, and numbers increase along the spiral.

**Identify the General Pattern**

- The spiral starts at the center with 1.
- It moves to the right to 2, then up, left, down, and so on, expanding in a square pattern.
- The numbers form "layers" or "rings" around the center.

This pattern matches the typical "Ulam spiral" or similar square spirals built by extending layers around the center.

From the smaller examples, we see:

- Layer 0 (center): 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9
- Layer 2: numbers up to 25
- Layer 3: numbers up to 49
- Layer n: highest number in that layer is \((2n + 1)^2\).

**Find the Layer for 2026**

The maximum number in layer \( n \) is \((2n+1)^2\).

We want the layer \( n \) such that:

\[
(2n +1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Solve for \( n \):

\[
2n + 1 \geq \sqrt{2026}
\]

Calculate \(\sqrt{2026}\):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011...
\]

Thus:

\[
2n + 1 \geq 45.011...
\]
\[
2n \geq 44.011...
\]
\[
n \geq 22.005...
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, the smallest \( n \) satisfying this is:

\[
n = 23
\]

Check:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

which is greater than 2026, confirming 2026 is on the 23rd layer or ring.

---

### Step 1: Find the maximum number in the layer

- The 23rd layer has numbers from \((2 \times 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026\) to \(\boxed{47^2 = 2209}\).

Since \(47^2=2209\), the bottom right corner of the 23rd layer is 2209.

- The first number of this layer is:

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026
\]

which confirms that 2026 is **the first number in the 23rd layer**.

**Therefore:**

- 2026 is at the start of the 23rd layer.

---

### Step 2: Understand the position of 2026 in the layer

The total number of elements up to layer \( n-1 \):

\[
(2(n-1) + 1)^2
\]

For \( n = 23 \):

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

so:

- **Layer 23** includes numbers from \(2026\) to \(2209\).

Number of numbers in layer 23:

\[
2209 - 2026 + 1 = 184
\]

Since 2026 is the first in the layer (after 2025), its relative position within the layer:

\[
\text{Position} = 2026 - 2025 = 1
\]

This indicates 2026 is at some starting point on the layer.

---

### Step 3: Determine the shape and traversal of the layer

The layers are arranged in "rings":

- Each layer corresponds to a square perimeter of side length \( 2n + 1 \), which is 47 for layer 23.

- The total numbers up to previous layer:

\[
(2(n-1) + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

- The layer itself covers the perimeter of a square of side length \( 2n + 1 = 47 \).

- The perimeter of this layer:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times (2n + 1) - 4 = 4 \times 47 - 4 = 188
\]

- The starting position for the layer (number 2026) is at the "bottom right corner" of the square (this is typical for such spirals).

### Step 4: Coordinates of 2026

In the typical square spiral, the last completed layer (layer 22) ends at position (say, coordinate system centered at 1).

- The origin (the number 1) at (0,0).

- The 23rd layer forms a square with side length 47.

- The corners of the layer are at:

  - Bottom Right: \((n, -n)\). For \( n=23 \):

    \[
    (23, -23)
    \]

Note:

- The number 2026 is at the bottom right corner of the layer, which corresponds to the maximum of previous layer + 1.

- But as per previous calculations, 2026 is the start of the layer, so it's at the bottom right corner (since the layer begins there).

- Moving along the perimeter, the positions:

  1. **Start:** bottom-right corner \((n, -n)\): number 2026.
  2. Moving **left** along the bottom side.
  3. Then **up** along the left side.
  4. Then **right** along the top side.
  5. then **down** along the right side.

- The total numbers in this layer: 184.

- The first number (2026) is at corner \((n, -n)\).

- The positions proceed clockwise:

| Step | position | coordinate | number |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | bottom right corner | \((n, -n)\) | 2026 |
| 2 | moving left along bottom side | \((n - k, -n)\) for \(k=1,..,2n\) | 2027, 2028, ... |
| 3 | moving up | \((-n, -n + k)\) | ... |
| 4 | moving right | \((-n + k, n)\) | ... |
| 5 | moving down | \((n, n - k)\) | ... |

In this case, since 2026 is at the bottom right corner: \((n, -n)\).

---

### Step 5: Find the exact position of 2026 within the layer

Given that 2026 is the first number in the layer and corresponds to the bottom right corner.

The bottom side of the layer runs from \((n, -n)\) to \((-n, -n)\).

- The numbers along the bottom side:

\[
2026 \text{ (start)} \quad \text{at }(n, -n)
\]
and then counts as we move leftward.

- The number of positions along the bottom side:

\[
2n = 46
\]

- 2026 is at \((n, -n)\), the starting point.

Thus:

- The **location of 2026**: bottom right corner \((n, -n)\).

---

### Step 6: Coordinates of 2026 and its neighbors

Since 2026 at \((n, -n)\):

\[
n = 23
\]

coordinates:

\[
(23, -23)
\]

The neighbors are the eight surrounding cells:

\[
\text{Neighbors} = \{(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y) \mid \Delta x, \Delta y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\}
\]

excluding the cell itself.

Specifically:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& (22, -24) & \\
& (23, -24) & \\
& (24, -24) & \\
& (22, -23) & \\
& (24, -23) & \\
& (22, -22) & \\
& (23, -22) & \\
& (24, -22) &
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, for each neighbor, find the number assigned there.

---

### Step 7: Determine neighbor numbers

In the spiral, the assignment of numbers to coordinates depends on the position along the spiral.

The key is:

- The spiral progresses clockwise around the square:

  - Starting at \((n, -n)\) with number 2026.

  - Number incremented as we move along sides.

To find each neighbor's number:

- We need to determine the order of traversal.

**Layer details:**

- Side length: \(2n + 1 = 47\).

- The total perimeter points: 188 (excluding starting point).

- The starting point (2026) at \((n, -n)\) is at the bottom right corner (the extremity of the bottom side).

- Moving **leftward** along bottom:

  - Positions: \((n - k, -n)\), for \(k=0\) to \(2n\):

    - \(k=0\): \((n, -n)\), number = 2026.

    - \(k=1\): \((n-1, -n)\), number = 2027.

    - ...

    - \(k=2n=46\): \((-n, -n)\), number = 2026+46=2072.

Similarly, at each side, the numbers continue in sequence.

Therefore, the **numbering** along sides:

- Bottom side (from right to left):

  \[
  \text{Number at } (n - k, -n) = 2026 + k, \quad k=0 \text{ to } 46
  \]

- Left side (from bottom to top):

  \[
  \text{Number at } (-n, -n + k) = 2026 + (2n) + k, \quad k=1 \text{ to } 46
  \]

Similarly for top and right sides.

Total counts:

- Bottom side: 47 numbers, from 2026 to 2072.

- Left side: next 47 numbers, from 2073 to 2119.

- Top side: from 2120 to 2166.

- Right side: from 2167 to 2209.

---

### Step 8: Find the neighbor numbers

Using the route:

- \((n, -n)\): starting point with number 2026.

Neighbors:

1. \((22, -24)\):

   - Coordinates:

     - Since \(-24 = -n - 1\)

   - Along the bottom side:

     - For \(k=1\), position:

     \[
     (n - 1, -n) \quad \Rightarrow \text{number} = 2026 + 1 = 2027
     \]

   - For \((22, -24)\):

     - \(k=1\), so number = 2027.

2. \((23, -24)\):

   - Next position in bottom side: \(k=2\), number=2028.

3. \((24, -24)\):

   - \(k=3\), number = 2029.

4. \((22, -23)\):

   - Along the left side:

   - At \(( -n, -n + k )\):

   - For \((22,-23)\):

     Since \(-23 = -n + 1\), this is the first position after the corner.

   - The sequence along the left side starts at:

     \[
     2026 + 2n = 2026 + 46 = 2072
     \]

   - For each step upward:

     \[
     \text{number} = 2072 + k
     \]

   - \(k=1\) for \(( -n, -n + 1 )\):

     \[
     2072 + 1 = 2073
     \]

   - For \((22, -23)\):

     - Our \(k=1\):

     - So, number = 2073.

5. \((24, -23)\):

   - Next along the same side:

   - \(k=2\):

   \[
   2072 + 2 = 2074
   \]

6. \((22, -22)\):

   - Moving further up, now at top side.

   - Along the top:

     - Coordinates: \((-n + k, n)\)

     - starting at \((-n, n)\): number 2120

     - for positions:

       \[
       \text{Number} = 2120 + k
       \]

     - For our position \((22, -22)\):

       - \(\mathrm{coordinate}\) is \((-n + k, n)\)

       - \(-n + k = 22\), and \(n=23\), so:

         \[
         -23 + k = 22 \Rightarrow k=45
         \]

     - Thus, the number:

       \[
       2120 + 45 = 2165
       \]

7. \((23, -22)\):

   - Same side, \(k=46\):

     \[
     2120 + 46 = 2166
     \]

8. \((24, -22)\):

   - Next, moving to the right side, moving downward.

   - Coordinates: \((n, n - k)\), starting at \((n, n)\).

   - Numbering along right side begins at 2167, at \((n, n-1)\) with \(k=1\).

   - For \((24, -22)\):

     - Coordinate is \((n+1, n-2)\), but from the previous pattern, the neighbor at \((24,-22)\) is at:

     \[
     (n+1, n - 2)
     \]

   - But according to the perimeter sequence, moving clockwise, the last side is the downward side starting at \((n, n)\), moving down to \((n, -n)\).

   - Since \((24, -22)\):

     - \(\mathrm{dx} = 1\), \(\mathrm{dy} = 1\)

     - May need more details, but based on the pattern:

       - The neighboring numbers:

         - \((22, -24) \to 2027\)

         - \((23, -24) \to 2028\)

         - \((24, -24) \to 2029\)

         - \((22, -23) \to 2073\)

         - \((24, -23) \to 2074\)

         - \((22, -22) \to 2165\)

         - \((23, -22) \to 2166\)

We see a pattern of number assignment as the spiral progresses clockwise.

### **Summary of neighbor numbers:**

| Neighbor coordinate | Position type | Number assigned |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| \((22, -24)\)          | bottom side (left)  | 2027 |
| \((23, -24)\)          | bottom side (left)  | 2028 |
| \((24, -24)\)          | bottom side (left)  | 2029 |
| \((22, -23)\)          | left side (up)        | 2073 |
| \((24, -23)\)          | left side (up)        | 2074 |
| \((22, -22)\)          | top side (right)      | 2165 |
| \((23, -22)\)          | top side (right)      | 2166 |
| \((24, -22)\)          | right side (down)     | 2167 |

**Note:** \((24, -22)\) on the right side.

---

### **Final step: sum all neighbor values**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sum} &= 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2073 + 2074 + 2165 + 2166 + 2167 \\
&= (2027 + 2028 + 2029) + (2073 + 2074) + (2165 + 2166 + 2167) \\
&= (2027 + 2028 + 2029) + (2073 + 2074) + (2165 + 2166 + 2167) \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Calculate each group:

- First group:

\[
2027 + 2028 + 2029 = (2027 + 2028) + 2029 = (4055) + 2029 = 6084
\]

- Second group:

\[
2073 + 2074 = 4147
\]

- Third group:

\[
2165 + 2166 + 2167 = (2165 + 2166) + 2167 = 4331 + 2167 = 6498
\]

Now sum all:

\[
6084 + 4147 + 6498 = (6084 + 4147) + 6498 = 10231 + 6498 = 16729
\]

---

## **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{16729}
\]

**The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral layout is: \(\boxed{16729}\).**
