Let's carefully analyze the pattern and determine the neighbors of the number 2026 in the given spiral.

---

### Understanding the Spiral

The spiral is laid out on a square grid in the following pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

Interpreting this, the center of the spiral is **1** at position (row = 0, column = 0). Numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral. The pattern suggests the numbers are arranged in layers or "rings," each forming a square:

- The first layer (center): only **1** at position (0,0).
- The second layer surrounding 1: numbers 2 through 9.
- The third layer: numbers 10 through 25.
- The fourth layer: numbers 26 through 49.
- And so on...

The spiral expands in a square pattern, moving in steps: right, up, left, down, and so on, with each layer.

---

### Establishing the Pattern

**Key observations:**

- The maximum number in the *k*-th layer (starting from the center as layer 0) is \((2k + 1)^2\).

For example:
- Layer 0 (center): max number 1 = (2*0 + 1)^2 = 1.
- Layer 1: max number 9 = (2*1 + 1)^2 = 9.
- Layer 2: max number 25 = (2*2 + 1)^2 = 25.
- Layer 3: max number 49 = (2*3 + 1)^2 = 49.
- etc.

---

### Locating 2026

Find *k* such that:

\[
(2k + 1)^2 \ge 2026
\]

Solve for *k*:

\[
2k + 1 \ge \sqrt{2026}
\]

Calculate \(\sqrt{2026}\):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01
\]

So,

\[
2k + 1 \ge 45.01
\]

\[
2k \ge 44.01
\]

\[
k \ge 22.005
\]

Thus, **k = 23** is the smallest integer satisfying this, as:

\[
2*23 + 1 = 47
\]

and

\[
47^2 = 2209 \ge 2026
\]

Check the previous layer:

\[
(2*22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

which is less than 2026.

So, the number 2026 is **located in layer \(k = 23\)** because:

- The maximum number in layer 22: 2025.
- In layer 23: maximum number 2209, which includes 2026.

---

### Coordinates in the Spiral

In such a spiral, the number 1 is at the **center (0,0)**.

Layer \(k\) forms a square boundary with side length \(2k + 1\), and the maximum number at the bottom-right corner is at position \((k, k)\):

\[
\text{Number at } (k, k) = (2k+1)^2
\]

The numbers fill the square in the following sequence:

- Starting at \((k, -k + 1)\), move **up** to \((k, k)\)
- Then move **left** to \((-k, k)\)
- Then move **down** to \((-k, -k)\)
- Then move **right** back to \((k, -k)\)

Numbering proceeds along the perimeter.

---

### Finding 2026's Position in the Spiral

The maximum number in layer 23 is:

\[
\text{max} = (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

Layer 23's perimeter ranges from:

\[
\text{start} = (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 + 1 = 2026
\]

Wait, check this carefully:

- **Layer 22 maximum**: 2025
- Therefore, **layer 23**:

Number range: \(2026\) to \(2209\).

The **bottom-right corner** of layer 23:

\[
(23, 23)
\]

has number:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 2209
\]

And we find that the **layer 23** begins after 2025 (layer 22 maximum).

Since 2026 is **one more than 2025**, and the counting proceeds in the perimeter starting after 2025, 2026 must be at the **next position** following 2025 on the perimeter.

The perimeter of layer 23 has:

\[
\text{Perimeter length} = 8 \times 23 = 184
\]

But to find the exact position, observe the process:

- The layer 23 perimeter starts at the coordinate:

\[
(x, y) = (23, -22)
\]

which corresponds to number 2026.

---

### Shortcut (Known from standard spiral pattern):

In the standard "Ulam Spiral" with the center at 1:

- The number \(n\) lies on the layer \(k = \frac{\text{the smallest integer satisfying } (2k + 1)^2 \ge n}\), as above.
  
- For a given number \(n\) in layer \(k\), the position along the perimeter can be directly calculated, but this process becomes complex.

### Simplified Approach:

Since the **max number** in layer 23 is 2209, and the **bottom-right corner** at \((23, 23)\), corresponding to 2209.

Numbers decrease counter-clockwise along the perimeter:

- The bottom row (moving left): numbers from 2209 decreasing.

- The left column (up), then top row (left), then right column (down).

Because 2026 is close to 2025, which is at the corner at \((22, 22)\).

Given these insights, the position of 2026:

- 2025 is at \((22, 22)\), because:

\[
\text{max in layer 22} = 2025
\]

- The layer 23 extends from 2026 upward along the right edge, starting at \((23, -22)\):

If the bottom-right corner \((23, 23)\) is 2209, then:

- Moving **up** along the right edge from \((23, -22)\) to \((23, 23)\):

Number at \((23, -22)\):

Total numbers used in this layer up to this point:

- The previous layer: 2025.

- The perimeter length of layer 23:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 - (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 2209 - 2025 = 184
\]

The **start number** at the position \((23, -22)\):

\[
2026
\]

since it immediately follows 2025, and it's at the start of this side.

Thus:

- **2026** is at **coordinate \((23, -22)\)**.

### Finding Neighbor Coordinates

Neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

\[
(\text{row} \pm 1, \text{col}),\quad (\text{row}, \pm 1),\quad (\text{row} \pm 1, \pm 1)
\]

So, for the position \((23, -22)\), the neighbors are:

| Difference | Coordinate | Explanation             |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| (-1, -1)  | (22, -23)   | above-left             |
| (-1,  0)  | (22, -22)   | directly above         |
| (-1, +1)  | (22, -21)   | above-right          |
| ( 0, -1)  | (23, -23)   | left                   |
| ( 0, +1)  | (23, -21)   | right                  |
| (+1, -1)  | (24, -23)   | below-left           |
| (+1,  0)  | (24, -22)   | below                |
| (+1, +1)  | (24, -21)   | below-right        |

### Calculating the Neighboring Numbers

We need to find the **numbers** at these positions.

- We know \((23, -22)\) = 2026.

- For each neighbor coordinate, we need to determine what number is assigned there.

---

### How to find the number corresponding to a coordinate?

In the pattern:

- The **spiral._**

- The square layers are formed with corners at:

\[
( \pm k, \pm k )
\]

with numbers at these corners being:

\[
(2k + 1)^2
\]

- The perimeter numbers increase along sides starting from specific corners.

In particular:

- The top right corner: \((k, k)\), number = \((2k+1)^2\).

- The top left corner: \((-k, k)\), number = \((2k+1)^2 - (2k)\).

- The bottom left corner: \((-k, -k)\), number = \((2k+1)^2 - 3(2k)\)

- The bottom right corner: \((k, -k)\), number = \((2k+1)^2 - 4(2k)\)

But because the number assignment proceeds along the edges in a specific manner, and with the previous calculations, for positions along the perimeter:

- Starting from the **bottom-right corner** with number \((2k+1)^2\), moving **up** along the right edge:

\[
\text{coordinate }(k, -k + t) \text{ assigned: } (2k+1)^2 - t
\]

for \(t = 0, 1, ..., 2k\).

Similarly, for the other sides:

- **Right edge** (\(x=k\), \(y\) varies from \(-k\) to \(k\)):

\[
\text{Number} = (2k+1)^2 - (y + k)
\]

- **Top edge**:

\[
x \text{ from } k \text{ to } -k,\ y = k:

\[
\text{Number} = (2k+1)^2 - (2k + (k - x))
\]

Similarly for other edges.

But, to be precise, since this is complex, **we'll use these known formulas:**  

For the coordinate \((x, y)\):

- Derive \(k = \max(|x|, |y|)\)

- Determine which side of the square boundary the coordinate is on

- Use the known patterns for the number at each coordinate

---

### Calculate \(k\) for each neighbor:

Given \(k=23\), the main coordinate is \((23, -22)\).

Neighbors:

1. \(\mathbf{(22, -23)}\):

   \[
   |22|=22,\quad |-23|=23 \Rightarrow k=23
   \]

2. \(\mathbf{(22, -22)}\):

   \[
   |22|=22,\quad |-22|=22 \Rightarrow k=22
   \]

3. \(\mathbf{(22, -21)}\):

   \[
   22,\ 21\Rightarrow k=22
   \]

4. \(\mathbf{(23, -23)}\):

   \[
   23, 23 \Rightarrow k=23
   \]

5. \(\mathbf{(23, -21)}\):

   \[
   23, 21 \Rightarrow k=23
   \]

6. \(\mathbf{(24, -23)}\):

   \[
   24, 23 \Rightarrow k=24
   \]

7. \(\mathbf{(24, -22)}\):

   \[
   24, 22 \Rightarrow k=24
   \]

8. \(\mathbf{(24, -21)}\):

   \[
   24, 21 \Rightarrow k=24
   \]

---

### Find neighbor values:

**1. (22, -23), \(k=23\):**

- Left side of square:

\[
x=22, y=-23 \Rightarrow |x|=22, |y|=23 \Rightarrow k=23
\]

- At \((k, y)\) for the right edge:

\[
x=23, y=-23\ \text{(bottom corner)} \Rightarrow \text{number} = (2k+1)^2 - (k - y) = 47^2 - (23 - (-23)) = 2209 - (23+23)= 2209 - 46=2163
\]

But this looks inconsistent; perhaps better to use coordinate-based formulas:

Alternatively:

- For \((x, y)\), when \(|x|=k\):

Number:

\[
(2k+1)^2 - (k - y)
\]

Thus,

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 - (23 -(-23)) = 2209 - 46 = 2163
\]

**Neighbor 1: \( (22, -23) \) = 2163**

---

**2. (22, -22), \(k=22\):**

Similarly,

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 - (22 - (-22)) = 45^2 - 44 = 2025 - 44= 1981
\]

**Neighbor 2: \( (22, -22) \) = 1981**

---

**3. (22, -21), \(k=22\):**

\[
45^2 - (22 -(-21))= 2025 -43=1982
\]

**Neighbor 3: \( (22, -21) \) = 1982**

---

**4. (23, -23), \(k=23\):**

- Corner:

Number at \((k, -k)\):

\[
(2k+1)^2 - 4k = 2209 - 92 = 2117
\]

So:

**Neighbor 4: \((23, -23)\) = 2117**

---

**5. (23, -21), \(k=23\):**

Since \(x=23\), \(y=-21\):

\[
(2k+1)^2 - (k - y) = 2209 - (23 - (-21)) = 2209 - 44 = 2165
\]

**Neighbor 5: \((23, -21)\) = 2165**

---

**6. (24, -23), \(k=24\):**

Similarly,

\[
(2 \times 24 + 1)^2 - (k - y) = 49^2 - (24 - (-23))= 2401 - 47= 2354
\]

**Neighbor 6: \((24, -23)\) = 2354**

---

**7. (24, -22), \(k=24\):**

\[
49^2 - (24 - (-22))= 2401 - 46= 2355
\]

**Neighbor 7: \((24, -22)\) = 2355**

---

**8. (24, -21), \(k=24\):**

\[
49^2 - (24 - (-21))= 2401 - 45= 2356
\]

**Neighbor 8: \((24, -21)\) = 2356**

---

### **Summing It All Up:**

Neighbors' values:

| Coordinates   | Values | Sum contributions                |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| (22, -23)     | 2163     |                                  |
| (22, -22)     | 1981     |                                  |
| (22, -21)     | 1982     |                                  |
| (23, -23)     | 2117     |                                  |
| (23, -21)     | 2165     |                                  |
| (24, -23)     | 2354     |                                  |
| (24, -22)     | 2355     |                                  |
| (24, -21)     | 2356     |                                  |

Now, **calculate the total sum:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
&2163 + 1981 + 1982 + 2117 + 2165 + 2354 + 2355 + 2356 \\
= & (2163 + 1981) + (1982 + 2117) + (2165 + 2354) + (2355 + 2356) \\
= & 4144 + 4099 + 4519 + 4711 \\
= & (4144 + 4099) + (4519 + 4711) \\
= & 8243 + 9230 \\
= & \boxed{17,\473}
\end{aligned}
\]

---

## Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{\17473}
\]

**The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is \(\boxed{17473}\).**
