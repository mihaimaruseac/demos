Let's carefully analyze the problem:

We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a square grid, similar to a "spiral of numbers" pattern:

For example, the given snippet:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

This pattern corresponds to a well-known "spiral of numbers," where 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward in layers.

---

### Understanding the Spiral Pattern 

The pattern described is special: it resembles the *Ulam Spiral* or a similar spiral, but the key is to understand the placement of the number 1 and the surrounding numbers.

Given the pattern's partial view, the spiral is laid out as:

```
    ... 5 4 3 ...
    ... 6 1 2 ...
    ... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we notice:

- The number 1 is at position (row=0, column=0).
- The numbers increase as we move outward in a spiral.

**Observation:**

1. The number 1 is at the center, at coordinate (0,0).
2. Reading the grid, the first ring around 1 is:

```
  (−1, 0): 6
  (0, 1): 2
  (1, 0): 7
  (0, -1): 5
```

However, from the snippet, 6 is just above 1, with 2 to the right, 5 to the left, and 7 below, matching a standard outward spiral.

---

### Standard Spiral Layout:
Numbering in an outward square spiral:

- The center is 1 at (0,0).
- The next layer (layer 1) surrounds it with 8 numbers: 2-9.
- At each subsequent layer \( n \), the layer contains numbers from \((2n-1)^2 + 1\) up to \((2n+1)^2\).

**For example:**

- Layer 0: just 1 at (0,0)
- Layer 1: numbers 2-9, forming a square of size 3 x 3.
- Layer 2: numbers 10-25, a 5 x 5 square, and so on.

---

### Coordinates of a Number in the Spiral:

A known approach to find the position of a number in such a spiral:

1. Find the **layer** \( n \):
   
   \[
   n = \left\lceil \frac{\sqrt{k}}{2} \right\rceil
   \]
   
   This is because each layer corresponds to a square of size \( (2n+1) \times (2n+1) \).

2. The maximum number in layer \( n \):
   
   \[
   (2n +1)^2
   \]
   
3. The **layer number** \( n \) satisfies:
   
   \[
   (2n - 1)^2 < k \leq (2n + 1)^2
   \]

Once \( n \) is known, the side length:

\[
s = 2n + 1
\]

Number of elements in previous layers:

\[
(\text{Total numbers before layer } n ) = (s - 2)^2
\]

which equals the largest number in previous outer layer.

---

### Locating 2026:

Calculate \( n \):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.011
\]

\[
n = \left\lceil \frac{45.011}{2} \right\rceil = \lceil 22.5055 \rceil = 23
\]

Check the maximum number in layer 23:

\[
s = 2 \times 23 + 1 = 47
\]
\[
(2n+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

Since \( 2209 \geq 2026 \), number 2026 lies in layer 23.

Number of elements in previous layer:

\[
(2(n-1)+1)^2 = (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

positions in previous layers: 2025.

Within layer 23, the numbers go from 2026 to 2209.

To find the position of 2026 within the layer:

\[
\text{Offset from previous layer} = 2026 - 2025 = 1
\]

---

### Coordinates of 2026:

In the square of size 47:
- The layer's bottom-right corner (maximum number 2209) has coordinates \((n, -n+1)\).

In the spiral, the coordinates of the corners of layer \( n \):

- Right side: from bottom to top
- Top side
- Left side
- Bottom side

Following the standard pattern:

- Starting point for layer \( n \):
  
  The maximum number in layer \( n \) is at coordinate \((n, -n+1)\), which corresponds to the bottom right corner.

Number positions:

- The numbers in layer \( n \) are arranged along the four sides:

1. **Bottom side**: from \((n, -n+1)\) leftward to \((-n, -n+1)\)
2. **Left side**: from \((-n, -n+1)\ upward to \((-n, n)\)
3. **Top side**: from \((-n, n)\) rightward to \((n, n)\)
4. **Right side**: from \((n, n)\) downward to \((n, -n+1)\)

The total numbers in layer \( n \):

\[
\text{side length} = s = 2n + 1
\]
\[
\text{Numbers in layer} = s^2 - (s-2)^2 = 8n
\]

Sequence of counts per side:

- Bottom side: \( s - 1 \) numbers
- Left side: \( s - 1 \)
- Top side: \( s - 1 \)
- Right side: \( s - 1 \)

Total: \( 4(s-1) = 8 n \)

Given that, and that the maximum number \( 2209 \) lies at the bottom right corner:

- The last number in layer \( n \) (2209) is at \((n, -n+1)\).

Numbering backwards:

- The bottom side counts from the maximum number down.

Calculating the position:

Offset of 2026 from the maximum in the layer: 

\[
\text{offset} = 2209 - 2026 = 183
\]

Since the maximum (2209) is at \((n, -n+1)\), then:

- Moving **back along the perimeter**:

1. **Bottom side** (from bottom right to bottom left):

   Coordinates decrease in columns from \((n, -n+1)\) leftward.

2. Count of positions on bottom side:

\[
s - 1 = 46
\]

The last number, 2209, is at \((n, -n+1)\).

Number 2209: offset 0.

Number 2208: offset 1 (one step left).

Number 2207: offset 2, etc.

So for numbers less than 2209, the offset increases:

\[
\text{offset} = 2209 - \text{number}
\]

- For 2026:

\[
\text{offset} = 183
\]

Since the bottom side has 46 numbers, and the perimeter counting, the sequence is:

- From \(0\) to \(45\): bottom side
- From \(45\) to \(89\): left side
- and so on.

But since 183 > 45, it extends beyond bottom side; then, moving to the left side.

The total perimeter:

- The total steps to reach from maximum to 2026:

Calculate:

Number of steps along the bottom side:

\[
0 \leq \text{offset} \leq 45
\]
Number of steps along bottom:

- Since 183 > 45, it passes beyond bottom side.

Remaining offset:

\[
183 - 45 = 138
\]

Now, move to the **left side**:

- The left side runs from \((-n, -n+1)\) upward to \((-n, n)\). Its length: \( s - 1 = 46 \).

- The offsets for left side:

\[
0 \leq \text{offset} \leq 45
\]

But 138 > 45, so it crosses into the top side.

Now, sum of bottom and left:

\[
45 + 45 = 90
\]

Remaining offset:

\[
138 - 45 - 45 = 48
\]

Next side: top side, from \((-n, n)\) to \((n, n)\). Length 46.

Remaining offset: 48 > 45, so it proceeds into the **right side**.

Sum of three sides:

\[
45 + 45 + 45= 135
\]

Remaining offset:

\[
138 - 45 - 45 - 45= 3
\]

Finally, the **right side**, from \((n, n)\) down to \((n, -n+1)\):

- Length: \( s - 1 = 46 \).

Since the offset is 3, the position along the right side:

- Starting at \((n, n)\), moving downward.

- Coordinate:

\[
x = n
\]
\[
y = n - \text{offset}
\]

Because moving downward:

\[
y = n - \text{offset}
\]

Thus:

\[
x = n = 23
\]
\[
y = n - 3 = 23 - 3 = 20
\]

---

### Final Coordinates of 2026:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Row } y=20, \quad \text{Column } x=23
}
\]

*(Note: Since the grid's orientation is symmetric, and the description uses rows and columns, assuming row \( y \), column \( x \).)*

---

### Finding the 8 neighbors:

Neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

\[
(x-1,y-1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y-1)
\]
\[
(x-1,y), (x+1,y)
\]
\[
(x-1,y+1), (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1)
\]

which correspond to the positions:

\[
(22,19), (23,19), (24,19)
\]
\[
(22,20), (24,20)
\]
\[
(22,21), (23,21), (24,21)
\]

---

### **Mapping coordinates back to numbers:**

We have:

\[
x = 23, \quad y=20
\]

From earlier, the spiral surface:

- The origin (0,0) has number 1.
- The number at coordinate \((x,y)\):

**General formula:**

- For layer \( n \), with maximum number \( (2n+1)^2 \), the coordinate \((x,y)\) is:

\[
x, y \in [-n, n]
\]

Number at \((x, y)\):

1. Start at maximum corner at \((n, -n+1)\), which has number \( (2n+1)^2 \).

2. Moving counterclockwise along the perimeter, the number increases or decreases depending on position.

Alternatively, **since the pattern is symmetric**, define:

\[
k = n
\]
\[
\text{max} = (2k+1)^2
\]

and the position \((x,y)\):

- For \( y = k \):

\[
\text{Number} = \text{max} - (k - x)
\]

- For \( x = -k \):

\[
\text{Number} = \text{max} - (2k) - (k - y)
\]

- For \( y = -k \):

\[
\text{Number} = \text{max} - 4k - (x + k)
\]

- For \( x = k \):

\[
\text{Number} = \text{max} - 6k - (y + k)
\]

But these formulas depend on the side.

---

### **Alternative approach:**

Given the coordinate \((x,y)\):

The maximum layer \( n = 23 \).

Calculate the Manhattan distance from the origin:

\[
d = \max(|x|, |y|)
\]

but from previous calculations, the coordinate:

\[
x=23, y=20
\]

\[
|x|=23, \quad |y|=20
\]

so \( d=23 \), consistent with \( n=23 \).

Number of elements before this layer:

\[
(n-1)^2 \times 8 = 2025
\]

The minimal number in layer \( n \):

\[
(2(n-1)+1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026
\]

which matches our earlier calculations.

Number at coordinate \((x,y)\):

- The positions along the perimeter are mapped as:

Number:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n - 1)^2 + \text{offset along perimeter}
\]

Calculate perimeter offset:

- For each side:

Left side \( y = n \), \( x \) varies from \(-n \) to \( n \):

Number at \((x, n)\):

\[
(2n-1)^2 + (n - y) \quad \text{for } y = n
\]

Similarly for other sides.

Specifically, given the coordinate:

\[
x=23, y=20
\]
\[
n=23
\]
\[
\text{Max} = 47^2 = 2209
\]

Side length:

\[
s= 2n+1=47
\]

Position:

Since \(|x| < n\) or \(|y|< n\), the point is somewhere along a side.

Check:

\[
x=23 \leq n=23
\]
\[
y=20 \leq n=23
\]

- \(x= n \), \( y < n \), so it's on the right side.

Right side:

From \((n, n)\) down to \((n, -n+1)\):

Number at \((n, y)\):

\[
\text{Number} = (2n-1)^2 + (n - y)
\]

Compute:

\[
(2 \times 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2=2025
\]
\[
\text{Number} = 2025 + (23 - 20) = 2025 + 3= 2028
\]

Similarly, check for neighbors:

Positions:

- \((x-1,y-1) = (22,19)\):

Since \(x=22 < n=23\), and \(y=19<23\):

- It is on the **"South-East"** corner? No; it's somewhere inside.

But to determine the correct position, more straightforwardly:

- For each neighbor, determine the coordinate and corresponding number.

---

### Repeating the process to find neighbor values:

**1. Neighbor at (22,19):**

Because:

- \(|x|=22\), \(|y|=19\),
- \(\max=23\),
- with \( x< n \), \( y < n \), so both less than \( n \).

In the pattern, the following applies:

- For points where \(|x|< n\), \(|y|< n\), but not at the corner, they are inside the designated boundary, and their number can be computed similarly.

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n-1)^2 + \text{perimeter offset}
\]

Calculate the offsets for each neighbor:

---

### Coordinates and their corresponding numbers:

For clarity, define a function:

\[
\text{Number}(x,y) = (2n - 1)^2 + \text{perimeter position}
\]

with \( n=23 \), \( (2n-1)^2 = 45^2=2025 \).

Perimeters:

- The square perimeter is divided equally along four sides:

Side length: \( s-1=46 \).

Standard positions:

- Top side: \( y= n \), \( x \) varies from \(-n\) to \( n \). Number at \((x, n)\):

\[
\text{Number} = (2n-1)^2 + (n - y) = 2025 + (n - y)
\]
but if \( y= n \), then:

\[
\text{Number} = 2025 + (n - n) = 2025
\]

which is the maximum corner (bottom right).

- For other slopes and positions, similar calculations are made.

Now, for each neighbor:

---

### Neighbor coordinates and their numbers:

| Neighbor | Coordinates | Calculation | Resulting number |
|------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **(22,19)** | \(x=22, y=19\) | \( x< n, y< n \) | \(2025 + (n - y) + (n - x)\) or similar? | Let's reconsider. |
| **(23,19)** | (x=n, y=19) | So, at \( x=n \), \( y< n \). | \( 2025 + (n - y) \) | \( 2025 + (23 - 19) = 2025 +4=2029 \) |
| **(24,19)** | \( x=24 \), \( y=19 \) | \( x > n \), so on the right side. | \( 2025 + (x - n) \) | \( 2025 + (24-23)=2026 \) |
| **(22,20)** | \( x=22 \), \( y=20 \) | inside the square, \(|x|<n, |y|<n\) | \(\dots\) |

Given the previous approach might be complicated, **a better way** is to **simulate the position** of these neighbors directly, based on their relative positions, knowing that:

- The numbers increase outward in the spiral.

Alternatively, considering the pattern:

- At \((n, y)\) with \( y \leq n \), the number can be computed as:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n -1)^2 + (n - y)
\]

- Likewise, at \((x, n)\), points along the top row:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n - 1)^2 + (x + n)
\]

- Along the left side:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n - 1)^2 + 2n + (y + n)
\]

- Along the bottom:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n - 1)^2 + 4n + (x + n)
\]

Using these, compute each neighbor:

---

### Let's compute each neighbor:

Recall:

\[
(2n - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]
\[
n=23
\]

---

**1. (22,19):**

- \(x=22\), \( y=19 \)

Since:

\[
|x|=22 < 23, \quad |y|=19 < 23
\]

and both are less than \( n \), the position is inside the square, not on the border.

Approximating:

- Since \( x< n \), and \( y< n \), it's in the bottom side or interior.

But considering the pattern:

probably is better to use the general position formula:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n-1)^2 + \text{perimeter offset}
\]

or more precisely, if \( y< n \) and \( x< n \), the number is:

\[
\text{Number} = (2n -1)^2 + (n - y) + (n - x)
\]

Calculate:

\[
2025 + (23 - 19) + (23 - 22) = 2025 + 4 + 1 = 2030
\]

---

**2. (23,19):**

\[
x = n = 23, y=19
\]

Number:

\[
(2n-1)^2 + (n - y) = 2025 + 4=2029
\]

**3. (24,19):**

\[
x=24 > n
\]

On the right side:

\[
\text{Number}= (2n -1)^2 + (x - n) = 2025 + 1=2026
\]

**4. (22,20):**

\[
x=22, y=20
\]

Both less than \( n \):

\[
2025 + (23 - 20) + (23 - 22) = 2025 + 3 + 1=2029
\]

**5. (24,20):**

\[
x=24, y=20
\]

Right side:

\[
2025 + (24 - 23) = 2026
\]

---

**6. (22,21):**

\[
2025 + (23 - 21) + (23 - 22)= 2025 + 2 +1=2028
\]

**7. (23,21):**

\[
2025 + (23 - 21)=2025+2=2027
\]

**8. (24,21):**

\[
2025 + (24 - 23) + (21-20)=2025 + 1 + 1=2027
\]

---

### **Summary of neighbors' values:**

| Neighbor | Coordinates | Number |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| (22,19) | | **2030** |
| (23,19) | | **2029** |
| (24,19) | | **2026** |
| (22,20) | | **2029** |
| (24,20) | | **2026** |
| (22,21) | | **2028** |
| (23,21) | | **2027** |
| (24,21) | | **2027** |

---

### **Compute the sum:**

\[
2030 + 2029 + 2026 + 2029 + 2026 + 2028 + 2027 + 2027
\]

Sum step-by-step:

- \(2030 + 2029 = 4059\)
- \(4059 + 2026 = 6085\)
- \(6085 + 2029 = 8114\)
- \(8114 + 2026 = 10140\)
- \(10140 + 2028= 12168\)
- \(12168 + 2027= 14195\)
- \(14195 + 2027= 16222\)

---

## **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{16222}
\]

**The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is \(\boxed{16222}\).**
