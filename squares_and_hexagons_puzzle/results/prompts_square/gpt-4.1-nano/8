Let's analyze the pattern and the layout of the spiral to determine the neighbors of 2026.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Spiral Pattern

The given example:

\[
\begin{matrix}
  & 5 & 4 & 3 \\
  & 6 & 1 & 2 \\
  & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{matrix}
\]

This is a **spiral pattern** that:

- Starts at the center with 1.
- Moves outward in a spiral pattern, presumably counterclockwise (or clockwise, but consistent).

### Step 2: Determine the Spiral Type

The pattern resembles the **Ulam spiral** or similar number spirals, where integers are written along a path outward from the center.

The pattern shows:

- 1 at the center,
- 2 to the right of 1,
- then 3 above 2,
- 4 to the left of 3,
- 5 above 4,
- 6 below 5,
- and so on, in a spiral.

But to generalize, let's verify the layout more systematically: 

- For a square spiral starting at 1, the numbers are laid out so that the grid layers are concentric squares.

---

### Step 3: Recognize the spiral as a standard "Ulam-type" or "square spiral"

**Standard properties of such a spiral:**

- The numbers are arranged on layers (or "rings") around the center.
- Each layer \(k\) (starting from 0 at the center):
  - Has size \((2k + 1) \times (2k + 1)\),
  - Contains the square numbers \((2k+1)^2\) at the corners/edges.

---

### Step 4: Find the layer where 2026 resides

- Find **k** such that:

\[
(2k + 1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Calculate:

\[
(2k + 1)^2 \ge 2026
\]

Try \(k=22\):

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

which is **less than** 2026, so:

\[
2025 < 2026
\]

Try \(k=23\):

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

which **exceeds** 2026. So, 2026 is in the layer \(k=23\):

- The layer includes all numbers from \(2025 + 1\) to \(47^2 = 2209\).

---

### Step 5: Find position of 2026 in layer \(k=23\)

Layer \(k=23\):

- The maximum number in this layer is \(47^2=2209\).
- The previous layer ends at \(45^2=2025\).

Now, 2026 is just after 2025, so:

- The offset into this layer is:

\[
2026 - 2025 = 1
\]

- The layer has **perimeter length**:

Number of elements on the perimeter of the layer:

\[
(2k + 1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = (47^2) - (45^2) = 2209 - 2025 = 184
\]

which makes sense, but the key is the position of 2026 within the perimeter.

---

### Step 6: Coordinates and neighbors

In such square spiral layers:

- The corners of layer \(k\) are at positions:

\[
( \pm k, \pm k)
\]

- The "starting point" of the layer (say, the bottom right corner) is at coordinate:

\[
(k, -k + 1)
\]

In this spiral, generally, the numbers increase as you move around the perimeter:

- Starting at the bottom right corner (corner \(C_0\)), with value \((2k + 1)^2\),
- then moving counterclockwise around the perimeter.

Thus, for layer \(k=23\):

- The corners:

\[
\text{bottom-right corner: } (k, -k), \quad \text{value } (2k+1)^2 = 2209
\]

- The side length:

\[
2k + 1 = 47
\]

- The bottom side goes from \((k, -k)\) to \((-k, -k)\),
- The left side from \((-k, -k)\) to \((-k, k)\),
- and so on.

Number positions:

- Starting from bottom-right corner (value \(2209\) at \((k, -k)\)),
- moving left along the bottom side for \(2k\) steps,
- then up the left side, and so forth.

Number of steps per side:

\[
2k
\]

Total perimeter:

\[
8k
\]

Our target:

- 2025 is at the bottom right corner:

\[
(23, -23) \rightarrow 2025
\]

- Next number, 2026, will be the next position moving **counterclockwise**:

Moving counterclockwise:

- From bottom right corner \((23, -23)\), moving **left** along the bottom side:

Number of steps from 2025:

\[
2026 - 2025 = 1 \Rightarrow \text{it's the first move} along the bottom side.

\[
\text{Position of 2026}: (23, -23) \text{ shifted left by 1}
\]

Hence:

\[
(x, y) = \left(23 - (2026 - 2025), -23 \right) = (22, -23)
\]

---

### Step 7: Find the neighbors' coordinates

Neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

- Up: \((22, -22)\)
- Down: \((22, -24)\)
- Left: \((21, -23)\)
- Right: \((23, -23)\) (the current position)
- Diagonals:

  - Up-left: \((21, -22)\)
  - Up-right: \((23, -22)\)
  - Down-left: \((21, -24)\)
  - Down-right: \((23, -24)\)
  
Note that the cell to the right \((23, -23)\) is our number 2026 (we exclude it).

---

### Step 8: Find the numbers at neighboring positions

We can determine the number at a coordinate \((x,y)\):

\[
\text{Number} = \text{Total numbers before layer }k + \text{offset along layer}
\]

But it's easier to find the number directly from the position's pattern:

- From the layer description:

  - The bottom right corner number is \((2k + 1)^2\).

- The numbering proceeds counterclockwise:

  1. from bottom-right corner going **left** along bottom side from \((k, -k)\) to \((-k, -k)\),
  2. then **up** the left side,
  3. then **right** along top side,
  4. then **down** the right side to complete the layer.

---

### Step 9: Determine the number at each neighbor

Let's define:

- The layer \(k=23\) with side length \(47\).

The starting point at bottom right corner: value = 2209 at \((23, -23)\).

Numbering around the perimeter:

- Bottom side (from \((23, -23)\) leftward to \((-23, -23)\)):

\[
\text{Number at } (x, -23): 2209 - (23 - x)
\]

since moving left decreases \(x\) by 1 at each step, starting at \(x=23\), number at \(x\):

\[
N = 2209 - (23 - x) = 2209 - 23 + x = 2186 + x
\]

 For \(x=22\):

\[
N = 2186 + 22 = 2208
\]

Similarly, at \(x=21\):

\[
N= 2186+21= 2207
\]

and so forth.

---

### **Calculate neighbor numbers:**

- **Up neighbor \((22, -22)\):**

  - On the left side (after moving along bottom side), the coordinates:

  - The left side runs from \((-23, -23)\) to \((-23, 23)\):

  - The start at \((-23, -23)\) has number:

\[
N = 2209 - (23 - (-23)) = 2209 - 46 = 2163
\]

- The number increases by 1 for each step **up** along \(y\):

\[
N_{(x,y)} = \text{start number} + (\text{difference in } y)
\]

since moving from \((-23, -23)\) to \((-23, y)\), the number is:

\[
N = 2163 + (y - (-23)) = 2163 + y + 23 = 2186 + y
\]

At \((22, -22)\), prior calculation for \(N\):

\[
N = 2186 + y = 2186 + (-22) = 2164
\]

Similarly, for each neighbor:

| Neighbor             | Coordinates            | Calculation                                    | Number          |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Up**               | \((22, -22)\)          | \(2164\)                                       | \(2164\)        |
| **Down**             | \((22, -24)\)          | \(2186 + (-24) = 2162\)                        | \(2162\)        |
| **Left**             | \((21, -23)\)          | Bottom side: \(N=2186 + x\) at \((x, -23)\) | \(2186 + 21=2207\) |
| **Right**            | \((23, -23)\)          | Our current position (the cell itself)         | \(2026\)        |
| **Up-left**          | \((21, -22)\)          | On the left side \(N=2186 + y\)             | \(2186 + (-22)=2164\) |
| **Up-right**         | \((23, -22)\)          | On the left side \(N=2186 + y\) with \(x=23\), \(y=-22\)  | \(2186 + (-22)=2164\) |
| **Down-left**        | \((21, -24)\)          | \(N=2186 + y =2186 + (-24)=2162\)          | \(2162\)        |
| **Down-right**       | \((23, -24)\)          | \(N=2186 + y = 2186 + (-24)=2162\)          | \(2162\)        |

---

### **Conclusion:**

The **neighbors' numbers**:

- Up: **2164**
- Down: **2162**
- Left: **2207**
- Up-left: **2164**
- Up-right: **2164**
- Down-left: **2162**
- Down-right: **2162**

(Note: The right neighbor is our original number **2026**, which we don't include as a neighbor.)

---

### **Final step: Calculate the sum**

Sum of neighbors:

\[
2164 + 2162 + 2207 + 2164 + 2164 + 2162 + 2162
\]

Count how many and add:

Sum:

\[
(2164 \text{ thrice}) + (2162 \text{ thrice}) + 2207
\]

Calculate:

\[
(3 \times 2164) + (3 \times 2162) + 2207
\]

\[
= (6492) + (6486) + 2207 = (6492 + 6486) + 2207
\]

\[
= 12978 + 2207 = 15185
\]

---

## **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15185}
\]

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **15,185**.
