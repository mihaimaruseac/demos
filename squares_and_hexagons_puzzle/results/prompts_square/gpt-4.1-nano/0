Let's analyze the problem carefully.

**Understanding the layout:**

The spiral is laid out on a square grid of natural numbers, starting at 1 in the very center, and extending outward in layers. The pattern shown suggests that:

- The number 1 is at the center.
- Successive layers form concentric squares around it, with numbers increasing as you go outward in a spiral.

The provided partial layout:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

This looks like the *standard* Ulam spiral starting at 1 in the center, moving right, then down, left, up, increasing outward.

---

### Step 1: Confirm the spiral pattern and indexing

Typically, the spiral pattern works as follows:

- Start at 1 at the center (coordinates (0, 0)).
- The pattern of movement:

  1. Move one step right to (1, 0), place 2.
  2. Move up to (1, 1), place 3.
  3. Move left two steps: (0, 1) and (-1, 1), placing 4 and 5.
  4. Move down two steps: (-1, 0), (-1, -1), placing 6 and 7.
  5. Move right three steps: (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), placing 8, 9, 10.
  6. Continue expanding outward in similar pattern.

Alternatively, the spiral is generated by layers:

- Layer n: perimeter of the square from \(-n\) to \(n\) (coordinates):

  - The upper-right corner of layer n: \((n, n)\).
  - Total numbers up to layer n can be derived.

---

### Step 2: Find the position of 2026

Given the pattern, the position of a number k in the spiral can be related to its "layer" n.

Number of elements in layers up to n:

- Layer 0 (center): 1 element (number 1).

- Each new layer n adds:

  \[
  \text{Number of elements} = (2n + 1)^2
  \]
  
  Because the total number of elements up to layer n is \((2n + 1)^2\).

We want to find n such that:

\[
(2n - 1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2n + 1)^2
\]

Let’s solve for n:

\[
(2n + 1)^2 \geq 2026
\]
\[
2n + 1 \geq \sqrt{2026}
\]

Calculate \(\sqrt{2026}\):

\[
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01
\]

Then:

\[
2n + 1 \geq 45.01
\]
\[
2n \geq 44.01
\]
\[
n \geq 22.005
\]

Since n must be integer, n ≥ 23.

Check:

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

And:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

2026 is just after 2025 but less than or equal to 2209, so:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 2209 \geq 2026
\]

And:

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 2025 < 2026
\]

Thus, the number 2026 lies in **layer n = 23**.

---

### Step 3: Find the position of 2026 within the layer

- Total numbers up to layer 22:

\[
(2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

- The numbers in layer 23 go from:

\[
2026 \text{ (first number in layer 23)} \text{ to } 2209
\]

- The first number in layer 23 is 2026.

Number of elements in layer 23:

\[
(2 \times 23 + 1)^2 - (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 2209 - 2025 = 184
\]

So, 2026 is the **first element** in layer 23.

---

### Step 4: Coordinates of 2026 in the spiral

In the spiral pattern:

- The layer n corresponds to a square with side length \(2n + 1\).
  
- The minimum number in layer n is \((2n - 1)^2 + 1\), and the maximum is \((2n + 1)^2\).

- For layer 23:

  - The starting number is:

    \[
    (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026
    \]
  - The ending number is 2209.

- The side length:

  \[
  2 \times 23 + 1 = 47
  \]
  
- The total numbers in layer 23: 184, starting at 2026.

- The bottom right corner of layer 23:

  Coordinates:

  \[
  (n, -n)
  \]
  
  With the numbers increasing along the perimeter, starting from the bottom right corner.

Knowing the pattern for the positions: 

In the standard spiral, the numbers increase along the four sides:

- Bottom row: from \((n, -n)\) to \((-n, -n)\)
- Left column: from \((-n, -n)\) to \((-n, n)\)
- Top row: from \((-n, n)\) to \((n, n)\)
- Right column: from \((n, n)\) to \((n, -n+1)\)

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, it coincides with the bottom right corner:

\[
(23, -23)
\]

---

### Step 5: Coordinates of 2026

- Number 2026: at coordinate \((23, -23)\).

- The next numbers fill the perimeter in this order:

  1. Along the bottom side (from \((23, -23)\) to \((-23, -23)\)),
  2. Up the left side from \((-23, -23)\) to \((-23, 23)\),
  3. Along the top from \((-23, 23)\) to \((23, 23)\),
  4. Down the right side from \((23, 23)\) to \((23, -22)\).

- To find the position of 2026, note it's at the starting corner of this perimeter:

  - It's at \((23, -23)\).

---

### Step 6: Find neighbors of 2026

Neighbors are the 8 surrounding cells:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
(i-1, j+1) & (i, j+1) & (i+1, j+1) \\
(i-1, j) & & (i+1, j) \\
(i-1, j-1) & (i, j-1) & (i+1, j-1)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

with \((i,j) = (23, -23)\).

Neighbors:

- \((22, -22)\)
- \((23, -22)\)
- \((24, -22)\)
- \((22, -23)\)
- \((24, -23)\)
- \((22, -24)\)
- \((23, -24)\)
- \((24, -24)\)

---

### Step 7: Determine the numbers at these neighboring coordinates

We need to find the number at each neighbor coordinate. The coordinate system:

- \(i\): x-coordinate (from \(-n\) to \(n\))
- \(j\): y-coordinate (from \(-n\) to \(n\))

Numbering along the perimeter:

- We know that at the bottom right corner: \((n, -n)\), number is 2026.

- Moving along perimeter:

---

### Step 8: Find the pattern for numbering at given coordinates

The perimeter of layer \(n\) has length:

\[
8n
\]

(4 sides, each of length \(2n\); except for corners which are counted once).

Numbering:

- Starting at \((n, -n)\) with number 2026.

- Proceeding:

  1. Along bottom side: from \((n, -n)\) to \((-n, -n)\):

  \[
  \text{Number of steps} = n + n = 2n
  \]

  2. Up left side: from \((-n, -n)\) to \((-n, n)\):

  \[
  2n
  \]

  3. Along top side: from \((-n, n)\) to \((n, n)\):

  \[
  2n
  \]

  4. Down right side: from \((n, n)\) back to \((n, -n)\):

  \[
  2n
  \]

Total:

\[
8n
\]

Starting at \((n, -n)\) with number:

\[
N_{start} = (2n - 1)^2 + 1
\]

In our case:

\[
n=23
\]
\[
N_{start} = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026
\]

which matches the number at \((23, -23)\).

---

### Step 9: Find the number at each neighbor coordinate

- **Neighbor \((22, -22)\):**

  Located one step along the bottom side from \((23, -23)\).

  Along the bottom side:

  - Starts at \((n, -n) = (23, -23)\) with number 2026.
  
  - Moving left towards \((-n, -n)\): the x decreases by 1, y remains the same.

  - Each step reduces the x-coordinate by 1, increasing the number by 1.

  So:

  \[
  N_{bottom\_start} = 2026
  \]
  
  \[
  N_{(x, -n)} = N_{bottom\_start} - (n - x)
  \]

For \((22, -22)\):

\[
x=22,\quad n=23
\]

Number:

\[
N_{(22, -22)} = 2026 - (23 - 22) = 2026 - 1 = 2025
\]

- **Neighbor \((23, -22)\):**

  - Directly above \((23, -23)\), moving up the right side.

  - Moving from bottom corner up:

    Each step increases y by 1, number increases by 1.

  From \((23, -23)\) to \((23, -22)\):

\[
N_{(23, -22)} = 2026 + 1 = 2027
\]

- **Neighbor \((24, -22)\):**

  - To find this, note that:

    Our layer side is only from \(-n\) to \(n\), so \((24, -22)\) outside the current perimeter boundary.

  However, the perimeter boundary for layer 23 is from \(x=-23\) to \(x=23\), so:

  - \((24, -22)\) is outside the layer.

  But the grid could be extended, but per the problem statement, we focus on neighbors within the grid, i.e., the immediate 8.

**Assumption:**

Since the layer boundary is at \(|x|=n\), \((24, -22)\) is outside, so perhaps the neighbor in that direction does not exist, or the number is not assigned.

But the problem asks for neighbors in the *spiral layout*, so coordinates outside the layer would be non-existent or outside the numbering pattern.

From the pattern, only neighbors within the same layer perimeter are valid.

**Therefore**, the neighbors:

| Position                 | Coordinates        | Inside the layer? | Number estimate                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| \((22, -22)\)            | \((22, -22)\)       | Yes              | 2025                                    |
| \((23, -22)\)            | \((23, -22)\)       | Yes              | 2027                                    |
| \((24, -22)\)            | \((24, -22)\)       | Outside layer?   | Outside perimeter, ignore/not count?   |
| \((22, -23)\)            | \((22, -23)\)       | Yes              | ?

Similarly for the other neighbors, following same logic.

---

### Step 10: Coordinates for all neighbors and their assigned numbers

- \((22, -22)\): on bottom side, shifted one step left.

  Number = previous bottom corner number (2026) minus the difference in \(x\):

  \[
  2026 - (n - x) = 2026 - (23 - 22) = 2025
  \]

- \((23, -22)\): directly above starting corner plus steps along side:

  \[
  2026 + (y - (-23)) = 2026 + ( -22 - (-23)) = 2026 + 1 = 2027
  \]

- \((24, -22)\): outside further away from the perimeter, outside the layer, so probably outside the spiral's numbering at that boundary.

Let's check neighbors inside the perimeter:

Neighbors inside:

- \((22, -22)\) with value 2025.

- \((23, -22)\) with value 2027.

- \((22, -23)\):

  Moving along bottom side:

  - \((22, -23)\) is one step further left from \((23, -23)\).

  - Number: 2026 - (23 - 22) = 2025.

- \((24, -23)\):

  Outside the boundary, ignore.

- \((23, -24)\):

  Outside the layer, ignore.

- \((21, -22)\):

  Further left, outside, ignore.

- \((23, -24)\):

  Outside, ignore.

- \((22, -24)\):

  Outside.

From this, the **neighbors within the grid**:

- \((22, -22) = 2025\)

- \((23, -22) = 2027\)

- \((22, -23) = 2025\)

- \((23, -23) = 2026\) (our number)

- \((24, -22)\): outside, ignore.

- \((24, -23)\): outside, ignore.

- \((21, -22)\): outside, ignore.

- \((23, -24)\): outside.

---

### **Final step: sum of the 8 neighbors**

Neighbors:

1. \((22, -22) = 2025\)
2. \((23, -22) = 2027\)
3. \((22, -23) = 2025\)
4. \((23, -24)\): outside grid, ignore
5. \((24, -22)\): outside grid, ignore
6. \((24, -23)\): outside grid, ignore
7. \((21, -22)\): outside
8. \((23, -24)\): outside

**Sum of all 8 neighbors:**

\[
2025 + 2027 + 2025 = 6077
\]

---

### **Answer:**

\[
\boxed{6077}
\]
