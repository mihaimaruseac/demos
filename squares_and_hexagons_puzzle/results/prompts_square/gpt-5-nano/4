Reason (sketch):
- The spiral has 1 at (0,0), increasing clockwise. The ring with radius k has max (2k+1)^2 at (k,-k).
- For n = 2026, find k with (2k+1)^2 ≥ 2026. Here k = 23, since 45^2 = 2025 < 2026 ≤ 47^2 = 2209.
- The first number on ring k is (2k-1)^2 + 1 = 2026, at (k, -k+1) = (23, -22). So 2026 is at (23, -22).
- The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:
  (22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23), (22,-22), (24,-22), (22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21).

Using the standard coordinate-to-number mapping for this spiral, their values are:
- (22,-23) = 2208
- (23,-23) = 2209
- (24,-23) = 2210
- (22,-22) = 2025
- (24,-22) = 2211
- (22,-21) = 1850
- (23,-21) = 2027
- (24,-21) = 2212

Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 16952.
