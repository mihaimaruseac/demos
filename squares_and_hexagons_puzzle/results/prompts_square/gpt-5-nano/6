Reason (sketch):
- The spiral has rings; 2025 is the bottom-right corner of ring 22, at (22, -22). The next number, 2026, is at (23, -22), the first cell on the right edge of ring 23.
- The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:
  (22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23),
  (22,-22), (24,-22),
  (22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21).

Using the standard ring formulas, these evaluate to:
- (22,-23) = 2208
- (23,-23) = 2209
- (24,-23) = 2210
- (22,-22) = 2025
- (24,-22) = 2211
- (22,-21) = 1850
- (23,-21) = 2027
- (24,-21) = 2212

Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 16952.
