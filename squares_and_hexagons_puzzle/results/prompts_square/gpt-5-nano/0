Reason (sketch):
- In this spiral, 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), and the layer m consists of numbers from (2m−1)^2+1 to (2m+1)^2, with the first of layer m at (m, −(m−1)).
- 2025 is the bottom-right of layer 22, at (22, −22). The next number, 2026, is the start of layer 23 at (23, −22).
- The eight neighbors of (23, −22) are:
  - (22, −23) = 2208
  - (23, −23) = 2209
  - (24, −23) = 2210
  - (22, −22) = 2025
  - (24, −22) = 2211
  - (22, −21) = 1850
  - (23, −21) = 2027
  - (24, −21) = 2212
- Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 16952.
