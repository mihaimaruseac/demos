Reasoning:
- The spiral has 1 at the center. The square of odd side length (2r+1)^2 lies at the bottom-right corner (r, -r). 
- 2026 is just after 2025 = 45^2, which is the bottom-right corner of ring r=22. Hence 2026 is on ring r=23 and located at (23, -22).
- The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:
  (22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23),
  (22,-22), (24,-22),
  (22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21).

- For a cell (x,y), let n = max(|x|,|y|) and t = (2n+1)^2. Then the value is:
  - if y = -n: t - (n - x)
  - else if x = -n and y ≠ n: t - 2n - (n - y)
  - else if y = n: t - 4n - (n + x)
  - else: t - 6n - (n + y)

Applying this to the eight coordinates gives:
- (22,-23) = 2208
- (23,-23) = 2209
- (24,-23) = 2256
- (22,-22) = 2025
- (24,-22) = 2255
- (22,-21) = 1892
- (23,-21) = 2069
- (24,-21) = 2254

Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2256 + 2025 + 2255 + 1892 + 2069 + 2254 = 17168.
