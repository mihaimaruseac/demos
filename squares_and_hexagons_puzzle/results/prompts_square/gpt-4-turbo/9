To solve this problem, notice the pattern used to place numbers in the spiral grid pattern as they increase. We want to find the position of 2026 and determine what numbers are around it.

In a spiral that is laid out on a square grid, numbers increase both outward in a spiral fashion and depending on their direction (right, up, left, or down). The principal difficulty is identifying the particular neighbors of a specific number, like 2026, in the spiral.

Due to the complexity and the non-linearity of such a spiral, finding the neighbors without visual representation or direct calculation tool (like a programmed script to generate the grid) might not be straightforward. Let's attempt a calculation approach:

### Estimation of Position and Layers:
Every layer of the spiral (except the first) adds an increasing perimeter of numbers. The first layer (centre) has exactly 1 number, the second layer (surrounding the centre) contains the next 8 numbers, and each subsequent layer adds numbers in increasing steps.

1. **Layer 1** (Size: 1 x 1): 1 number.
2. **Layer 2** (Size: 3 x 3): 8 numbers (2 to 9).
3. **Layer 3** (Size: 5 x 5): 16 numbers (10 to 25).
4. **Layer 4** (Size: 7 x 7): 24 numbers (26 to 49).

Generally, for Layer \( n \), it contains \( 8(n-1) \) numbers.

Calculating a few more layers:
- Layer 5 (9 x 9) contains 32 numbers: till 81.
- Layer 10 (19 x 19) contains 72 numbers: till 361.
- Layer 20 (39 x 39) contains 152 numbers: till 1681.
- Layer 25 (49 x 49) contains 192 numbers: till 2401.

Noting that 2026 is less than 2401, it falls into one of these layers. We can deduce that it is closest to layer 24 or the very start of layer 25.

### Neighbors in the Grid:
Numbers fill the spiral layer by layer, moving sequentially outward. Assuming 2026 is in the middle of a side (parallel to the calculation for exactly which side and location will need more specific sequence calculation), its neighbors will be:

1. Diagonally positioned from the previous (internal) layer.
2. Adjacent side neighbors.
3. Diagonally positioned on the next layer.

### Summation:
Without the exact position, we can't state the exact neighbors, and calculating the sum of those 8 specific numbers based on their spiral position relative to 2026 becomes theoretically technical and virtually impractical to solve without computer assistance or a graphical representation.

### Conclusion:
In practical terms, this problem, as posed, generally can't be easily solved manually due to the nature of the spiral pattern complexity unless more information about the positions or a direct visual/grid representation of number positions is available. Typically, it would either require a visual representation or a programming approach to populate the grid and allow identification of specific neighbors of a given number.
