To solve this problem, you must understand how the numbers are distributed on the spiral grid around the number 2026. A crucial observation from studying the spiral pattern is that the grid grows outward in concentric square "rings," where each successive ring entirely surrounds the inner ring.

Here, the critical realization is that with each layer, moving outward from the number 1 at the center, numbers on the grid increase sequentially as we spiral clockwise.

### Step 1: Determine the Ring of the Number 2026

To determine which ring 2026 is on, estimate by calculating the square root of 2026 and examine rings around the center. Let's find the layer or ring first:

- Each ring encloses a square of increasing odd numbers (1^2, 3^2, 5^2, ...)
- \(1^2 = 1\), \(3^2 = 9\), \(5^2 = 25\), \(7^2 = 49\), \(9^2 = 81\), \(11^2 = 121\), ...
- Continue up until you get close to 2026. 

The highest square ≤ 2026 that fits an odd-powered square pattern is \(43^2 = 1849\). Thus, 2026 falls within the ring that extends beyond \(43^2\) and includes numbers up to \(45^2 = 2025\). 

**Note**: Until this step, we defined the bounds narrowly; however, since the ring grows incrementally, let's correct this as the number 2026 is barely on an estimate to be within the ring extending to \(45^2\), rather than \(43^2\), since \(45^2 = 2025\).

### Step 2: Location of 2026 on its Ring

- As \(44^2 = 1936\) and \(45^2 = 2025\), this means that the 2026 position would be just beginning from \(44,\, 44\) on our centered Cartesian grid, moving along the rightward horizontal and top vertical arms (since the spiral moves inward).

### Step 3: Numbers around 2026

Since the side length of this ring of numbers is 45 (ring starts with 1937 and ends by circling back at 2025), 2026 falls at, let's suggest, roughly the midpoint of the side. For easy approximation,
- Numbers immediately preceding and succeeding 2026 will be 2025 and 2027.
- Corners (like 2028, 2024, etc.) will be adjacent numbers.
- Numbers wrapping onto the other sides of the ring diagonally aligned will likely be around these numbers too.

### Step 4 (estimated): Calculating approximate neighbors
- Assume neighbors are: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2025, 2027, 2035, 2036, 2037 (these are estimates as exact calculations would require mapping the precise spiral path, which isn't feasible without exact modeling or algorithm support).

For the sum of these numbers:  
\( 2015 + 2016 + 2017 + 2025 + 2027 + 2035 + 2036 + 2037 = 16108.\)

This calculation is based on assumptions around the symmetric behavior of numbers in the rings; for exact values, you would visually map these or use a more complex computational model. This solution serves as a generalized heuristic, and the actual numbers may vary slightly based on the precise layout of the spiral.
