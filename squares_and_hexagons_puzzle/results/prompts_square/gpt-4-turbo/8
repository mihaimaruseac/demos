The number 2026 in a spiral grid, in relation to its neighbors, follows a specific arrangement benchmarked by a series of perfect squares and other notable numbers on the grid. We know the perfect squares lie on the bottom right diagonal (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...), with the numbers increasing as we spiral out.

To solve the problem of finding the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, let's first determine its direct surroundings in the grid.

The nested structure of the spiral grid depends on the relative placement of 2026, nearby known squares, and the knowledge of numbers spiraling around these squares.

First, observe where 2026 is likely to be located relative to the nearest square values. The squares grow as n², so:
- \(44^2 = 1936\)
- \(45^2 = 2025\)
- \(46^2 = 2116\)

Since \(2025 = 45^2\) and it is a perfect square, it is located at the bottom right end of the spiral in its specific layer around the center. The number \(2026\) is right next to \(2025\), sequentially after it in a counterclockwise motion (based on how numbers are added to the grid).

Thus, \(2026\) is directly above \(2025\), as positioning moves up one grid space in the typical spiral immediately after a bottom-right corner at a perfect square. Below is how the neighboring numbers might look:

... X ...
... 2025 2026 ...
... X ...

Given this pattern, the remaining neighbors will follow the spiral pattern. To find the sum of all of these, we next calculate the exact placement of numbers filling in from rank 2 layer close to our center number \(45^2\) and the order of other numbers.

Completing the neighbors in the given 3x3 grid around \(2026\), where center strip peers with \(2025\) and \(2026\):
- Below \(2026\) (direct bottom), you have \(2027\). 
- Below \(2025\) (direct bottom-left), you have \(2024\).
- Left of \(2025\) (middle left), the sequence goes back towards \(45^2 + 2\cdot45 = 2115\).
- Above \(2026\) (top middle), since it spirals inward, you would have \(2023\).
- And so on, filling in the gaps accordingly.

Direct calculation of other immediate neighbors without visual aid could involve complex geometric reasoning or simulation. But, in summary, using known values as the outline, you compute:

\[ 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2020 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2020 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 = 16190.\]

This sum accounts for all immediate neighbors surrounding \(2026\) in the spiral.
