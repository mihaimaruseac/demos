To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the described square-spiral grid, we first need to determine the position of 2026 within the grid and then identify the numbers surrounding it.

### Step 1: Determine the Ring Number
A natural-number spiral on a square grid expands outward in concentric layers or "rings." The spiral starts with 1 at the center and then moves right, up, left, and down, growing in size with each complete cycle. Each new outer ring has an odd-numbered length for its sides, which increases progressively. For instance:
- The 1x1 grid contains just `1`.
- The 3x3 grid (surrounding the 1x1) extends to `9`.
- The 5x5 grid (surrounding the 3x3) extends to `25`.

To find the right ring for 2026:
1. Determine the odd square roots nearest to 2026:
   \[ \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01 \]
   Since we consider the greatest odd integer ≤ 45.01, we round down to 45 if 45 is too big for the perfect square that still includes 2026, we consider the next smallest odd square.
   
2. The squares of odd integers near 45 are:
   \[ 43^2 = 1849, \quad 45^2 = 2025 \]
   \[ 47^2 = 2209 \]
   Since \(45^2 = 2025\) is just one less than 2026, \(2026\) lies on the first square of the 47x47 grid (the grid with 45^2 to 47^2).

### Step 2: Location of 2026
2026 is the next number after 2025, which means it occupies the position immediately after the final (largest) number of the 45x45 square, which lies at square bottom right corner. In moving to the next ring:
- Starting from 2025 (bottom-right of the 45x45 square), 2026 is one step into the new layer (47x47 ring) positioned on the bottom right corner just outside the prior ring's bottom right.

### Step 3: Identify Neighbors
In a square grid, the neighbors of 2026 (which is positioned just as described above) will be as follows:
- Vertically and horizontally adjacent as well as diagonally adjacent numbers, positioned as part of both the 45x45 and 47x47 rings.
- Approximately these numbers would increment from 2025 in a zigzag manner because of the spiral. The location makes it a corner of the 45x45 layer:
   \[ 2025, 2024, (possibly) 2023 \] to the left, upper-left, and above 2025.
   \[ 2027, 2028, 2029 \] in the 47x47 ring moving away from 2025/2026.
   
Calculating exact positions without visual aid is complex, especially as the numbering winds intricately. It typically requires more precise tracking of the spiraling sequence than described here, possibly aided by drawing or using software.

### Step 4: Actual Calculation
- The exact sum of these neighbors requires either tracing them on an actual grid or a highly accurate imagining/modelling of the spiral progression.

Given the difficulty in precision without more extensive visual aids, I recommend plotting a very exact diagram or using specific software designed to generate such spirals to count accurately.
