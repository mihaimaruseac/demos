To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid, we need to figure out the location of the number 2026 on the grid and then identify the numbers around it.

Let's start by pinpointing the location of 2026. To do this, we need to understand the spiraling pattern.

**Approach to Understand Spiral Pattern**:
1. **Center**: Number 1 is at the origin (0,0).
2. **First Layer** around 1 (comprising numbers from 2 to 9) increases the spiral radius by one unit. This layer has a side length of 3 (as evident from 2 to 9).
3. **Subsequent Layers**: With each new layer, the side length of the square increases by 2.

We need to determine which layer 2026 is on and exactly where it is located within that layer.

To find which layer a number n lies in, observe:
- Layer 1 radius = 1 (including numbers up to 9)
- Layer 2 radius = 2 (including numbers up to 25: \(3^2 to 5^2[9+1 to 25]\))
- Layer 3 radius = 3 (including numbers up to 49: \(5^2 to 7^2[25+1 to 49]\))
  
The spiral goes outward, with every odd square \( (2k+1)\times(2k+1) \), where \( k \) is the layer's radius-1. The maximum number in a layer is the square of the side length, which is \( (2k+1)^2 \).

Calculate \( k \) so that \( (2k+1)^2 \) closely precedes 2026:
1. \( 43^2 = 1849 \)
2. \( 45^2 = 2025 \)
3. \( 47^2 = 2209 \)

Because 2026 falls between \( 2025 (45^2) \) and 2209 (\( 47^2 \)), it is in the layer that starts with \( 45^2 + 1 = 2026 \). Thus, 2026 is the start of a new outward layer and bounds extremely close to the central spiral.

Looking at the layout, we see that as a pattern emerges every time you start a new square, the beginning location of 2026 (after 2025) is the north-most position of its layer, i.e., directly above the last number of the next inner layer, considering the spiral rotates counter-clockwise.

Therefore, the neighbors of 2026 are as follows (considering its starting north-most location in layer):
- North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, North-West locations relative to 2026.

Given \( 2026 \) is at the start, its neighbors in the spiral are:
- \( 2025, 2026+1, 2026+2 \) (around the start position: two spaces to its right),
- The numbers directly corresponding in the previous layers, i.e., \( 2024 \),
- Further, the corresponding positions that move diagonally outward as we follow the spiral pattern (up to \( 2027 \) and so forth within the spiral design).

Summing these up:
- \( 2026 \)'s immediate known neighbors are \( 2025, 2026+1, 2026+2 \), and \( 2027 \).

For the exact details without more layout or algorithm-computed paths, implementing a specific programming model or manual computation based on expanding the pattern might be necessary for precise answers. However, this illustrates examining neighbors around 2026 in the sequence.
