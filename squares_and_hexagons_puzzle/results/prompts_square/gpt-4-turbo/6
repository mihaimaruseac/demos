To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a square spiral layout, we first need to identify the positions of these neighboring numbers.

In this type of spiral arrangement:
1. 1 starts at the center.
2. Numbers increase outwards in a counter-clockwise spiral pattern.

We can recognize a pattern in the placement of numbers in this grid structure based on the spirals:
- Numbers increase as they move left from the center, right from the left edge, down from the top right, left from the lower right, up from the lower left, and then the process repeats with increasing distance from the center for each complete turn around the center.

To determine the position of 2026 and subsequently its neighbors:
- The number 1 is at position (0,0) in center.
- As numbers increase, they form concentric layers (or rings) around the center. Each complete layer (ring) corresponds to successive odd-numbered squares (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc.).

We can calculate the ring number where 2026 would appear, and then its position in that ring. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:
- The ring containing 2026 can be inferred from the side length that just surpasses the square root of 2026. An estimated approach, without specific numeric calculation for the precise ring, reveals it's around \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \). Fewer than 47 and more than 43, as \( 47^2 = 2209 \) and \( 43^2 = 1849 \).
- Therefore, 2026 is close to the boundary between the 43x43 square and the 45x45 square. We can check further between these two but approximate that it's in the region of moving from the first to the second after the completion of the 43x43 layers.

Next, to find the 8 surrounding numbers of 2026 without specific coordinate calculus:
- In general, each number n on the spiral grid is surrounded by:
  - North (n-1 or n+1 or similar pattern but displaced),
  - Northeast,
  - East,
  - Southeast,
  - South,
  - Southwest,
  - West,
  - Northwest.

However, determining the exact numbers requires calculating the exact position in the sequence or grid, which involves more specific and detailed computing or programming, not readily solvable by hand given the complexity of positioning in larger number spirals.

Usually, the value difference to neighboring numbers in sequential rings is consistent based on direction until we start a new layer; it depends on whether the movement in the sequence is outward expansion or the inward closing of a spiral ring.

Thus, this problem to be solved efficiently and accurately may indeed need programmatically deriving the neighbors in this specific layout due to the highly sequential and structured yet intricate pattern of number increments. This would involve simulating the spiral until reaching 2026 and then directly querying its neighbors, rather than purely analytical computation.
