To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the number spiral, we first determine the position of 2026 within the spiral structure.

The spiral is constructed such that the square of an odd number $n$, $n^2$, is located at the bottom-right corner of a square layer.
The perfect square closest to 2026 is $45^2 = 2025$.
Since 45 is odd, 2025 is located at the coordinates $(22, -22)$ (assuming the center 1 is at $(0,0)$).
The number 2026 is $2025 + 1$. In the spiral pattern, after reaching the end of a layer at $(k, -k)$, the next number starts the new layer at $(k+1, -k)$.
Thus, for $2025$ ($k=22$), the number $2026$ is located at $(23, -22)$.

We need to find the numbers surrounding 2026 at $(23, -22)$. The 8 neighbors correspond to the coordinates $(x, y)$ where $x \in \{22, 23, 24\}$ and $y \in \{-21, -22, -23\}$, excluding the center $(23, -22)$.

Let's identify the values based on the spiral layers. 2026 is the starting number of the $23^{rd}$ "ring" (where ring $m$ ends at $(2m+1)^2$). Here $m=23$, ending at $47^2 = 2209$.
The neighbors are distributed across ring 22 (inner), ring 23 (current), and ring 24 (outer).

1.  **Left Neighbor $(22, -22)$**: This is the number immediately preceding 2026.
    Value: **2025** ($45^2$).

2.  **Top Neighbor $(23, -21)$**: From 2026, the spiral moves upwards along the right edge of the current ring.
    Value: $2026 + 1 =$ **2027**.

3.  **Top-Left Neighbor $(22, -21)$**: This position is the start of the vertical segment of the previous ring (Ring 22). Ring 22 starts after $43^2 = 1849$ at $(21, -21)$, so $(22, -21)$ is the next step.
    Value: $1849 + 1 =$ **1850**.

4.  **Bottom-Right Neighbor $(24, -23)$**: This position is the start of the next ring (Ring 24). Ring 23 ends at $47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. The next number steps right to $(24, -23)$.
    Value: $2209 + 1 =$ **2210**.

5.  **Right Neighbor $(24, -22)$**: Moving up from the start of Ring 24 (2210).
    Value: $2210 + 1 =$ **2211**.

6.  **Top-Right Neighbor $(24, -21)$**: Moving up again in Ring 24.
    Value: $2211 + 1 =$ **2212**.

7.  **Bottom Neighbor $(23, -23)$**: This is the corner of Ring 23, the perfect square of the layer.
    Value: $47^2 =$ **2209**.

8.  **Bottom-Left Neighbor $(22, -23)$**: This point is on the bottom edge of Ring 23, immediately to the left of 2209.
    Value: $2209 - 1 =$ **2208**.

Now, we sum these 8 neighbors:
Sum $= 2025 + 2027 + 1850 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2209 + 2208$

Grouping the numbers for easier addition:
Group 1 (Small): $1850$
Group 2 (Medium): $2025 + 2027 = 4052$
Group 3 (Large): $2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$
This large group is an arithmetic progression with 5 terms centered at 2210.
Sum of Group 3 $= 5 \times 2210 = 11050$.

Total Sum $= 1850 + 4052 + 11050$
Total Sum $= 5902 + 11050$
Total Sum $= 16952$

Answer: **16952**
