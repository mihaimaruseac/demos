To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the grid.

**Step 1: Locate 2026 on the grid**
The natural numbers are arranged in a square spiral. Notice the pattern of perfect odd squares:
- $1^2 = 1$ is at the center $(0,0)$.
- $3^2 = 9$ is at $(1, -1)$.
- $5^2 = 25$ is at $(2, -2)$.
- Generally, $(2n+1)^2$ is located at $(n, -n)$, which is the bottom-right corner of the square shell of size $(2n+1) \times (2n+1)$.

We find the odd perfect square closest to 2026.
$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$.
The closest odd square is $45^2 = 2025$.
Since $45 = 2(22) + 1$, we have $n=22$.
The number 2025 is located at coordinates $(22, -22)$.

The spiral continues from the bottom-right corner $(n, -n)$ by moving one step to the **Right** to start the next shell, then moving **Up**.
- 2025 is at $(22, -22)$.
- 2026 is at $(23, -22)$.

Let $N = 45$. The neighbors of 2026 are the 8 surrounding grid points centered at $(23, -22)$.
Let's denote the coordinates relative to the shells. 2026 is on the "inner" side of the vertical arm of the new shell (Shell 23) or effectively between Shell 22, 23, and 24 due to the spiral layering.

**Step 2: Identify the Neighbors and Calculate their Values**
The neighbors are at coordinates $(x, y)$ where $x \in \{22, 23, 24\}$ and $y \in \{-21, -22, -23\}$.

1.  **Left $(22, -22)$**: This is 2025 ($N^2$).
    Value: **2025**

2.  **Left-Up $(22, -21)$**: This point is on the rising vertical edge of the previous shell (Shell 22). The previous shell started after $(N-2)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$. The start of that vertical edge is at $(22, -21)$ (one step Right from the end of Shell 21).
    Value: $1849 + 1 = \mathbf{1850}$.

3.  **Up $(23, -21)$**: This is the next step in the spiral after 2026.
    Value: $2026 + 1 = \mathbf{2027}$.

4.  **Left-Down $(22, -23)$**: This point is on the bottom horizontal edge of the current shell (Shell 23). Shell 23 ends at $(N+2)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. The point $(22, -23)$ is immediately to the left of the end.
    Value: $2209 - 1 = \mathbf{2208}$.

5.  **Down $(23, -23)$**: This is the end of Shell 23.
    Value: $47^2 = \mathbf{2209}$.

6.  **Right-Down $(24, -23)$**: This starts the next shell (Shell 24).
    Value: $2209 + 1 = \mathbf{2210}$.

7.  **Right $(24, -22)$**: The second point of Shell 24 (moving Up).
    Value: $2210 + 1 = \mathbf{2211}$.

8.  **Right-Up $(24, -21)$**: The third point of Shell 24 (moving Up).
    Value: $2211 + 1 = \mathbf{2212}$.

**Step 3: Sum the Neighbors**
The values are:
1850, 2027, 2212,
2025,       2211,
2208, 2209, 2210

Summing them up:
$1850 + 2027 + 2212 = 6089$
$2025 + 2211 = 4236$
$2208 + 2209 + 2210 = 6627$

Total Sum = $6089 + 4236 + 6627 = 16952$.

Alternatively, using the derived formula for the sum of neighbors of $N^2+1$:
$S = 8N^2 + 16N + 32$
With $N=45$:
$S = 8(2025) + 16(45) + 32$
$S = 16200 + 720 + 32 = 16952$

**Answer:**
16952
