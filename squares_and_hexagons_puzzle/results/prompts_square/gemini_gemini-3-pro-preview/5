To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first determine the position of 2026 on the spiral grid.

The spiral is constructed in layers or "shells". The square of an odd number $2n+1$, denoted as $M_n = (2n+1)^2$, is located at the coordinates $(n, -n)$. This position marks the end of the $n$-th shell (where the center 1 is shell 0).

We observe that $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$. The closest odd square less than 2026 is $45^2 = 2025$.
Let $2k+1 = 45$, which gives $k=22$.
Thus, $M_{22} = 2025$ is located at $(22, -22)$.

The number 2026 is $2025 + 1$. Following the spiral pattern, the step after completing the square at $(n, -n)$ is to the right, to $(n+1, -n)$.
So, 2026 is at $(23, -22)$.
This point is the start of shell 23 ($k+1$ where $k=22$).

Let's denote the coordinates of 2026 as $(x, y) = (23, -22)$.
The 8 neighbors are at $(x+\delta x, y+\delta y)$ for $\delta x, \delta y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
Based on the general derivation for a center point $C = M_k + 1$ (start of a shell), the sum of the neighbors $S$ is given by the formula:
$$S = M_{k-1} + 2M_k + 5M_{k+1} + 8$$
Here, $k=22$.
We calculate the squares $M_{k-1}, M_k, M_{k+1}$:
$M_{21} = (2(21)+1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$
$M_{22} = (2(22)+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$
$M_{23} = (2(23)+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$

Now, substitute these into the sum formula:
$$S = 1849 + 2(2025) + 5(2209) + 8$$
$$S = 1849 + 4050 + 11045 + 8$$
$$S = 16952$$

The individual neighbors are:
1.  Top-Left $(22, -21)$: 1850
2.  Left $(22, -22)$: 2025
3.  Top $(23, -21)$: 2027
4.  Bottom-Left $(22, -23)$: 2208
5.  Bottom $(23, -23)$: 2209
6.  Bottom-Right $(24, -23)$: 2210
7.  Right $(24, -22)$: 2211
8.  Top-Right $(24, -21)$: 2212

Summing these explicitly:
$1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952$.
