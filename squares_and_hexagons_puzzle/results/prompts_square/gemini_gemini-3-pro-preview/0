To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the position of 2026 on the spiral grid.

The spiral is constructed such that the square of an odd number $n = 2k+1$, $n^2$, is located at position $(k, -k)$ (using a coordinate system where 1 is at $(0,0)$, right is positive x, up is positive y).
The number just before 2026 is $2025$, which is $45^2$.
Since $45 = 2(22) + 1$, we have $k=22$. Thus, 2025 is located at $(22, -22)$.

The spiral continues from the square of an odd number by moving 1 step to the Right, then Up, Left, Down, Right to form the next layer.
So, 2026 is located 1 step to the Right of 2025.
Position of 2026: $(23, -22)$.

Let $(x, y) = (23, -22)$. We need to find the values at the 8 neighboring coordinates:
$(x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)$
$(x-1, y), \quad \quad \quad \quad (x+1, y)$
$(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1)$

These correspond to:
1.  **NW** $(22, -21)$
2.  **N** $(23, -21)$
3.  **NE** $(24, -21)$
4.  **W** $(22, -22)$
5.  **E** $(24, -22)$
6.  **SW** $(22, -23)$
7.  **S** $(23, -23)$
8.  **SE** $(24, -23)$

We determine the values based on the layer structure:
*   **W (22, -22)**: This is 2025.
*   **NW (22, -21)**: This is the start of Layer 22. The start of Layer $k$ is at $(k, -k+1)$ with value $(2k-1)^2 + 1$. For $k=22$, value is $43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.
*   **SW (22, -23)**: This is on the bottom edge of Layer 23, one step left of the end. The end of Layer 23 is $47^2 = 2209$ at $(23, -23)$. So SW is $2208$.
*   **N (23, -21)**: This is on Layer 23, one step Up from 2026. Value is $2026 + 1 = 2027$.
*   **S (23, -23)**: This is the end of Layer 23. Value $2209$.
*   **SE (24, -23)**: This is the start of Layer 24. Value is End of Layer 23 + 1 = $2209 + 1 = 2210$.
*   **E (24, -22)**: On Layer 24, one step Up from start. Value $2210 + 1 = 2211$.
*   **NE (24, -21)**: On Layer 24, two steps Up from start. Value $2210 + 2 = 2212$.

The 8 neighbors are:
1850, 2025, 2208, 2027, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Summing them:
$1850 + 2025 + 2208 = 6083$
$2027 + 2209 = 4236$
$2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 6633$
Total Sum = $6083 + 4236 + 6633 = 16952$.

Alternatively, using the derived formula $S = 8m^2 + 16m + 32$ with $m=45$:
$S = 8(2025) + 16(45) + 32 = 16200 + 720 + 32 = 16952$.

Answer: 16952
