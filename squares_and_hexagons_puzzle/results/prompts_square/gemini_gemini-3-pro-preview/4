The number 2026 is located on the spiral grid. Let's determine its position and the values of its neighbors.
The squares of odd integers $(2k+1)^2$ are located at positions $(k, -k)$ and mark the end of "Ring $k$".
For 2026, we note that $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
The square $45^2 = 2025$.
Since 45 is of the form $2k+1$ with $k=22$, the number 2025 is located at $(22, -22)$.
The spiral proceeds from the end of a ring by moving one step to the Right to start the next ring.
So, 2026 is at $(22+1, -22) = (23, -22)$.
This is the start of Ring 23 ($m=23$).

We need the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number $N=2026$ at $(23, -22)$.
Let $(x,y) = (23, -22)$. The neighbors are the positions $(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y)$ for $\Delta x, \Delta y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.
Using the structure of the spiral, we determined the values of the neighbors:
1.  **Left (L)** at $(22, -22)$: This is the number 2025.
2.  **Up-Left (UL)** at $(22, -21)$: This is the start of Ring 22, which is $43^2 + 1 = 1850$.
3.  **Up (U)** at $(23, -21)$: This is the next number after 2026 in Ring 23, so $2026+1 = 2027$.
4.  **Down (D)** at $(23, -23)$: This is the end of Ring 23, which is $47^2 = 2209$.
5.  **Down-Left (DL)** at $(22, -23)$: This is the number just before the end of Ring 23, so $2209-1 = 2208$.
6.  **Down-Right (DR)** at $(24, -23)$: This is the start of Ring 24, which is $47^2 + 1 = 2210$.
7.  **Right (R)** at $(24, -22)$: This is the second number in Ring 24, so $2210+1 = 2211$.
8.  **Up-Right (UR)** at $(24, -21)$: This is the third number in Ring 24, so $2210+2 = 2212$.

The values are: 2025, 1850, 2027, 2209, 2208, 2210, 2211, 2212.
Summing these values:
$2025 + 1850 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$
Grouping:
$2025 + 2027 = 4052$
$2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 11050$
$1850$
Total: $4052 + 11050 + 1850 = 16952$.

Alternatively, using the formula derived for the sum of neighbors of the starting element of ring $m$: $S_m = 32m^2 + 24$.
For $m=23$:
$S_{23} = 32(23^2) + 24 = 32(529) + 24 = 16928 + 24 = 16952$.

Answer: 16952
