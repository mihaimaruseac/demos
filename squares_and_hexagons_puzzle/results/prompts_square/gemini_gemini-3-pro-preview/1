To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral, we first need to determine the position of 2026 within the grid structure.

**1. Locate 2026 in the Spiral**

The spiral is constructed such that odd perfect squares $(1^2, 3^2, 5^2, \dots)$ lie on the diagonal extending downwards to the right from the center.
We look for the odd perfect square closest to 2026.
$\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$.
The nearest odd square is $n^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.

In the Ulam spiral coordinates (where 1 is at $(0,0)$, Right is $+x$, Up is $+y$):
*   An odd square $n^2$ (where $n=2k+1$) is located at $(k, -k)$.
*   For $n=45$, $k=22$. So, **2025** is located at **$(22, -22)$**.

The spiral continues from the odd square $n^2$ by moving 1 step to the Right to start the next layer, then proceeds Upwards.
*   **2026** is the immediate successor to 2025.
*   Position of 2026: Move Right from $(22, -22)$ to **$(23, -22)$**.

**2. Identify the Neighbors**

Let the position of 2026 be $(x, y) = (23, -22)$. We need to determine the values at the 8 surrounding coordinates: $x \in \{22, 23, 24\}$ and $y \in \{-21, -22, -23\}$.

We can deduce the values based on the structure of the spiral layers.
*   **Layer 22 ($n=45$):** Ends at 2025. The rightmost column ($x=22$) leading up to 2025 contains the rising sequence of the previous layer ($n-2=43$).
*   **Layer 23 ($n=47$):** Starts at 2026. It goes Up, then Left, then Down, then Right. It ends at $47^2 = 2209$.
*   **Layer 24 ($n=49$):** Starts after 2209.

Let's calculate the value for each neighbor position:

1.  **West (22, -22):** This is the position of the odd square **2025**.
2.  **Center (23, -22):** Our number **2026**.
3.  **North (23, -21):** The spiral moves Up from 2026. Value = $2026 + 1 = \mathbf{2027}$.
4.  **South (23, -23):** This position is the bottom-right corner of the current layer ($n=47$). The value is $47^2 = \mathbf{2209}$.
5.  **South-West (22, -23):** This is in the bottom row of the current layer ($n=47$), just before the corner. Value = $2209 - 1 = \mathbf{2208}$.
6.  **South-East (24, -23):** This is the start of the next layer ($n=49$). Spiral moves Right from 2209. Value = $2209 + 1 = \mathbf{2210}$.
7.  **East (24, -22):** The spiral moves Up from 2210. Value = $2210 + 1 = \mathbf{2211}$.
8.  **North-East (24, -21):** The spiral continues Up. Value = $2211 + 1 = \mathbf{2212}$.
9.  **North-West (22, -21):** This point is in the column $x=22$. This column corresponds to the upward path of the previous inner shell ($n=43$). The square $43^2 = 1849$ is at $(21, -21)$. The path moves Right to $(22, -21)$ to start the cycle for $n=45$. Value = $1849 + 1 = \mathbf{1850}$.

**3. Sum the Values**

The 8 neighbors are:
*   1850 (NW)
*   2027 (N)
*   2212 (NE)
*   2025 (W)
*   2211 (E)
*   2208 (SW)
*   2209 (S)
*   2210 (SE)

Sum = $1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210$

Grouping for easier addition:
*   $2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 11050$
*   $2025 + 2027 = 4052$
*   $1850$

Total = $11050 + 4052 + 1850 = 16952$.

(Alternatively, using the formula derived for this position type $S = 8n^2 + 16n + 32$ with $n=45$: $8(2025) + 16(45) + 32 = 16200 + 720 + 32 = 16952$.)
