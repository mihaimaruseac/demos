To determine the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to find the positions of its neighbors in the spiral. However, the task of manually tracing the spiral up to 2026 would be time-consuming and prone to errors. Instead, we'll use a mathematical approach to determine the placement of 2026 on the spiral and then find its neighbors.

A key observation to make is that in the spiral, the bottom-right corner numbers are successive perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...

These squares make up the sequence of odd perfect squares as seen from the spiral pattern:
1 (1x1), 9 (3x3), 25 (5x5), 49 (7x7), and so on.

To find the nearest odd square to 2026, we'll look for the odd square root that is closest but not greater than the square root of 2026:

√2026 ≈ 45.01

Since we want an odd integer, and 45 is odd, we check if 45^2 is greater than or equal to 2026:
45^2 = 2025 which is just below 2026, so 2026 lies on the layer that starts with the square of 45.

We can now determine the position of 2026 relative to the square of its layer: since 2026 is one more than 2025 (45^2), it will be adjacent to 2025 in the spiral.

So 2026 will be positioned as follows relative to the nearest perfect squares in the spiral (which are the bottom right of each layer):

...    ...    ...    ...
... 2025  2026  2027 ...
...    ...    ...    ...

To find the neighbors of 2026, we recall that each layer beyond the first (which starts at 1) in the spiral has two more elements per side than the layer before it. Given that 2026 is in the layer that starts with 2025 (45^2), each side of this layer has 45 elements.

Now, with 2026 lying on the bottom side of the layer, the neighbors of 2026 would be as follows:

2025, the square root layer bottom-right corner
2026, the number whose neighbors we're interested in
2027, the next number in the bottom row
2026 + 45, the number directly above 2026
2025 + 45, the number above 2025
2027 + 45, the number above 2027
2026 - 45, the number directly below 2026 (which is in the previous layer)
2025 - 45, the number below 2025 (which is in the previous layer)
2027 - 45, the number below 2027 (which is in the previous layer since it wraps around)

Let's calculate these:

2025 (bottom-right corner)
+ 2027 (next number in the bottom row)
+ 2026 + 45 = 2071 (above 2026)
+ 2025 + 45 = 2070 (above 2025)
+ 2027 + 45 = 2072 (above 2027)
+ 2026 - 45 = 1981 (below 2026)
+ 2025 - 45 = 1980 (below 2025)
+ 2027 - 45 = 1982 (below 2027)

Now we sum them up:

2025 + 2027 + 2071 + 2070 + 2072 + 1981 + 1980 + 1982 = 16288

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16288.
