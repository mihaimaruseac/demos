To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the number 2026 on the spiral grid.

The spiral grid starts with 1 in the center, and then it grows by spiraling outwards. To determine the neighbors of 2026, we need not find the exact position of 2026, but rather we need to first find the layer or the ring of the spiral in which the number is located and then figure out the numbers adjacent to it.

A square spiral with odd-length sides has a clear pattern: each square layer will have an odd number squared at the bottom-right corner. This is because each time we complete a layer in the spiral, we add a new ring around the previous layer. Let's look at the first few square layers to identify the pattern:

- 1st layer (center): 1 = 1x1 (side length is 1)
- 2nd layer: 9 = 3x3 (side length is 3)
- 3rd layer: 25 = 5x5 (side length is 5)
- 4th layer: 49 = 7x7 (side length is 7)
- etc.

Now we'll look for the square that is just larger than 2026:

1^2 = 1 (too small)
3^2 = 9 (too small)
5^2 = 25 (too small)
...
45^2 = 2025 (barely smaller, hence 2026 is in the next layer)

Since 45^2 = 2025, we know that 2026 is the first number of the next outer layer, which means it's just to the left of the bottom-right corner of that layer.

Now we need the numbers that would be adjacent to 2026. In this next layer, which is the 46th ring (since the center is the 1st ring), the spiral would progress as follows, starting from 2025:

- To the left of 2025 is 2026
- Above 2026, we'd start counting up from 2026 to find the side length of this layer, which will be 2 * 46 - 1 (because we add 1 for the center and then 45 layers on both sides).

So the side length of the spiral is 2 * 46 - 1 = 92 - 1 = 91. Now, since 2026 is the first number on that side and the square is laid out in a counter-clockwise pattern, we know that 2026 is located at the bottom of the vertical leg of the spiral.

Considering the structure of the spiral, we can tell the eight numbers surrounding 2026 are as follows:

- To its immediate left is 2025
- To its immediate right is 2026 + 91 - 1 = 2116 (as we'd go up the entire side, then one left)
- To its immediate bottom is 2026 + 91 = 2117 (as we'd advance to the start of the next "bottom" of the spiral)
- For 2026's other five neighbors, we look diagonally and adjacently up and down the spiral:

- One above and to the left is 2027
- One above is 2027 + 91 - 2 = 2116 (since we'd go to the end, excluding 2026 and 2027)
- Diagonally up and to the right is 2116 - 1 = 2115
- One below and to the left is 2025 - 90 = 1935 (considering the length of the side to be 91 and subtracting one to go "up" one row)
- Diagonally below and to the right is 2117 - 1 = 2116

Let's sum these numbers:

2025 (left) + 2027 (above left) + 2116 (above) + 2115 (above right) + 2116 (right) + 2116 (below right) + 2117 (below) + 1935 (below left)

= 2025 + 2027 + 2116 + 2115 + 2116 + 2116 + 2117 + 1935
= 16,567

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is 16,567.
