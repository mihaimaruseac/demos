To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral, we could either construct a portion of the spiral large enough to include 2026 and manually count the neighbors or try to determine an algorithm or pattern for the numbers surrounding 2026.

Constructing the actual spiral would be inefficient given the number 2026 is relatively large. Instead, let's consider the structure of the spiral and the properties of numbers within it to deduce the neighbors of 2026 without physically constructing the entire grid.

The square spiral has a pattern where perfect squares are located at the bottom right corners as the spiral expands outward. Specifically, odd perfect squares are on the bottom right of the spiral. If we can find the closest odd perfect squares surrounding 2026, we can estimate its location in the grid and determine the numbers surrounding it.

It's clear that \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \) (since \(45^2 = 2025\)), so 2025 is the perfect square just before 2026 and is an odd perfect square. Normally, this would imply that 2025 is on the bottom right, but because 2023 is an odd number, it turns out that 2025 is actually one space to the left of the bottom right. Thus, 2026 is directly to the right of 2025 and is surrounded by numbers that count down by one as we move clockwise starting from 2026, with a little adjustment for the corners.

Given that \(45^2 = 2025\), the side length of the square in which 2025 lies is 45. Now we can quickly determine the neighbors of 2026 based on their relative positions in the grid:

- The number directly above 2026 is 2026 + 45, since we're moving up by one layer in the spiral, which has 45 numbers on a side.
- The number directly below 2026 is 2026 - 45, for the opposite reason.
- The number to the right of 2026 is 2026 + 1.
- The number to the left of 2026 is the square itself, which is 2025.
- The diagonals are incrementally one less than their adjacent cardinal neighbors.

Using this information, here are the neighbors:

To the right of 2026: 2026 + 1 = 2027
To the left of 2026: 2025 (by definition)
Above 2026: 2026 + 45 = 2071
Below 2026: 2026 - 45 = 1981
Above-right diagonal of 2026: 2071 + 1 = 2072
Above-left diagonal of 2026: 2071 - 1 = 2070
Below-right diagonal of 2026: 1981 + 1 = 1982
Below-left diagonal of 2026: 1981 - 1 = 1980

Now we add up these eight numbers to get the sum:

2027 (right) + 2025 (left) + 2071 (above) + 1981 (below) + 2072 (above-right) + 2070 (above-left) + 1982 (below-right) + 1980 (below-left)

= 2027 + 2025 + 2071 + 1981 + 2072 + 2070 + 1982 + 1980
= 16,208

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in this spiral is 16,208.
