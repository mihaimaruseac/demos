To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in this spiral pattern, we must determine where 2026 lies within the grid. This kind of spiral is known as an Ulam spiral or a prime spiral, but it is filled with natural numbers starting from 1 in the center and increasing outward.

The arrangement of the numbers forms concentric square "rings". The bottom right corner of each ring, before the next ring begins, is always an odd square number (1, 9, 25, 49, ...). We can use this property to determine which ring 2026 is in.

Let's find the square root of 2026 to figure out which square "ring" it would fall into:

√2026 ≈ 45.01 (approximately). 

This means that 2026 is just outside the ring that ends with 45^2 = 2025.

Since 2026 is just one number greater than 2025 (which is an odd square), it will be located in the position directly to the right of the bottom-right corner of the square ring that ends with 2025.

To visualize this area of this spiral:

...  2025  2026  ...

Since 2026 is not at a corner or edge of a ring, its 8 neighboring numbers' positions will be:

- Above left: 2023
- Above: 2024 
- Above right: 2027
- Left: 2022 
- Right: 2030
- Below left: 2019 
- Below: 2018
- Below right: 2029

We calculate the sum of these neighbors as follows:

2023 + 2024 + 2027 + 2022 + 2030 + 2019 + 2018 + 2029 = 16192

Thus, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in this spiral pattern is 16192.
