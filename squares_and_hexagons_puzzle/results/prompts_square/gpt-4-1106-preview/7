To solve this problem, we must first understand the pattern of the numbers on the spiral. The spirals increase incrementally outwards with each layer surrounding the initial '1' in the center.

The first layer is the numbers 2 to 9, which forms the first square surrounding the 1. With each subsequent layer, the spiral expands by one unit on each side, and the numbers continue to grow.

Layer 1 (3x3 square): the largest number is 9.
Layer 2 (5x5 square): the largest number is 9 + (5-1)*4 = 9 + 16 = 25.
Layer 3 (7x7 square): the largest number is 25 + (7-1)*4 = 25 + 24 = 49.

The pattern suggests that for a n*n square, the largest number on the square is (n-1)^2 + (n-1)*4.

To find out which layer 2026 falls on, we need to find the smallest odd integer n such that:

(n-1)^2 + (n-1)*4 >= 2026

Let's keep in mind that n must be odd because the spiral pattern starts with a 3x3 square and then goes to 5x5, 7x7, etc., increasing by 2 each time to maintain the square pattern.

Let's denote (n-1) = m, thus m^2 + 4m >= 2026.

We need to find the smallest odd m such that this is true, and then m + 1 will be our odd n corresponding to the layer size.

Instead of algebraically calculating m, let's do the calculation step by step:

Layer 1 (3x3 square): (3-1)^2 + (2)*4 = 4 + 8 = 12 (not large enough)
Layer 2 (5x5 square): (5-1)^2 + (4)*4 = 16 + 16 = 32 (not large enough)
...
We want to find the first m for which m^2 + 4m >= 2026.

\( m^2 + 4m - 2026 >= 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation, and we want to find the smallest m that satisfies this condition. However, for the purpose of this problem, given that it’s a spiral grid, we only need an approximate layer to which the number belongs to find the adjacent numbers.

We can estimate this using iterative calculation or by simplifying the inequality. The exact algebra solution would require using the quadratic formula, which seems unnecessary for this problem. Instead, we can estimate by finding a square number close to 2026 and working from there.

For example, the square root of 2024 (which is close to 2026) is approximately 45, suggesting that 2026 is near the outer edge of a layer with side length around 45 or 47 (since it has to be an odd number). We would then confirm that 45^2 < 2026 < 47^2, and if so, we’d know it falls within the layer that forms a 47x47 grid.

We can do this even without a calculator:

45^2 = 2025 (just under 2026)
47^2 = 2209 (above 2026)

Therefore, 2026 resides just outside the layer with side length 45, on the layer with side length 47. The bottom-right number of a given layer's square is the square of the side length. Hence, 2026 is located just above the bottom-right corner on the 47x47 layer grid.

With the spiral pattern, the numbers increase starting from the center towards the right, then upwards, then to the left, then downwards. Hence, the number directly under 2026 on this layer is 47^2 = 2209.

The neighbors of 2026 will be as follows, assuming x/y going left/up respectively and noting that 2026 is just above 2209:

2209 (below)
2209 - 1 (below left)
2026 - 47 (left)
2026 + 1 (above)
2026 - 1 (below)
2026 + 47 - 1 (above left)
2026 + 47 (above right)
2026 + 47 + 1 (right)

Now let's sum up all these neighbors:

2209 (below)
+ 2208 (below left)
+ 1979 (left, since 2026 - 47 = 1979)
+ 2027 (above)
+ 2025 (below)
+ 2026 + 47 - 1 = 2072 (above left)
+ 2026 + 47 = 2073 (above right)
+ 2026 + 47 + 1 = 2074 (right)

Sum = 2209 + 2208 + 1979 + 2027 + 2025 + 2072 + 2073 + 2074

Sum = 16567

Therefore, the sum of the eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the given spiral is 16567.
