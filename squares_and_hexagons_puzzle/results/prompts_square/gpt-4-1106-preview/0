To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a spiral grid, we need to first understand the pattern of the grid. However, since the grid is too large to manually calculate the neighbors of 2026, we'll make some logical deductions to figure out the pattern around any given number.

The grid given starts like this:

```
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23  24  25
```

As you can see, each complete layer around the center (1) adds an additional ring of numbers. The layers are added in a counterclockwise spiral with the numbers increasing toward the east direction initially, and then turning at the corners.

The lower-right corner numbers of these layers form the series of square numbers: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, and so on (1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, etc.).

Now let's find which layer 2026 falls in. We'll look for the next perfect square that is greater than 2026, and since we know how to calculate successive squares, we can quickly find this:

45^2 = 2025

Therefore, 2026 is just beyond the layer that completes with 45^2. It's in the next layer, starting with 2026, and this layer completes with the square of 46, because 2026 will be right after the bottom right corner of the 45th layer.

46^2 = 2116

Now we need to determine the position of 2026 on that layer. Given that both 2025 and 2026 are near the square of an odd number (45), they will be on the bottom row of the layer (since odd squares form the bottom-right corner and layers start expanding upwards at that point).

Since we're on an outer layer that starts at 2026, we can then deduce the neighbors as follows:

- The right neighbor is simply 2025 (one less).
- The left neighbor will be two more than 2026 since the pattern increases to the left on the bottom row of a layer: 2026 + 2 = 2028.
- The top three and bottom three neighbors require a bit more thought. The difference between each layer's start on the bottom row is 2 times the layer number (since each layer adds two sides to both axes, and we start our count from the number 1 at the center). Therefore:
  - The bottom-middle neighbor of 2026 would be 2025 + 2 * (layer number for 2025), which is 2025 + 2 * 45 = 2025 + 90 = 2115.
  - The other bottom neighbors are one less and one more than this, respectively: 2114 (bottom-left) and 2116 (bottom-right).
  - The top three neighbors can be found in a similar manner but going backwards two layers. So, we go back 2 * (44 + 43), which corresponds to the two previous layers (44 and 43):
    - 2026 - 2 * (44 + 43) = 2026 - 2 * 87 = 2026 - 174 = 1852 (top-middle neighbor)
    - The other two top neighbors would be 1851 (top-left) and 1853 (top-right).

Now we can sum them up:

Right neighbor: 2025
Left neighbor: 2028
Bottom-left neighbor: 2114
Bottom-middle neighbor: 2115
Bottom-right neighbor: 2116
Top-left neighbor: 1851
Top-middle neighbor: 1852
Top-right neighbor: 1853

Sum = 2025 + 2028 + 2114 + 2115 + 2116 + 1851 + 1852 + 1853

Sum = 16004

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral grid is 16,004.
