To solve this problem, we don't actually need to construct the entire grid. We just need to determine the position of 2026 in the grid.

The given spiral grid structure starts with 1 at the center, and the numbers increase as they spiral outward in a counter-clockwise direction. Observe that perfect odd squares (1, 9, 25, 49, ...) are always at the bottom-right corner of their respective square "layers" in the grid.

First, let's find the nearest odd square root before 2026:

√2026 is roughly 45.01, so the largest odd integer not exceeding 45.01 is 45, and 45^2 = 2025.

Therefore, 2025 is the last number on the bottom-right of the layer before reaching 2026, which means 2026 is immediately to the left of 2025 on the grid.

For any perfect square on the bottom right, the numbers surrounding it (at the same distance as 2026 from 2025) contribute to its sum of neighbors as below (using "x" to denote the neighbors and "n" to denote the central number):

x x x
x n x
x x x

For 2026 in particular:

? ? ?
? 25 26
? 24 ?

The sum of the neighbors of 2026 will have a similar pattern to the sum of neighbors of 2025, with two changes: the left neighbor of 2025 (which is 2024) will not be included because it is not a neighbor to 2026, and the top-left neighbor of 2026 (which is 2027) will be included.

The sum of the neighbors of an odd perfect square (e.g., 25) includes:

- All numbers from (n - 3) to (n + 5), where n is the perfect square (because we take three numbers before n, n itself, and then five numbers after n).
- The number (n - (2*sqrt(n) - 1)), which is directly above the perfect square in the grid.

Given this, the sum of the neighbors of 2025 (which is 45^2) would be:

(2025 - 3) + (2025 - 2) + (2025 - 1) + (2025) + (2025 + 1) + (2025 + 2) + (2025 + 3) + (2025 + 4) + (2025 + 5) + (2025 - (2*45 - 1))

2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + (2025 - 89)
2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 1936

If we sum these, we'd get the sum of the neighbors of 2025, including 2025. However, to get the sum of the neighbors of 2026, we need to exclude 2025 and 2024 but include 2027 again:

Sum = (2022 + 2023 + 2026 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 1936 + 2027) - 2025 - 2024

Now calculating the actual sum:

Sum = (2022 + 2023 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 1936 + 2027) + 2026 - 2025 - 2024
Sum = 16148 + 2026 - 4049
Sum = 18174 - 4049
Sum = 14125

So the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 14125.
