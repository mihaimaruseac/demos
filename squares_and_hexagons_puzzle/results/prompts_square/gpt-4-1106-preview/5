To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in a spiral pattern, we first need to determine the location of 2026 in the spiral. We won't write out the entire spiral, but we can use reasoning to figure out where 2026 would land in the pattern. There's a known formula to find the side length of the square in which a given number is located. The formula for the side length (L) of the square containing the number (n) is given by:

L = ceil(sqrt(n))

where ceil() is the ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer, and sqrt() represents the square root. Let's apply this formula to n = 2026:

sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.011

Rounding up to the nearest integer, we get:

L = ceil(45.011) = 45

This means that 2026 lies on the 45th square ring of the spiral. Since 45 is an odd number, the bottom-right number of this square would be 45^2 = 2025; the spiral progresses inward counterclockwise. So, 2026 is one number counterclockwise from the bottom-right corner of its square ring.

Now, let's find the neighbors of 2026:

- As we're on a square grid and since 2026 is not a corner but an edge, 1 is above it on the outer ring and 1 is below it in the inner ring.
- The two horizontal neighbors of 2026 are 2025 to the right and 2027 to the left.
  
As 2026 is just one step counterclockwise from the bottom-right corner, its neighbors above it to the right (above 2025) and below it to the left (below 2027) will be the numbers immediately before and after these, respectively.

- Thus, the neighbor above 2025 on the outer square ring is 2024, since it's moving counterclockwise from the bottom right corner.
- The neighbor below 2027 on the inner square ring will be 2028 since it's moving clockwise due to being on an inner ring.

Finally, the remaining two numbers will be on the diagonal: one diagonal up to the left of 2026 and one diagonal down to the right of 2026. These will be 2023 and 2029, respectively.

Now we simply add the eight neighbors of 2026:
2025 + 2024 + 2023 + (2026 - 1) + (2026 - 45) + (2026 - 45 - 1) + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 

2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2025 + 1981 + 1980 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 16282

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is 16282.
