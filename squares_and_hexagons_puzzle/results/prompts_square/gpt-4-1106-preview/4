To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on a spiral laid out on a square grid, we need to figure out the pattern according to which the numbers are added.

The pattern is an outward spiral starting at 1 in the center, and because of the symmetry in the pattern, numbers that are diagonally across from each other (in relation to the center) increase by an odd number squared. The corners of the square at each "layer" of the spiral are (2n+1)^2 for some integer n, moving counter-clockwise, with the right bottom corner being the largest number in that layer.

By observing the given pattern, we can infer the following:

- Moving vertically or horizontally away from the center (1), each step increases or decreases the number by an odd square number (e.g., 1, 9, 25, 49, ...).
- Moving diagonally away from the center, each step increases or decreases by an odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).

We need to figure out which "layer" the number 2026 is in and then find the numbers adjacent to it. We'll start by finding the square root of 2026, as this would give us an indication of where it might fall on the spiral.

Since the square root of 2026 is between 44 and 45 (because 44^2 = 1936 and 45^2 = 2025), we can deduce that number 2026 is just outside the 45th layer and is part of the 46th layer:

45^2 = 2025
46^2 = 2116

So, 2026 is on the layer that is creating the square of side length 46x46. Since 2025 is the bottom-right corner of the 45x45 layer and the numbers increase counter-clockwise, 2026 is located in the bottom row of the 46x46 layer, just one position to the left of 2025. We can calculate its adjacent numbers based on their positions.

The layout around 2026 (where x represents adjacent numbers) would look like this:

... x x x ...
... x 2026 2025 ...
... x x x ...

We can determine the values of the x's by counting from 2026 moving counter-clockwise:

- To the left of 2026 is 2027.
- Diagonally left and up from 2026 is 2026 + (46 - 1) = 2071.
- Up from 2026 is 2072.
- Up and to the right from 2026 is 2073.
- To the right of 2026 is 2025 (given).
- Diagonally right and down from 2026 is 2024.
- Down from 2026 is 1979 (2025 - (46 - 1) since we move down a layer and then to the left to the previous number).
- Diagonally down and left from 2026 is 1978 (one less than 1979).

Now let's sum up these numbers:

2027 (left) + 2071 (upper left diagonal) + 2072 (above) + 2073 (upper right diagonal) + 2025 (right) + 2024 (lower right diagonal) + 1979 (below) + 1978 (lower left diagonal) = 16,149.

So the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 on the spiral is 16,149.
