Let the square grid be such that the natural numbers are arranged in a spiral. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
The arrangement of the numbers in a spiral is as follows:
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
...

The numbers in the grid can be arranged such that they form a square pattern. Let $n$ be the number. We want to find its position $(x, y)$ in the grid.
We want to find the neighbors of 2026.
First, we need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
We can find the position of a number $n$ in the spiral grid.
The spiral starts with 1 in the center.
We can consider a square grid.
The center is 1, then 2, 3, ...,
Let the number be $n$. Let $k$ be the layer of the spiral that contains $n$. The numbers in the $k$-th layer are from $(2k-1)^2$ to $(2k)^2$.
If $(2k-1)^2 \le n \le (2k)^2$, then $n$ is in layer $k$.
For example, $1 = 1^2$, so $k=1$.
$2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ are $2^2=4, 3^2=9$. $k=2$.
$16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25$ are $4^2=16, 5^2=25$. $k=3$.
Let's find the layer $k$ of 2026.
$(2k-1)^2 \le 2026 \le (2k)^2$
$(2k-1)^2 \le 2026 \Rightarrow 2k-1 \le \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01 \Rightarrow 2k \le 46.01 \Rightarrow k \le 23.005$
$(2k)^2 \ge 2026 \Rightarrow 2k \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01 \Rightarrow k \ge 22.505$
Thus, $k=23$.
Layer 23 contains the numbers from $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ to $(2(23))^2 = 46^2 = 2116$.
Thus, 2026 is the second number in layer 23. The numbers in layer 23 are 2025, 2026, ..., 2116.
If we consider the center as $(0,0)$, then the spiral goes as follows:
1 (0,0)
2 (1,0)
3 (1,1)
4 (0,1)
5 (-1,1)
6 (-1,0)
7 (0,-1)
8 (1,-1)
...
The numbers in layer $k$ form a square with sides of length $2k-1$.
The number 2025 is at the center of layer 23.
The center of layer 23 is 2025.
The position of 2026 is (1,0) relative to 2025.
2025 is at position $(23-1, 23-1) = (22, 22)$ in the grid.
The position of 2026 is $(22, 22) + (1,0) = (23, 22)$.
Neighbors of 2026:
(22, 22) = 2025
(24, 22) = 2027
(23, 21) = 2024
(23, 23) = 2026
(22, 23) = 2025
(24, 23) = 2028
(22, 21) = 2023
(24, 21) = 2026+2 = 2028
(23, 22) = 2025
Neighbors are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2027, 2028.
However, 2026 is one of the neighbors.

The neighbors are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2025, 2027, 2027, 2028. The number 2026 itself is also included.
The neighbors are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2025, 2027, 2027, 2028.
We need to find 8 neighbors.
The neighbors are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028. There are only 5 neighbors.
The neighbors are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2025, 2027, 2027, 2028, 2029.
The sum of neighbors is $2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2025 + 2027 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 = 16208$.
But we are looking for 8 neighbors, not including the number itself.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
