Let the spiral be laid out on a square grid with natural numbers. The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern starting from the center. The given example shows the numbers arranged in a spiral as follows:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
The center number is 1. The numbers spiral outwards in a clockwise direction. The sequence of numbers in the spiral is:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...
The numbers are arranged in layers. The first layer is just the number 1. The second layer is a 3x3 grid containing the numbers 2 to 9. The third layer is a 5x5 grid containing the numbers 10 to 25. The fourth layer is a 7x7 grid containing the numbers 26 to 49, and so on.
The $n$-th layer has side length $2n-1$ and contains the numbers from $(n-1)^2+1$ to $n^2$.
To find the layer containing 2026, we need to find $n$ such that $(n-1)^2+1 \le 2026 \le n^2$.
$(n-1)^2 \le 2025 \le n^2$
$n-1 \le \sqrt{2025} \le n$
$n-1 \le 45 \le n$
So, $n = 46$.
Then $n^2 = 46^2 = 2116$.
$(n-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
The numbers in the 46th layer are from $45^2+1 = 2026$ to $46^2 = 2116$.
The number 2026 is in the $46$-th layer, so it is the first number in the layer.
Let's denote the coordinates of the number 2026 as $(x,y)$. In the spiral, the center number 1 is at coordinates $(0,0)$. The $n$-th layer has side length $2n-1$. The coordinates of the numbers in the $n$-th layer are from $-(n-1)$ to $n-1$.
The 46th layer has side length $2(46)-1 = 91$.
The coordinates of the numbers in the 46th layer are from $-45$ to 45.
The number 2026 is in the 46th layer, and it is the first number in the layer, so its coordinates are $(0,0)$. However, this is not correct, since the center is 1, not 2026.
Let's consider the coordinates of the number $n$. The coordinates $(x,y)$ of the number $n$ can be found using the formula:
$x = 0, y = 0$ for $n = 1$.
We need to find the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral grid. Since $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 is the first number in the 46th layer. The center is $(0,0)$.
The number 2026 is at the corner of the 46th layer. The corner is at $(45,45)$ if we consider the coordinates starting from 1. But we need to find the coordinate of 2026.
Since 2026 is the first number in the 46th layer, its coordinates are $(45,45)$. The coordinates are given by $x = y = n-1 = 45$.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers to the left, right, above, and below it.
In the spiral grid, the neighbors of $(x,y)$ are $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x, y-1)$, $(x, y+1)$.
The coordinates of 2026 are $(45, 45)$. The neighbors are:
$(44, 45), (46, 45), (45, 44), (45, 46)$
However, these numbers might be outside the grid.
We need to find the numbers in the 46th layer. They range from 2026 to 2116.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
$2025, 2027, \text{corner}, \text{corner}$
2025 is in the 45th layer. 2027 is also in the 46th layer.

Let $n=46$. The first number is $45^2+1 = 2026$. The numbers are arranged in layers.
2026 has coordinates $(45, 45)$ with respect to the center.
The number to the left is $2025 = 45^2$.
The number to the right is $2027$.
The number below is 2027.
The number above is $45^2 = 2025$.

We are looking for the sum of 8 neighbors of 2026.
The eight neighbors are the four direct neighbors and the four diagonal neighbors.
The neighbors are $2025, 2027, 2026+1, 2026-1, 2026+n, 2026-n$
2026: $45^2 + 1$
The 8 neighbors are $2025, 2027, 2026-45, 2026+45, 2026-1, 2026+1$.
$2025, 2027, 1981, 2111, 2025, 2027$
Let's find the coordinates of the numbers. 2026 is $(0,0)$ in the 46th layer.
Neighbors are $2025, 2027, 1981, 2111$. The sum is $2025+2027+1981+2111 = 8144$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16168}$
