Let the position of the number 2026 in the spiral be $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the row and column coordinates. The spiral is laid out on a square grid, so the natural numbers are written in a spiral. The spiral starts with 1 in the center, then expands outwards in a spiral pattern.

The numbers are arranged in the spiral as follows:
1
6 7
5 4 3
8 9 10 11
...

We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
First, let's find the position of 2026 in the spiral. We know that the numbers are arranged in order. The sequence of numbers in the spiral is
$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...$
We can find the position of 2026 in the spiral by finding a layer containing 2026.
The numbers in each layer are consecutive.
The numbers from 1 to $n^2$ form a square. The number of layers is roughly $\sqrt{n}$.
In general, the numbers in the $k$-th layer form a square with side length $2k-1$. The minimum number in this layer is $(2k-3)^2+1$ and the maximum number is $(2k-1)^2$.
We want to find the layer $k$ such that $(2k-3)^2 < 2026 \le (2k-1)^2$.
$(2k-3)^2 < 2026$
$2k-3 < \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$
$2k < 48.01$
$k < 24.005$
$(2k-1)^2 \ge 2026$
$2k-1 \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$
$2k \ge 46.01$
$k \ge 23.005$
Thus, $k=24$.

We can also calculate the side length of the layer containing 2026. The side length is $2k-1 = 2(24)-1 = 47$. The minimum number in the layer is $(2(24)-3)^2+1 = (48-3)^2+1 = 45^2+1 = 2025+1 = 2026$. Since 2026 is the minimum number in this layer, it is located at the corner of the layer.
The coordinates of 2026 are $(24, 24)$ with respect to the center.
The coordinates of the corner cell with 2026 is $(23,23)$, assuming the center cell is $(0,0)$.
The coordinates in the grid are (row, column).
In our case, we have the side length of the square grid is $47$. The position of the center is $47/2=23.5$.
The position of 2026 is $(24, 24)$ with respect to the center cell.
So the coordinates of the cell with 2026 are $(24, 24)$. The coordinates of the center cell are $(23.5, 23.5)$.

In the spiral, 2026 is at the corner of a square. The corners of the square are the positions of the numbers $2025, 2026, 2027, 2028$.
Let the grid be $n \times n$, where $n$ is the side length of the grid.
The spiral goes as follows:
$$ \begin{array}{ccccc}
a & b & c & d \\
e & f & g & h \\
i & j & k & l \\
m & n & o & p
\end{array} $$
The neighbors of $k$ are $b, d, e, h, i, l, m, n$.
The neighbors of $k$ are $b, d, e, h, i, l, m, n$.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029, 2020, 2030.
The sum of the neighbors is $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2020 + 2030 = 16206$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16206}$
