Let the square grid be indexed by coordinates $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers.
We are given a spiral arrangement of natural numbers. Let $n$ be a natural number. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of $n=2026$.
We need to find the coordinates $(x, y)$ of 2026 in the spiral.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, starting from the center.
The center number is 1.
The next layer contains the numbers 2 to 9.
The next layer contains the numbers 10 to 16.
The next layer contains the numbers 17 to 24.
In general, the layer $k$ contains the numbers from $(2k-1)^2$ to $(2k)^2$.
We want to find the layer that contains 2026.
We have $(2k-1)^2 \le 2026 \le (2k)^2$.
We need to find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 \le 2026 \le (2k)^2$.
Taking the square root, we have $2k-1 \le \sqrt{2026} \le 2k$.
Since $\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$, we have $2k-1 \le 45.01 \le 2k$.
From $2k-1 \le 45.01$, we have $2k \le 46.01$, so $k \le 23.005$.
From $45.01 \le 2k$, we have $k \ge 22.505$.
Thus, $k=23$.
The layer number is $k=23$.
The numbers in layer $k=23$ are from $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$ to $(2(23))^2 = 46^2 = 2116$.
So 2026 is not in this layer.
The layer number is $k=23$. The layer contains the numbers 2025 to 2116. The number 2026 is in the next layer.
The numbers are written as follows:
1 is at (0,0)
2 is at (0,1)
3 is at (1,1)
4 is at (0,2)
5 is at (1,2)
6 is at (2,2)
7 is at (1,3)
8 is at (2,3)
9 is at (3,3)
Let $(x_n, y_n)$ be the coordinates of $n$.
We can find the coordinates of 2026.
We know that $45^2 = 2025$. So 2025 is at layer 23.
Layer 23 has corners at $(-22, -22), (-22, 22), (22, 22), (22, -22)$.
The coordinates of 2025 are $(-22, -22)$ translated by the spiral.
The coordinates of 1 are (0,0).
The coordinates of 2025 are found by moving from (0,0) to $(x, y)$ by going in a spiral.
Since $2025 = 45^2$, the number 2025 is at $(-22, -22)$.
So $n = 2026$ is the number to the right of 2025, which is at $(-21, -22)$.
The neighbors of $n$ are the 8 numbers surrounding $n$.
For $n=2026$, the coordinates are $(-21, -22)$.
The neighbors are at $(-22, -22)$, $(-22, -23)$, $(-22, -21)$, $(-20, -21)$, $(-21, -21)$, $(-21, -23)$, $(-20, -22)$, $(-22, -21)$.
The numbers are at these locations.
We have 2025 at $(-22, -22)$.
Then 2026 is at $(-21, -22)$.
The 8 neighbors are at coordinates
$(-22, -22), (-22, -23), (-22, -21), (-21, -21), (-21, -23), (-20, -21), (-20, -23), (-20, -22)$.
The numbers at these coordinates are:
$2025, 2027, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2019, 2020$.
The sum of the neighbors is $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2019 + 2020 = 16199 + 20 = 16199 - 1 = 16191$.
Then $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2019 + 2020 = 16201$.
Alternatively, the numbers are
2025, 2027, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2019, 2020
The sum is $2026 \times 8 - (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8) = 8 \times 2026 - \frac{8(9)}{2} = 16208 - 36 = 16172$.
$S = 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2019 + 2020 = (2026-1) + (2026+1) + (2026-2) + (2026-3) + (2026-4) + (2026-5) + (2026-7) + (2026-6) = 8(2026) - (1+2+3+4+5+6+7) = 16208 - (1+2+3+4+5+6+7) = 16208 - 28 = 16180$.
Neighbors: 2025, 2027, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2019, 2020
Sum: 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2023 + 2022 + 2021 + 2019 + 2020 = 16191

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16191}$
