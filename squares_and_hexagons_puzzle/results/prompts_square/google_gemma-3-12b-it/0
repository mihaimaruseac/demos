Let the given spiral be as follows:
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid.
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let $n$ be the number 2026.
The numbers in the spiral are placed in increasing order, spiraling outwards from the center.
The center of the spiral is 1. The next layer is 2-7, the next layer is 8-12, the next layer is 13-18, and so on.
The spiral pattern can be written as follows:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
... 12 11 10 ...
... 13 14 15 ...
We want to find the neighbors of 2026. We need to find the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral grid.
Let's denote the position of a number $n$ in the spiral as $(x,y)$, where $(0,0)$ is the center (1).
The numbers are arranged in layers. The number of cells in each layer increases by 8.
The first layer has 1 cell: 1.
The second layer has $4$ cells: 2, 3, 4, 5.
The third layer has $8$ cells: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
The fourth layer has $12$ cells: 14, ..., 25.
The $k$-th layer has $4(k-1)$ cells for $k \ge 2$.
To find the layer that 2026 is in, we need to find the number of layers until we reach 2026.
The number of cells in the first $k-1$ layers is $1 + 4(1) + 4(2) + \cdots + 4(k-2) = 1 + 4\sum_{i=1}^{k-2} i = 1 + 4\frac{(k-2)(k-1)}{2} = 1 + 2(k-2)(k-1) = 1 + 2(k^2 - 3k + 2) = 1 + 2k^2 - 6k + 4 = 2k^2 - 6k + 5$.
We want to find $k$ such that $2k^2 - 6k + 5 \le 2026 < 2(k+1)^2 - 6(k+1) + 5$.
$2k^2 - 6k + 5 \le 2026 \implies 2k^2 - 6k - 2021 \le 0$.
$2(k+1)^2 - 6(k+1) + 5 > 2026 \implies 2(k^2 + 2k + 1) - 6k - 6 + 5 > 2026 \implies 2k^2 + 4k + 2 - 6k - 1 > 2026 \implies 2k^2 - 2k + 1 > 2026 \implies 2k^2 - 2k - 2025 > 0$.
Solving $2k^2 - 6k - 2021 = 0$: $k = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4(2)(-2021)}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 16168}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{16204}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm 127.29}{4}$.
$k \approx \frac{6 + 127.29}{4} \approx \frac{133.29}{4} \approx 33.32$.
Solving $2k^2 - 2k - 2025 = 0$: $k = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4(2)(-2025)}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16200}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16204}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm 127.29}{4}$.
$k \approx \frac{2 + 127.29}{4} \approx \frac{129.29}{4} \approx 32.32$.
Thus, $k = 33$.
The number of cells in the first $32$ layers is $2(32^2) - 6(32) + 5 = 2(1024) - 192 + 5 = 2048 - 192 + 5 = 1861$.
The number of cells in the first $33$ layers is $2(33^2) - 6(33) + 5 = 2(1089) - 198 + 5 = 2178 - 198 + 5 = 1985$.
Since 2026 is in the 33rd layer, we can say that $1861 < 2026 \le 1985$.
The position of 2026 in the layer is $2026 - 1861 = 165$. The length of the layer is $4(33-1) = 4(32) = 128$.
The position of 2026 within the 33rd layer is $2026 - 1861 = 165$.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029, 2022, 2030.
Sum of neighbors = $2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2022 + 2030 = 16198$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16198}$
