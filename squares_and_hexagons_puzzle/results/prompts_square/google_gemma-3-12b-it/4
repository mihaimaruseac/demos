Let $n$ be the number we are interested in, which is 2026. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026. The neighbors of $n$ are the numbers immediately above, below, left, and right of $n$, as well as the four diagonal numbers.

We need to find the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral. Let $N$ be the number such that $N$ is the largest perfect square less than or equal to $n$. Then we can find the row and column coordinates of $n$ in the spiral.
For $n=2026$, we have $44^2 = 1936 < 2026 < 45^2 = 2025$.
This is incorrect, since 2025 is a number on the spiral.
We have $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$. Since $2026$ is not a perfect square, we have that 2025 is one of the corner numbers.
Consider the spiral. Let $k$ be the layer of the spiral in which $n$ lies. Then $k^2$ is the value in the center of the spiral.
Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, 2026 lies in the layer after 45.
We have $45^2 = 2025$, so we need to find where 2026 is located.
The numbers in the spiral are arranged in layers. The spiral starts at the center, which is 1. The next layer is a $3 \times 3$ square, with the center number being 5. The next layer is a $5 \times 5$ square, with the center number being 13.
The center number of the $k$-th layer is $(2k-1)^2$.
The location of $n$ in the spiral can be found by considering the values of $k$.
The $k$-th layer has side length $2k-1$. The numbers in the $k$-th layer are the numbers between $(k-1)^2$ and $k^2$.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, $2026$ is the first number in the next layer.
The next layer has side length $2(46)-1 = 91$. The center is $46^2 = 2116$.
The coordinates of $2025$ are $(0,0)$ in the layer with side length 45.
$2026$ is to the right of $2025$, so the coordinates of $2026$ are $(1,0)$ in the layer with side length 45.
The numbers to the right of 2025 are $2026, 2027, \ldots, 2025 + 91 = 2116$.
However, we need the coordinates in the larger grid.
Since $2025 = 45^2$, we are in the $45$-th layer. The coordinates of $2025$ are $(-22, -22)$. The coordinates of 2026 are $(-22+1, -22) = (-21, -22)$.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
Up: $(-21, -21)$
Down: $(-21, -23)$
Left: $(-22, -22)$
Right: $(-20, -22)$
Diagonal Up-Right: $(-20, -21)$
Diagonal Up-Left: $(-22, -21)$
Diagonal Down-Right: $(-20, -23)$
Diagonal Down-Left: $(-22, -23)$
We need to find the values of these neighbors.
The numbers in the $45$-th layer are $44^2 = 1936, \ldots, 45^2 = 2025$.
The numbers in the $46$-th layer are $45^2+1 = 2026, \ldots, 46^2 = 2116$.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
Up: $2025-44 = 1981$
Down: $2025+44 = 2069$
Left: $2025-1 = 2024$
Right: $2025+1 = 2027$
Diagonal Up-Right: $2025-1+44 = 2068$
Diagonal Up-Left: $2025-1-44 = 1980$
Diagonal Down-Right: $2025+1+44 = 2070$
Diagonal Down-Left: $2025+1-44 = 1982$
The sum of these neighbors is $1981+2069+2024+2027+2068+1980+2070+1982 = 15101$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{15101}$
