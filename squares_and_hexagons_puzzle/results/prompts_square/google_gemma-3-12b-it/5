Let the number 2026 be located at coordinates $(x, y)$ in the square grid.
We are given a spiral layout of natural numbers, which starts with 1 in the center, then spirals outwards.
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are the numbers above, below, to the left, and to the right of 2026, as well as the four diagonal numbers.
We can observe the following pattern in the spiral:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
...

Let $n = 2026$. We want to find the coordinates of $n$ in the spiral.
The spiral starts with 1 at the center.
The number of integers in a $k \times k$ grid centered at 1 is $k^2$.
The largest $k$ such that $k^2 \le 2026$ is $k = \lfloor \sqrt{2026} \rfloor = 44$.
The number of integers in a $44 \times 44$ grid is $44^2 = 1936$.
The number of integers remaining is $2026 - 1936 = 90$.
The $44 \times 44$ grid is centered at 1. We want to find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
We are considering the integers arranged in a spiral. The $n$-th integer in the spiral is $n$.
To find the position of $n$, we can determine the largest square containing $n$.
The largest integer $k$ such that $k^2 \le n$ is $k = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$.
For $n = 2026$, we have $k = \lfloor \sqrt{2026} \rfloor = 44$.
The center of the spiral is $(0, 0)$. We consider the integers in the order
$1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$
We have $k = 44$. The grid is $44 \times 44$, centered at $(0, 0)$. The integers are arranged as follows:
$1$ in the center, then $2, 3, \dots$ spiral outwards.
The number of integers in the square with side length $2k+1$ is $(2k+1)^2$.
The number of integers in the square with side length $2k-1$ is $(2k-1)^2$.
We have $n = 2026$, so we are looking for the position of 2026 in the spiral. We have $44^2 = 1936 < 2026 < 2025 = 45^2$.
The number 2026 is in the fourth ring outside the $44 \times 44$ grid.
In the spiral, the number $n$ is at position $(x, y)$ such that $n = x^2 + y^2 + 1$ (approximately).
Let $n = 2026$. We want to find the coordinates $(x, y)$ of 2026.
We have $2026 - 1 = 2025 = 45^2$.
We want to find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
Let $k = 44$. Then $44^2 = 1936$. The position of 1936 is $(0, 0)$ in the $44 \times 44$ grid.
We have $2026 = 1936 + 90$.
We need to find the coordinates of 90 in the spiral. The spiral starts at 1.
Consider the spiral as layers around the center 1.
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3
Layer 3: 4, 5, 6, 7
Layer 4: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Layer $k$: $8(k-1) + 1$ to $8k$ (approximately)
We have $2026 \approx 8k$, so $k \approx 253$.
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
Let $N(n)$ be the neighbors of $n$.
$N(n) = n-1, n+1, n-k, n+k, n-i, n+i$, where $i, k$ are some values.
$2026-1 = 2025$, $2026+1 = 2027$.
We have the number 2026.
The number to the left is 2025.
The number to the right is 2027.
The number above is 2020.
The number below is 2032.
The neighbors are $2025, 2027, 2020, 2032, 2024, 2028, 2016, 2036$.
The sum is $2025+2027+2020+2032+2024+2028+2016+2036 = 16198$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16198}$
