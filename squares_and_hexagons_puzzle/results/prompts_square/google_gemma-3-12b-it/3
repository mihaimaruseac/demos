Let the number 2026 be in the grid. We want to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

First, let's consider the positions of the natural numbers in the spiral grid.
1 is at the center. The first ring contains the numbers from 2 to 9. The second ring contains the numbers from 10 to 17.
The grid is arranged such that the center is 1. The numbers increase in a spiral pattern.
Let $n$ be a natural number. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of $n = 2026$.
We can find the neighbors of $n$ by looking at the grid. The neighbors are the numbers to the north, south, east, and west of $n$. The diagonal neighbors are also considered.
The neighbors are the numbers in the 8 adjacent cells.
Let $n$ be the number. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of $n$. Let the neighbors be $n_1, n_2, ..., n_8$.
We want to find $\sum_{i=1}^8 n_i$.

Let's consider the ring $r$ that contains the number $n$.
The number of elements in the ring $r$ is $8(r-1)$.
If $n$ is in ring $r$, then $n$ is in the interval $[8(r-1)+1, 8r]$.
For $n=2026$, we have $8(r-1) < 2026 \le 8r$.
$8(r-1) < 2026 \implies r-1 < \frac{2026}{8} = 253.25 \implies r-1 \le 253 \implies r \le 254$
$2026 \le 8r \implies \frac{2026}{8} \le r \implies 253.25 \le r \implies r \ge 254$
Thus $r = 254$.

The starting number in the 254th ring is $8(254-1)+1 = 8(253)+1 = 2024+1 = 2025$.
Since $2025 \le 2026 \le 8(254) = 2032$, the number 2026 is in the 254th ring.

The number 2026 is in the 254th ring. The starting number in the 254th ring is 2025.
The numbers in the 254th ring are 2025, 2026, 2027, ..., 2032.
Let's find the coordinates of the number 2026.
Let $(x,y)$ be the coordinates of the number 2026, where the center (1) is at $(0,0)$.
Since $n$ is in ring $r$, we have $n = r^2 + (r-1)^2 + 1 - r(r-1)$.
If $n=2026$, we want to find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
We know that $n = 2026$ is in ring $r = 254$.
We have $2026 = 2025 + 1$. The numbers are arranged in a spiral, so the position of $n$ in the ring depends on the direction. The spiral goes right, down, left, up.

We can find the neighbors using the formula.
$n_1 = 2026-1 = 2025$
$n_2 = 2026+1 = 2027$
$n_3 = 2026+8 = 2034$
$n_4 = 2026-8 = 2018$
The neighbors are $2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032$.

We have $n_1 = n-1, n_2 = n+1, n_3 = n+8, n_4 = n-8$.
The other neighbors are $n+1-8 = n-7, n+1+8 = n+9, n-1-8 = n-9, n-1+8 = n+7$.
So the neighbors are $n-9, n-8, n-7, n-1, n+1, n+7, n+8, n+9$.
Their sum is $8n$.
The sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is $2026-9 + 2026-8 + 2026-7 + 2026-1 + 2026+1 + 2026+7 + 2026+8 + 2026+9 = 8 \cdot 2026 = 16208$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
