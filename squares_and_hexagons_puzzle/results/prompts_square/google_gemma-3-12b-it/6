Let the spiral grid be arranged as follows:
$$
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
& & & 5 & 4 & 3 & & \\
& & 6 & 1 & 2 & 7 & & \\
& 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 10 & \\
11 & 10 & 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 11 & \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots
\end{array}
$$
The natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. We want to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
The spiral starts with 1 in the center. The numbers increase in order outwards. The numbers are arranged in a square spiral.

Let $n$ be the number. We want to find the neighbors of $n = 2026$.
The neighbors are the numbers directly above, below, left, and right of $n$, as well as the four diagonal neighbors.
We need to find the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral grid.

The numbers in the spiral are arranged in layers. The number of integers in the $k$-th layer (centered at 1) is $8(k-1)$.
The largest number in the $k$-th layer is $1 + 8(k-1) = 8k-7$.
We want to find $k$ such that $8k-7 \ge 2026$.
$8k \ge 2033$
$k \ge \frac{2033}{8} = 254.125$
So $k = 255$.
The largest number in the 255-th layer is $8(255)-7 = 2040-7 = 2033$.
Since $2026 < 2033$, the number 2026 is in the 255-th layer.
The first number in the 255-th layer is $8(254)-7 = 2032-7 = 2025$.
Thus, $2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033$ are the numbers in the 255-th layer.
2026 is the second number in the 255-th layer.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2033, and the numbers just outside the 255-th layer.
The numbers in the 254-th layer are from $8(253)-7 = 2024-7 = 2017$ to $2024$.
The numbers in the 256-th layer are from $8(256)-7 = 2048-7 = 2041$ to $2056$.
The number above 2026 is 2025.
The number below 2026 is 2027.
The number to the left of 2026 is 2025.
The number to the right of 2026 is 2027.
The top-left neighbor is not well-defined.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025 (left), 2027 (right), 2025 (above), 2027 (below).

Consider the coordinates of 2026.
The number 1 is at the center $(0, 0)$. The layer $k$ has side length $2k-1$.
The first number in layer $k$ is $1 + 8(k-1) = 8k-7$.
Since $8k-7 = 2026$, we have $8k = 2033$, so $k = \frac{2033}{8} = 254.125$. Thus, the number 2026 is in layer 255.
We have the grid.
The numbers around 2026 are:
2025
2027
2033
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2033, ...
However, we need the 8 neighbors.

Sum of neighbors is $2025+2027+2033+2026-2025 = 2025+2027+2033+2028$.
The 8 neighbors are 2025, 2027, 2033, ...

Let's look at the number 8. Neighbors are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.
We want to sum the 8 neighbors of 2026.
The neighbors are: 2025, 2027, 2033.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16196}$
