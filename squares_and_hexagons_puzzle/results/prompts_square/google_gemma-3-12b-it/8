Let $S$ be the square grid in which the natural numbers are written in a spiral pattern. The spiral starts from the center of the grid, which is the number 1. The numbers are written in a clockwise spiral.
The grid is
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
... ... ...
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

First, let's find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
Let $n$ be the number. We want to find the position of $n$ in the spiral.
We know that the center is 1. Let the side length of the square in which 1 is located be $2k+1$. Then the numbers from $1$ to $(2k+1)^2$ are arranged in the square grid. The center number is $1$.
If $n = 2026$, we want to find the side length of the square containing $2026$.
The numbers are arranged in layers. The $k$-th layer consists of the numbers from $(2(k-1)+1)^2$ to $(2k+1)^2$.
Let $m = 2k+1$. Then $n$ is in the square grid with side length $m$.
Let $L$ be the layer number containing $2026$. Then $(2(L-1)+1)^2 < 2026 \le (2L+1)^2$.
$(2L-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2L+1)^2$.
We have $(2L-1)^2 < 2026$, so $2L-1 < \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$.
Also, $2026 \le (2L+1)^2$, so $\sqrt{2026} \le 2L+1$, so $45.01 \le 2L+1$, so $44.01 \le 2L$, so $22.005 \le L$.
Therefore, $L = 23$.
Let $L=23$. Then $(2(23)-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 < 2026$ and $(2(23)+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 > 2026$.
Thus, $2026$ is in the layer with side length $47$.
The center is $1$, and the number $2025$ is in the center of the $23$-rd layer. Thus, $2026$ is the first number in the next spiral layer.
The coordinates of $1$ are $(0, 0)$. The coordinates of $2025$ are $(22, 22)$. The coordinates of $2026$ are $(22, 23)$.

The coordinates of 2026 are $(22, 23)$. The number 1 is at $(0, 0)$.
Let the coordinate of the number $n$ be $(x, y)$. Then the numbers around $2026$ are:
$2025$ at $(22, 22)$
$2027$ at $(22, 24)$
$2024$ at $(21, 23)$
$2028$ at $(23, 24)$
$2023$ at $(21, 22)$
$2029$ at $(23, 22)$
$2022$ at $(21, 21)$
$2030$ at $(23, 23)$
However, we need to find the neighbors of 2026, so we need to find the coordinates of the neighbors.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers in the cells adjacent to the cell containing 2026.
The neighbors of $n=2026$ are:
$n-1=2025$, $n+1=2027$, $n-2026-1 = 2023$, $n+2026+1 = 2029$,
$n-2026-45 = 2022$, $n+2026+45 = 2030$
The neighbors of $n$ are $n-1, n+1, n-10, n+10, \dots$

Let $x$ be the row and $y$ be the column. The position of 2026 is $2026$. We are in the $23$rd layer. The number in the $23$rd layer is $2025$ to $2209$.
Then $n=2026$ is the number that is to the right of $2025$. So $n=2026$ is at $(22, 23)$.
Then the neighbors are:
$2025$ at $(22, 22)$
$2027$ at $(22, 24)$
$2024$ at $(21, 23)$
$2028$ at $(23, 24)$
$2023$ at $(21, 22)$
$2029$ at $(23, 22)$
$2022$ at $(21, 21)$
$2030$ at $(23, 23)$
The sum of the neighbors is $2025+2027+2024+2028+2023+2029+2022+2030 = 16228$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16228}$
