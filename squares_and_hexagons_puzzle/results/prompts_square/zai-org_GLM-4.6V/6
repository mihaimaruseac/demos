To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of the number 2026 in the Ulam spiral, then find the values of its eight neighbors, and sum them.

### Step 1: Find the layer (square) that contains 2026.
The numbers in the Ulam spiral are arranged in concentric squares (layers) with side length \( L = 2k + 1 \) for layer \( k \). The numbers in layer \( k \) range from \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 \) to \( (2k+1)^2 \).

For \( N = 2026 \), we find \( k \) such that \( (2k-1)^2 < N \leq (2k+1)^2 \). Solving \( (2k-1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2k+1)^2 \) gives \( k = 23 \) (since \( 45^2 = 2025 < 2026 \) and \( 47^2 = 2209 \geq 2026)). Thus, 2026 is in the square of side length \( L = 2 \times 23 - 1 = 45 \) (since the square for layer \( k \) has side length \( 2k+1 \), so for \( k = 23 \), \( L = 2 \times 23 - 1 = 45 \). The coordinates of the bottom-right corner of this square are \( (k, -k) = (23, -23) \) with value \( (2k+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \).

### Step 2: Determine the coordinates of 2026.
The number 2026 is the first number in the perimeter of the square for layer \( k = 23 \). The perimeter of the square is traversed in a specific order: starting at the bottom-right corner (value \( (2k+1)^2 = 2209 \)), moving up along the right side, then left along the top side, then down along the left side, and finally right along the bottom side back to the bottom-right corner.

The number 2026 is the first number in the perimeter, which corresponds to the position one step up from the bottom-right corner along the right side. For \( k = 23 \), the bottom-right corner is at \( (k, -k) = (23, -23) \) with value 2209. Moving up by 1 step along the right side gives the position \( (k, -k + 1) = (23, -22) \) with value \( 2209 - 1 = 2208 \). However, our N = 2026 is less than 2208, so it must be in a different layer. Wait, we found \( k = 23 \), but the value at the bottom-right corner is 2209, and moving up by 1 step gives 2208. But 2026 is less than 2208, so it must be in the layer for \( k = 22 \) (since \( 45^2 = 2025 \) is the last number of layer \( k = 22 \), and the first number of layer \( k = 22 \) is \( (2k-1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026. So 2026 is the first number in the perimeter of the square for layer \( k = 22 \) (side length \( L = 2k+1 = 45 \)). The bottom-right corner of this square is at \( (k, -k) = (22, -22) \) with value \( (2k+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \). The perimeter is traversed starting from the bottom-right corner, moving up, left, down, and right back to the bottom-right corner. The first number in the perimeter is at the position one step up from the bottom-right corner along the right side. For layer \( k = 22 \), the bottom-right corner is at \( (22, -22) \) with value 2025. Moving up by 1 step along the right side gives the position \( (22, -21) \) with value 2024. But 2026 is greater than 2024, so it must be in the next layer (k=23). For k=23, the bottom-right corner is at (23, -23) with value 47^2 = 2209. Moving up by 1 step along the right side gives the position (23, -22) with value 2208. But 2026 is less than 2208, so it must be in the layer k=22 (side length L=45), bottom-right corner at (22, -22) with value 45^2 = 2025. Then, moving up by 1 step along the right side gives the position (22, -21) with value 2024. But 2026 is greater than 2024, so it must be in the next layer (k=23). For k=23, the bottom-right corner is at (23, -23) with value 47^2 = 2209. Moving up by 1 step along the right side gives the position (23, -22) with value 2208.
