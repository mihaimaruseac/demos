Place 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), etc. Then (2k+1)^2 sits at (k,-k). Since 45^2 = 2025 = (2·22+1)^2, 2025 is at (22,-22) and therefore 2026 is at (23,-22).

The eight neighbouring coordinates of (23,-22) are
(23,-21), (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23),
(23,-23), (22,-23), (22,-22), (22,-21).

Compute values by using that for ring r the first number is (2r-1)^2+1 at (r,-(r-1)), and values increase by 1 going up along x=r:

- (23,-21): ring 23, value = 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (24,-21): ring 24, s24 = 47^2+1 = 2209+1 = 2210, value = 2210 + 2 = 2212
- (24,-22): ring 24, value = 2210 + 1 = 2211
- (24,-23): ring 24, value = 2210
- (23,-23): ring 23 bottom-right corner = 47^2 = 2209
- (22,-23): ring 23 bottom edge, value = 2209 − 1 = 2208
- (22,-22): = 45^2 = 2025
- (22,-21): ring 22 start s22 = 43^2+1 = 1849+1 = 1850

Sum = 2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2209 + 2208 + 2025 + 1850 = 16952.

Answer: 16952.
