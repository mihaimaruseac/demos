Put 1 at (0,0), x to the right, y up. Then 2026 = 2025+1 lies on the ring m = 23 at (23,−22). Its 8 neighbors are the grid points

(22,−23), (23,−23), (24,−23),
(22,−22),        (24,−22),
(22,−21), (23,−21), (24,−21).

Use ring formulas: for ring m the first number is S_m = (2m−1)^2+1 and the max is N_m = (2m+1)^2. Thus
S_23 = 2026, N_23 = 2209, S_24 = 2210, N_22 = 2025, S_22 = 1850.

Evaluating each neighbor:
(22,−23) = N_23 − (23−22) = 2208
(23,−23) = N_23 = 2209
(24,−23) = S_24 = 2210
(22,−22) = N_22 = 2025
(24,−22) = S_24 + 1 = 2211
(22,−21) = S_22 = 1850
(23,−21) = S_23 + 1 = 2027
(24,−21) = S_24 + 2 = 2212

Sum = 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.

Answer: 16952.
