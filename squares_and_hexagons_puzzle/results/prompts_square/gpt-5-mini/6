Answer: 16952

Sketch of solution. Let coordinates (x,y) with 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), etc. For n>1 the layer k is given by (2k-1)^2 < n ≤ (2k+1)^2; the maximum on layer k is m = (2k+1)^2 at (k,-k). For a point with L = max(|x|,|y|), s = 2L+1 and m = s^2, the distance d along the perimeter from the bottom-right corner (moving counterclockwise) is
- if y = −L: d = L − x
- if x = −L: d = (s−1) + (y + L)
- if y = L: d = 2(s−1) + (x + L)
- if x = L: d = 3(s−1) + (L − y)
and the number at (x,y) is n = m − d.

2026 lies in layer k = 23 at (23,−22). The eight neighbors and their values are:
(22,−23)=2208, (23,−23)=2209, (24,−23)=2210,
(22,−22)=2025,         (24,−22)=2211,
(22,−21)=1850, (23,−21)=2027, (24,−21)=2212.

Their sum is 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
