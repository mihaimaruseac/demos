Put 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0) and follow the given anticlockwise spiral. The bottom‑right corner of ring R has value (2R+1)^2 at (R,−R). Since 45^2 = 2025, 2026 = 45^2+1 is the first entry of the next ring R = 23, so

2026 is at (23,−22).

The eight neighbours are at
(22,−23)=2208,
(23,−23)=2209,
(24,−23)=2210,
(22,−22)=2025,
(24,−22)=2211,
(22,−21)=1850,
(23,−21)=2027,
(24,−21)=2212.

Summing them gives 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
