Put 1 at (0,0) and use coordinates (x,y) with +x to the right, +y up. The odd square m^2 lies at the bottom-right corner (r,-r) with r=(m-1)/2. For n = 2026 we have 47^2 = 2209 > 2026 and 45^2 = 2025 < 2026, so r = 23, m = 47, and the offset from the bottom-right is s = 2209 − 2026 = 183. Along the perimeter s = 183 lies on the right side (k = floor(s/(m−1)) = 3) with t = s mod (m−1) = 45, so the coordinate of 2026 is (23, −22).

Compute the eight neighbors (x,y) around (23,−22) and their values by the standard formula: for a cell with radius R = max(|x|,|y|), m = 2R+1, p = m−1 and
n = m^2 − s where s is
- r − x if y = −r,
- p + (y + r) if x = −r,
- 2p + (x + r) if y = r,
- 3p + (r − y) if x = r.

The eight neighbor values are:
2208, 2209, 2210,
2025,      2211,
1850, 2027, 2212.

Their sum is 16952.
