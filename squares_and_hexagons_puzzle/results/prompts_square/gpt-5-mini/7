Put 1 at (0,0), x to the right, y up. The spiral gives 45^2 = 2025 at (22,-22), so 2026 is at (23,-22).

The eight neighbours of (23,-22) are:
(22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21),
(22,-22),         (24,-22),
(22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23).

For a point (x,y) with r = max(|x|,|y|) the ring r starts at (2r-1)^2 + 1 located at (r, -(r-1)), and numbers run counterclockwise around the ring. Using that:

- (22,-21): r=22 → start = 43^2+1 = 1849+1 = 1850
- (23,-21): r=23 → start = 45^2+1 = 2026 → value = 2026+1 = 2027
- (24,-21): r=24 → start = 47^2+1 = 2209+1 = 2210 → value = 2210+2 = 2212
- (22,-22): r=22 → bottom-right corner = 45^2 = 2025
- (24,-22): r=24 → value = 2210+1 = 2211
- (22,-23): r=23 → value = 2026+182 = 2208
- (23,-23): r=23 → bottom-right corner = 47^2 = 2209
- (24,-23): r=24 → start = 2210

Adding them:
1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 = 16952.

Answer: 16952.
