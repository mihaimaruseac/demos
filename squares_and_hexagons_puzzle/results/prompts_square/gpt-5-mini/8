Put 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), etc. The maximal number on ring k is m = (2k+1)^2 at (k,-k). For N=2026 we have 45^2 = 2025 < 2026 ≤ 47^2 = 2209, so k = 23 and m = 2209. The offset t from the bottom-right corner is t = m − N = 2209 − 2026 = 183, so 2026 is at (x,y) = (23,−22) (one step up from the bottom-right corner of ring 23).

The eight neighbors are at
(22,−23)=2208,
(23,−23)=2209,
(24,−23)=2210,
(22,−22)=2025,
(24,−22)=2211,
(22,−21)=1850,
(23,−21)=2027,
(24,−21)=2212.

Summing them gives 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
