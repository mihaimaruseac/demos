Put 1 at (0,0) and use coordinates (x,y) with x to the right, y up. Layer s consists of all cells with max(|x|,|y|)=s and its first number is at (s, −(s−1)):

Nstart(s) = (2s−1)^2 + 1, and the numbers increase clockwise around the layer.

2026 lies just after 2025 = 45^2 = (2·22+1)^2, so 2025 is at (22,−22) and 2026 is at (23,−22). The eight neighbors of (23,−22) and their values are:

- (22,−21): Nstart(22) = 43^2 + 1 = 1850
- (23,−21): 2027
- (24,−21): Nstart(24)+2 = 2212
- (22,−22): 2025
- (24,−22): Nstart(24)+1 = 2211
- (22,−23): 2208
- (23,−23): 2209
- (24,−23): Nstart(24) = 2210

Summing: 1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 = 16952.

Answer: 16952.
