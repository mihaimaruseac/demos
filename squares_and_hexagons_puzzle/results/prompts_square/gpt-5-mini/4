Put 1 at (0,0) and use coordinates (x,y) with the spiral going right, up, left, down. The odd square 2025 = 45^2 is at (22,-22), so 2026 is at (23,-22) (one step to the right).

The eight neighbors are at
(22,-23), (23,-23), (24,-23),
(22,-22),         (24,-22),
(22,-21), (23,-21), (24,-21).

Use the fact that for ring r = max(|x|,|y|) the bottom-right corner value is br = (2r+1)^2 and for a point on that ring
- if y = -r: value = br - (r - x)
- if x = r: value = br - (6r + (r - y))
(and similarly for other edges). Evaluating gives
(22,-23)=2208, (23,-23)=2209, (24,-23)=2210,
(22,-22)=2025,             (24,-22)=2211,
(22,-21)=1850, (23,-21)=2027, (24,-21)=2212.

Summing these eight numbers: 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.

Answer: 16952.
