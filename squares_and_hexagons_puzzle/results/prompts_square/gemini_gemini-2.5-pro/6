This is a fun problem that involves understanding the structure of the number spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure

First, let's assign coordinates to the numbers on the grid, with the number 1 at the origin (0,0).

*   `1` is at `(0, 0)`
*   `2` is at `(1, 0)`
*   `3` is at `(1, 1)`
*   `4` is at `(0, 1)`
*   `5` is at `(-1, 1)`
*   `...` and so on.

The spiral forms layers of squares. The key insight is to look at the numbers at the corners of these squares.
*   The 1x1 square has `1` (`1^2`) as its largest number.
*   The 3x3 square ends at `9` (`3^2`), at coordinate `(1, -1)`.
*   The 5x5 square ends at `25` (`5^2`), at coordinate `(2, -2)`.
*   The 7x7 square ends at `49` (`7^2`), at coordinate `(3, -3)`.

We can see a pattern here: The square of an odd number `n` always lies on the bottom-right diagonal at coordinate `((n-1)/2, -(n-1)/2)`.

### 2. Finding the Location of 2026

To find where 2026 is, we should first find the nearest perfect square of an odd number.

*   Let's take the square root of 2026: `√2026 ≈ 45.01`.
*   The closest odd number is 45.
*   Let's square 45: `45^2 = 2025`.

This is very helpful! We know the number 2025 is a corner of one of the squares. Using our pattern, for `n=45`, the coordinate is:
`x = (45-1)/2 = 22`
`y = -(45-1)/2 = -22`
So, the number **2025** is at coordinate **(22, -22)**.

The spiral builds outwards. After completing a square (like the one ending in 2025), the very next number is placed one step to the right.
*   `2025` is at `(22, -22)`.
*   Therefore, **2026** must be at **(23, -22)**.

### 3. Identifying the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of the number at `(x, y)` are located at the coordinates `(x±1, y)`, `(x, y±1)`, and `(x±1, y±1)`.
The neighbors of 2026 at `(23, -22)` are at the following coordinates:

*   Top row: `(22, -21)`, `(23, -21)`, `(24, -21)`
*   Middle row: `(22, -22)`, `(24, -22)`
*   Bottom row: `(22, -23)`, `(23, -23)`, `(24, -23)`

### 4. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

Now we need to find the number at each of these 8 coordinates. We can do this by understanding how the numbers are generated along the edges of the squares. Let's find the values for the two main squares involved: the one ending in `45^2=2025` and the next one ending in `47^2=2209`.

**Square layer 1: Numbers related to 2025 = 45²**
This square has corners from `(22, -22)` to `(22, 22)`, `(-22, 22)`, etc.

*   **N(22, -22):** We already know this is **2025**.
*   **N(23, -21):** This point is just above 2026. Since the spiral is moving upwards along the line `x=23`, this number is simply `2026 + 1 =` **2027**.
*   **N(22, -21):** This point is on the right edge of the square whose largest corner is `43^2 = 1849`. The numbers increase as you go up this edge. The starting number of this edge (one step right from `43^2`) is `1849+1=1850`, located at `(22, -21)`. So, N(22,-21) is **1850**.

**Square layer 2: Numbers related to 2209 = 47²**
This square starts right after 2025. The corner `47^2=2209` is at `(23, -23)`.

*   **N(23, -23):** This is the corner of the next larger square, so it is `47^2 =` **2209**.
*   **N(22, -23):** This is the number just before the corner 2209, so it is `2209 - 1 =` **2208**.
*   **N(24, -23):** After the corner 2209, the spiral moves one step right to start the next layer. So this number is `2209 + 1 =` **2210**.
*   **N(24, -22):** This is the next number up the new right-hand edge, so it is `2210 + 1 =` **2211**.
*   **N(24, -21):** And the next number after that is `2211 + 1 =` **2212**.

Let's summarize the 8 neighbors in a grid around 2026:

| 1850 | 2027 | 2212 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | 2026 | 2211 |
| 2208 | 2209 | 2210 |

The 8 neighbors are: 1850, 2027, 2212, 2025, 2211, 2208, 2209, and 2210.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Finally, we sum these 8 numbers:

Sum = 1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210

Let's group them for easier calculation:
*   (2025 + 2027) = 4052
*   (2208 + 2212) = 4420
*   (2209 + 2211) = 4420
*   1850 + 2210 = 4060

Sum = 4052 + 4420 + 4420 + 4060
Sum = 8472 + 8480
Sum = **16952**
