This problem requires us to understand the structure of the number spiral and then locate the number 2026 and its neighbors.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure

Let's assign coordinates to the grid, with the number 1 at the origin (0,0). The spiral moves counter-clockwise.

- 1 is at (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0)
- 3 is at (1,1)
- 4 is at (0,1)
- 5 is at (-1,1)
- ...and so on.

A key pattern emerges when looking at the numbers at the corners of the squares formed by the spiral. The numbers in the bottom-right corners are the squares of odd numbers.

- The 1x1 square has its bottom-right corner at (0,0) with value 1 = 1².
- The 3x3 square has its bottom-right corner at (1,-1) with value 9 = 3².
- The 5x5 square has its bottom-right corner at (2,-2) with value 25 = 5².

In general, the (2k+1)x(2k+1) square (which we can call the k-th ring) has its bottom-right corner at coordinates (k, -k) and contains the number (2k+1)².

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

To find 2026, we first find the square it belongs to. We look for the smallest odd square greater than or equal to 2026.

- We can estimate: √2026 ≈ 45.
- Let's check 45²: 45² = 2025.

This is very close! The number 2025 is a bottom-right corner of a square.
- Since 2025 = 45², it corresponds to (2k+1)² where 2k+1 = 45. This gives k = 22.
- So, the number 2025 is at coordinates (22, -22).

The spiral path continues from the bottom-right corner by moving one step to the right to start the next layer.
- After 9 (at (1,-1)), comes 10 (at (2,-1)).
- After 25 (at (2,-2)), comes 26 (at (3,-2)).
- Therefore, after 2025 (at (22,-22)), comes 2026, which must be at coordinates **(23, -22)**.

### 3. Finding the 8 Neighbors of 2026

Let N = 2026 be at (x,y) = (23, -22). Its 8 neighbors are at the following coordinates:
- Top-Left: (x-1, y+1) = (22, -21)
- Top: (x, y+1) = (23, -21)
- Top-Right: (x+1, y+1) = (24, -21)
- Left: (x-1, y) = (22, -22)
- Right: (x+1, y) = (24, -22)
- Bottom-Left: (x-1, y-1) = (22, -23)
- Bottom: (x, y-1) = (23, -23)
- Bottom-Right: (x+1, y-1) = (24, -23)

### 4. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

Now we need to find the number at each of these 8 coordinates.

1.  **Left Neighbor (22, -22):** This is the location of the number **2025**.

2.  **Top-Left Neighbor (22, -21):** This point is on the right edge of the k=22 square. The top-right corner of this square is at (22, 22) and the bottom-right is at (22,-22). The number at the top-right corner (22,22) is 45² - 3×(45-1) = 2025 - 3×44 = 2025 - 132 = 1893. The numbers increase as we go down this edge. The value at (22, y) is 1893 + (22-y). For y=-21, the value is 1893 + (22 - (-21)) = 1893 + 43 = **1936**.

3.  **Top Neighbor (23, -21):** This is on the same spiral arm as 2026. The spiral moves up from 2026. So this is **2027**.

4.  **Bottom Neighbor (23, -23):** This is the bottom-right corner of the k=23 square. The value is (2×23 + 1)² = 47² = **2209**.

5.  **Bottom-Left Neighbor (22, -23):** This point is on the bottom edge of the k=23 square. The spiral moves left from the corner at (23,-23). So, this value is 2209 - 1 = **2208**.

6.  **Bottom-Right Neighbor (24, -23):** After the corner 2209 at (23,-23), the spiral starts the k=24 ring by moving one step right. So, this value is 2209 + 1 = **2210**.

7.  **Right Neighbor (24, -22):** From 2210 at (24,-23), the spiral moves up. So this value is 2210 + 1 = **2211**.

8.  **Top-Right Neighbor (24, -21):** Continuing up from 2211 at (24,-22), we get **2212**.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors' values:
- 1936
- 2027
- 2212
- 2025
- 2211
- 2208
- 2209
- 2210

Now, we sum them up:
1936 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210

Let's group them for easier addition:
- (2025 + 2027) = 4052
- (2208 + 2212) = 4420
- (2209 + 2211) = 4420
- (1936 + 2210) = 4146

Total Sum = 4052 + 4420 + 4420 + 4146 = **17038**
