This is a fantastic problem that involves understanding the structure of the number spiral. Let's break it down step by step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure

The spiral is built in square "rings" or "layers" around the number 1. The key to navigating this grid is to notice the pattern of the square numbers.

- The 1st ring is a 3x3 square, ending with **3² = 9**.
- The 2nd ring is a 5x5 square, ending with **5² = 25**.
- The 3rd ring is a 7x7 square, ending with **7² = 49**.
- In general, the *k*-th ring is a (2*k*+1)x(2*k*+1) square and its largest number is **(2*k*+1)²**.

These largest numbers (the odd squares) are always found in the **bottom-right corner** of their respective square.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

To find 2026, we first find the nearest perfect odd square.
Let's test some squares:
- 40² = 1600
- 50² = 2500
- Let's try 45²: `45 * 45 = 2025`.

This is perfect! The number **2025** is an odd square, so it's a corner on the spiral.
- Since 2025 = 45², we can find its ring number *k* by solving `2k+1 = 45`.
- `2k = 44`, which means `k = 22`.
- So, 2025 is the largest number in the 22nd ring.

### 3. Finding the Coordinates of 2025 and 2026

Let's set up a coordinate system with 1 at the origin (0,0).
- The corner 9 (3²) is at (1, -1). (for k=1)
- The corner 25 (5²) is at (2, -2). (for k=2)
- The corner 49 (7²) is at (3, -3). (for k=3)
Following this pattern, the corner `(2k+1)²` is at coordinate `(k, -k)`.

For 2025, where k=22, its coordinate is **(22, -22)**.

After reaching a bottom-right corner like 2025, the spiral moves one step to the right to begin the next ring. Therefore, the number **2026** is at coordinate **(23, -22)**.

### 4. Identifying the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at `(23, -22)` are at the following coordinates:
- Top-left: `(22, -21)`
- Top: `(23, -21)`
- Top-right: `(24, -21)`
- Left: `(22, -22)`
- Right: `(24, -22)`
- Bottom-left: `(22, -23)`
- Bottom: `(23, -23)`
- Bottom-right: `(24, -23)`

### 5. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

Now we need to find the number at each of these 8 coordinates. This requires us to trace the spiral path.

- **Neighbor at (22, -22):** We already know this is **2025**.

- **Neighbor at (23, -21):** The number 2026 is at the start of the "upward" path on the right side of the 23rd ring. The next number in the sequence simply moves one step up. So, the number at `(23, -21)` is **2027**.

- **Neighbor at (22, -21):** This is part of the 22nd ring. The path of the 22nd ring starts after 43² = 1849. The first number, 1850, is at `(22, -21)`. So, the neighbor at `(22, -21)` is **1850**.

- **Neighbor at (23, -23):** This is part of the 23rd ring, which ends at 47² = 2209. The corner 2209 = 47² lies at `(23, -23)`. So, the neighbor at `(23, -23)` is **2209**.

- **Neighbor at (22, -23):** This is on the bottom edge of the 23rd ring. The path moves from left to right, ending at 2209 at `(23, -23)`. The number just before it, at `(22, -23)`, is `2209 - 1 =` **2208**.

- **Neighbor at (24, -23):** After the 23rd ring is complete at 2209, the spiral moves right to start the 24th ring. The number 2210 will be at `(24, -23)`. So, the neighbor at `(24, -23)` is **2210**.

- **Neighbor at (24, -22):** The 24th ring's path moves up from 2210. The number at `(24, -22)` is `2210 + 1 =` **2211**.

- **Neighbor at (24, -21):** Continuing up this path, the number at `(24, -21)` is `2211 + 1 =` **2212**.

### 6. Summing the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors we found:
1.  2025
2.  2027
3.  1850
4.  2209
5.  2208
6.  2210
7.  2211
8.  2212

Now, let's sum them up:
`Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1850 + 2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212`

It's easier to group them:
`Sum = (2025 + 2027) + 1850 + (2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)`
`Sum = 4052 + 1850 + (5 * 2210)`
`Sum = 4052 + 1850 + 11050`
`Sum = 5902 + 11050`
`Sum = 16952`

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16952**.
