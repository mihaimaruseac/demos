This is a fantastic problem that involves understanding the structure of the number spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure and Coordinates

First, we need to define a coordinate system for the grid. Let the number 1 be at the origin (0, 0). Following the spiral's path as shown in the sample:

*   1 is at (0, 0)
*   2 is at (1, 0) (Move Right 1)
*   3 is at (1, 1) (Move Up 1)
*   4 is at (0, 1)
*   5 is at (-1, 1) (Move Left 2)
*   6 is at (-1, 0)
*   7 is at (-1, -1) (Move Down 2)
*   8 is at (0, -1)
*   9 is at (1, -1) (Move Right 2)

The spiral moves in segments of increasing length: R 1, U 1, L 2, D 2, R 3, U 3, L 4, D 4, and so on.

A key observation is the location of the corners of the squares formed by the spiral. Let's look at the numbers at the "South-East" (SE) corners, which have coordinates `(k, -k)`.

*   `9 = 3²` is at (1, -1). Here, `k=1`. Note that `3 = 2k+1`.
*   `25 = 5²` is at (2, -2). Here, `k=2`. Note that `5 = 2k+1`.

This reveals a crucial pattern: The perfect odd square `(2k+1)²` is located at the SE corner with coordinates `(k, -k)`.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find where 2026 lies on this grid. Let's find the nearest perfect odd square.
*   `40² = 1600`
*   `50² = 2500`
*   Let's try `45²`. `45 * 45 = 2025`.

So, the number 2025 is a perfect odd square. Using our pattern:
*   `2025 = 45² = (2k+1)²`
*   `2k+1 = 45`  => `2k = 44` => `k = 22`.

The number **2025** is located at the SE corner with coordinates **(22, -22)**.

Now, we need to know which way the spiral turns after a SE corner.
*   After 9 at (1, -1), the path moves Right. But 9 is not a SE corner in this pattern.
*   Let's re-trace the path to 25. The path arriving at the SE corner `(k, -k)` is a Rightward segment of length `2k`. The path arriving at 25(2,-2) is R4, from 21(-2,-2) to 25(2,-2).
*   After the SE corner `(k, -k)`, the spiral always turns **Up**.

Therefore, the number **2026** is directly above 2025.
*   The coordinates of 2025 are (22, -22).
*   The coordinates of **2026** are **(22, -21)**.

### 3. Identifying the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of 2026 at `(22, -21)` are located at the following coordinates:
*   North (N): (22, -20)
*   South (S): (22, -22)
*   East (E): (23, -21)
*   West (W): (21, -21)
*   North-East (NE): (23, -20)
*   North-West (NW): (21, -20)
*   South-East (SE): (23, -22)
*   South-West (SW): (21, -22)

### 4. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

Now we find the number at each of these 8 coordinates.

*   **South (S) at (22, -22):** This is the number **2025**.
*   **North (N) at (22, -20):** Since 2026 is on a vertical (Up) path, its North neighbor is simply **2027**.

*   **West-side neighbors (W, NW, SW):** These have x-coordinate 21. They belong to the square whose SE corner is `43² = 1849` at `(21, -21)`.
    *   **W at (21, -21):** This is the SE corner of the `k=21` square, so its value is `43² =` **1849**.
    *   **NW at (21, -20):** After the SE corner 1849, the path goes Up. So the number at (21, -20) is `1849 + 1 =` **1850**.
    *   **SW at (21, -22):** This point is on the Rightward path leading to the SE corner `(22, -22) = 2025`. The number just before 2025 is 2024, which is at (21, -22). So, the value is **2024**.

*   **East-side neighbors (E, NE, SE):** These have x-coordinate 23. They belong to the next square out, whose SE corner is `47² = 2209` at `(23, -23)`.
    *   The path goes Up from this corner. The value at `(23, y)` is `2209 + (y - (-23)) = 2209 + y + 23`.
    *   **E at (23, -21):** Value = `2209 + (-21) + 23 =` **2211**.
    *   **NE at (23, -20):** Value = `2209 + (-20) + 23 =` **2212**.
    *   **SE at (23, -22):** Value = `2209 + (-22) + 23 =` **2210**.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors we found:
1.  N:  2027
2.  S:  2025
3.  W:  1849
4.  E:  2211
5.  NW: 1850
6.  SW: 2024
7.  NE: 2212
8.  SE: 2210

Now, we sum them up:
Sum = 2027 + 2025 + 1849 + 2211 + 1850 + 2024 + 2212 + 2210

Let's group them for easier addition:
*   (2027 + 2025) = 4052
*   (1849 + 2211) = 4060
*   (1850 + 2210) = 4060
*   (2024 + 2212) = 4236

Total Sum = 4052 + 4060 + 4060 + 4236 = **16408**

An interesting observation is that for a number `N` on a straight segment, the sum of pairs of opposite neighbors follows a pattern. For `N=2026`:
*   N + S = 2N
*   E + W = 2N + 8
*   NW + SE = 2N + 8
*   NE + SW = 2N + 184
The sum is `8N + 200 = 8(2026) + 200 = 16208 + 200 = 16408`.

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16,408**.
