This problem requires us to determine the location of the number 2026 in the spiral grid and then identify its 8 neighbors.

### Step 1: Analyze the Spiral's Structure

The spiral is built in layers around the number 1. Let's look at the numbers at the corners of each square layer. The spiral turns at each corner.
- The 1x1 square is just the number 1.
- The 3x3 square ends at the bottom-right with the number 9, which is 3².
- The 5x5 square ends at the bottom-right with 25, which is 5².
- The 7x7 square ends at the bottom-right with 49, which is 7².

The pattern is that the bottom-right corner of the (2n+1) x (2n+1) square is the number (2n+1)².

### Step 2: Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which layer 2026 belongs to. We can do this by finding the odd square number closest to 2026.
Let's take the square root of 2026.
√2026 ≈ 45.
Let's check 45²:
45² = (40 + 5)² = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025.

So, the number 2025 is a bottom-right corner of a square layer. Specifically, it's the corner of the 45x45 square.

Now, let's determine the direction of the spiral to find 2026.
The initial grid shows:
`... 8 9 ...`
After completing the 3x3 square at 9, the spiral continues. Based on the counter-clockwise pattern, the next number, 10, is placed to the right of 9 to start the next layer.
`... 9 10 ...`
Similarly, after completing the 45x45 square at the bottom-right corner (2025), the spiral continues by moving one step to the right. Therefore, 2026 is immediately to the right of 2025.

### Step 3: Identify the 8 Neighbors of 2026

Let's represent the number 2026 and its 8 neighbors in a 3x3 grid:

```
TL  T  TR
 L  N   R
BL  B  BR
```

Here, N = 2026.
From our finding, the number to the left (L) is 2025.
`L = 2025`

The spiral path after 2026 moves upwards. So, the number above 2026 (T) is 2027.
`T = 2027`

Now we need to find the other 6 neighbors. These numbers are determined by the structure of the spiral layers.

-   **TL (Top-Left):** This is the number above L (2025). The number 2025 is the bottom-right corner of the 45x45 square. The number above it is part of the right edge of that same square. The top-right corner of the 45x45 square is 45² - 3×(45-1) = 2025 - 3×44 = 2025 - 132 = 1893. The numbers increase by 1 going down the right edge. The y-coordinate goes from 22 down to -22. The number above 2025 is 2025 - (side length -1) - (side length -1) ... This is complicated.
    A simpler method: The right-edge values of the 45x45 square are one less than the right-edge values of the 47x47 square. The right edge of the 47x47 square starts with 2026, 2027, etc. The number to the left of 2027 is `2027 - (47-1) - (47-1) = 2027 - 92?` No.
    Let's find it from the previous square, 43². 43²=1849. The top-right corner of the 43x43 square is 1849 - 3*(42)=1723. The number below it is 1724.
    Let's use a simpler observation. The difference between a number `m` on a layer and the number just "inside" it on the previous layer is related to the layer number.
    The number above 2025 is `2025 - (45-1) - (43-1) = 2025 - 44 - 42 = 1939`. No.
    Let's calculate from corners. The right vertical column of the 45x45 grid ends at 2025. It starts after the top-right corner, 1893. The number below 1893 is 1894. The number at the top of the column (y=22) is 1893. The number above the bottom (y=-21) is `1893 + (22 - (-21)) = 1893 + 43 = 1936`. So, `TL = 1936`.

-   **R (Right):** The numbers to the right of the `...2026, 2027, ...` column belong to the next layer, which starts after the 47x47 square is complete. The 47x47 square ends at 47² = 2209. The next number, 2210, is to the right of 2209. The path then goes up. The column to the right of `...2026, 2027...` starts with 2210 at the bottom, then 2211, 2212, etc. The neighbor `R` is at the same row as 2026. So `R = 2211`.

-   **B (Bottom):** Below 2026. The 47x47 square's bottom-right corner is 47² = 2209. This is below the start of the right edge. `B = 2209`.

Now we can fill in the neighbors based on these key values:
-   `L = 2025`
-   `T = 2027`
-   `TL` is above `L`, so it's `1936`.
-   `R` is to the right of `N`. We found this column starts with 2210 and goes up. `R = 2211`.
-   `B` is below `N`. It's the BR corner of the 47x47 square. `B = 2209`.
-   `TR` is above `R`. `TR = 2212`.
-   `BL` is below `L`. `BL = B - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208`.
-   `BR` is below `R`. `BR = R - 1 = 2211 - 1 = 2210`.

Let's assemble the 3x3 grid around 2026:
```
1936  2027  2212
2025  2026  2211
2208  2209  2210
```

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum

Now, we sum all 8 neighbors:
Sum = 1936 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210

Let's group them for easier calculation:
-   (2025 + 2027) = 4052
-   (2208 + 2212) = 4420
-   (2209 + 2211) = 4420
-   1936 + 2210 = 4146

Let's sum these partial sums:
4052 + 4420 + 4420 + 4146 = 17038

Alternatively, we can notice a pattern. The sum of opposite neighbors:
-   L + R = 2025 + 2211 = 4236
-   T + B = 2027 + 2209 = 4236
-   TL + BR = 1936 + 2210 = 4146
-   TR + BL = 2212 + 2208 = 4420

Sum = 4236 + 4236 + 4146 + 4420 = 8472 + 8566 = 17038.

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17038**.
