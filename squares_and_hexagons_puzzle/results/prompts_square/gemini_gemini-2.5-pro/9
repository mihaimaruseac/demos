This problem requires us to locate the number 2026 in the spiral and then identify and sum its eight neighbors.

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral's Structure

The spiral is built in square layers or rings around the central number 1.
- The 1x1 square contains only the number 1. Its largest value is 1 = 1².
- The 3x3 square contains numbers 1 through 9. Its largest value is 9 = 3².
- The 5x5 square contains numbers 1 through 25. Its largest value is 25 = 5².

In general, the `k`-th layer completes a `(2k-1) x (2k-1)` square, and the largest number in it is `(2k-1)²`. These largest numbers are always in the bottom-right corner of their respective squares.

### Step 2: Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which square layer 2026 belongs to. We can do this by finding the smallest odd square greater than or equal to 2026.
Let's test some squares:
- 40² = 1600
- 50² = 2500
Let's try odd numbers in between. A good guess is 45.
- 45² = 2025

So, 2025 is the largest number in the 45x45 square. This corresponds to `2k-1 = 45`, which means `k=23`. The number 2025 is the bottom-right corner of the 23rd layer.

The number 2026 is the very next number in the sequence. The spiral grows by moving one step to the right from a completed square's corner.
- After 1 (1²), we move right to get 2.
- After 9 (3²), we move right to get 10.
- After 25 (5²), we move right to get 26.

Following this pattern, 2026 is located one position to the right of 2025.

### Step 3: Identify the Neighbors of 2026

Let `X = 2026`. We need to find the sum of its 8 neighbors.
Let's arrange them in a grid:
```
NW  N  NE
 W  X   E
SW  S  SE
```
Since 2026 is immediately to the right of 2025, the number to the West of 2026 is 2025.
`W = 2025`

The spiral path from 2025 goes `... 2025, 2026, 2027, ...`. After moving right to 2026, the spiral continues by moving upwards. So, the number to the North of 2026 is 2027.
`N = 2027`

The other six neighbors (NW, NE, E, SE, S, SW) belong to different parts of the spiral. The key insight is that for any number `M` located on a straight segment of the spiral (not at a corner), the sum of its opposite cardinal neighbors is constant.
That is, `N + S = E + W`.

We have `N = 2027` and `W = 2025`. We need to find the values for `E` (East) and `S` (South).

- **Finding E:** The number `E` is to the right of `X=2026`. It lies on the next layer of the spiral. We can find its value by considering the corner it is related to. The corner of the next square (the 47x47 square) is 47² = 2209. This is the new bottom-right corner. The number before it is 2208, and the number two steps before is 2207. The top-right corner is `47² - 3*(47-1) = 2209 - 3*46 = 2209 - 138 = 2071`. A more systematic way is to notice that the rightmost vertical column of the 47x47 square contains numbers that are two greater than their neighbors in the column to their left (the column containing 45²). `E` is the neighbor of `N=2027`'s right-hand neighbor, plus one. This is getting complicated.

Let's use a simpler, powerful property of the spiral. The number `E` is exactly two greater than the corner 47² = 2209. No, that's not right. A simpler way is to notice the differences. The number `E` is part of the 49x49 square.
The number `E` is located to the right of 2026. The number `S` is located below 2026. `E` is part of the next layer out.
A simpler observation is that the sum of opposite pairs `N+S` and `E+W` is constant for any number not on a corner.
`S` is the number below 2026. This position corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the 47x47 square, which is `47² = 2209`.
`S = 2209`.

`E` is located to the right of 2026. It is two more than the number S. `E = S + 2 = 2209 + 2 = 2211`.
Let's verify the property:
`N + S = 2027 + 2209 = 4236`
`E + W = 2211 + 2025 = 4236`
The property holds. The sum of the four cardinal neighbors is `4236 + 4236 = 8472`.

### Step 4: Find the Sum of the Diagonal Neighbors

Now we find the four diagonal neighbors. We can find them relative to the cardinal neighbors.
- `NW` is one less than `N`. But this only works if the path is horizontal. Here the path is vertical. `NW` is `W-c1`.
- `NW` is diagonally adjacent to `W=2025` (the 45x45 corner). The number before 2025 was on the bottom edge. A simpler approach is to see `NW` is one greater than the corner of the previous square, `43²`.
  `NW = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850`.
- `SE` is one greater than `S`. No, `SE` is `S-1`. Let's re-verify. `S=2209=47^2`. The number before it is 2208. That's to its left. `SE` is located one spot to the right of `S`. This is part of the next, 49x49, spiral layer. `SE = 47^2 + 47*2+1 = 2209+95 = 2304?` No. A simpler pattern exists.
- `SE = E - 1 = 2211 - 1 = 2210`.
- `NE = E + 1 = 2211 + 1 = 2212`.
- `SW` is one less than `S`. `SW = S - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208`.

Let's summarize the diagonal neighbors:
- `NW = 1850`
- `SW = 2208`
- `NE = 2212`
- `SE = 2210`

The sum of the diagonal neighbors is `1850 + 2208 + 2212 + 2210 = 8480`.

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Sum

The sum of all 8 neighbors is the sum of the cardinal neighbors plus the sum of the diagonal neighbors.
Total Sum = (Sum of Cardinals) + (Sum of Diagonals)
Total Sum = `8472 + 8480`
Total Sum = `16952`

Final check of the neighbors:
- N = 2027
- S = 2209
- W = 2025
- E = 2211
- NW = 1850
- NE = 2212
- SW = 2208
- SE = 2210

Sum = 2027+2209+2025+2211+1850+2212+2208+2210 = 16952.
