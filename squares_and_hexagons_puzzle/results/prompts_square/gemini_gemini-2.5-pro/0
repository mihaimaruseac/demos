This is a classic problem involving a square spiral of numbers. Let's break it down by first finding the location of 2026 and then identifying its neighbors.

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral's Structure

The spiral grows in layers around the central number 1. Let's define the layers:
- Layer 0: Contains only 1. This is a 1x1 square.
- Layer 1: Numbers 2 to 9. This completes a 3x3 square. The largest number is 9 = 3².
- Layer 2: Numbers 10 to 25. This completes a 5x5 square. The largest number is 25 = 5².
- Layer k: Completes a (2k+1) x (2k+1) square. The largest number in this layer is **(2k+1)²**.

The corners of these squares are key to navigating the grid. The number (2k+1)² is always located at the bottom-right corner of its layer, at coordinates **(k, -k)** if we set 1 to be at (0,0) and 2 at (1,0).

### Step 2: Locate the Number 2026

We need to find which layer 2026 belongs to. We can do this by finding the nearest odd square number.

1.  Calculate the square root of 2026: √2026 ≈ 45.01.
2.  The nearest odd integer to 45.01 is 45.
3.  Let's find 45²: 45² = 2025.

This tells us that the number **2025** is the largest number in a layer. Specifically, it's the largest number in the layer where (2k+1) = 45.
2k+1 = 45  =>  2k = 44  =>  k = 22.

So, the number 2025 is the last number in Layer 22, completing a 45x45 square. Its coordinate is (k, -k) = (22, -22).

The spiral continues from 2025 by moving one step to the right to start the next layer (Layer 23). Therefore, the number **2026** is located at coordinates **(23, -22)**.

### Step 3: Identify the Coordinates of the 8 Neighbors

The number 2026 is at P = (23, -22). Its 8 neighbors are at the surrounding coordinates:
- **N** (North): (23, -21)
- **NE** (Northeast): (24, -21)
- **E** (East): (24, -22)
- **SE** (Southeast): (24, -23)
- **S** (South): (23, -23)
- **SW** (Southwest): (22, -23)
- **W** (West): (22, -22)
- **NW** (Northwest): (22, -21)

### Step 4: Find the Value of Each Neighbor

We need to determine which layer each neighbor belongs to and trace the spiral's path to find its value.

- **W (22, -22):** This is the location of **2025**, as we found earlier.

- **NW (22, -21):** This point is on the "right arm" of the Layer 22 square. The spiral path for Layer 22 starts right after Layer 21 finishes. Layer 21 finishes at (2*21+1)² = 43² = 1849. The first number of Layer 22 is 1850, located at (22, -21). So, the value at NW is **1850**.

- **N (23, -21):** This point is on the same arm as 2026. The spiral moves from 2026 upwards. So, the value at N is **2027**.

Now let's find the values for the neighbors in Layer 23 and Layer 24.

- **S (23, -23) and SW (22, -23):** These points are on the bottom arm of Layer 23. The last number in Layer 23 is at its bottom-right corner (23, -23). This value is (2*23+1)² = 47² = 2209.
    - So, the value at **S (23, -23)** is **2209**.
    - The path reaches this corner from the left, so the number just before it, at **SW (22, -23)**, is **2208**.

- **SE (24, -23), E (24, -22), NE (24, -21):** These points are on the "right arm" of the next layer, Layer 24. This layer starts after Layer 23 ends (at 2209).
    - The first number of Layer 24 is 2210. It is located at (24, -23), one step right from the end of the previous layer's bottom arm.
    - So, the value at **SE (24, -23)** is **2210**.
    - The spiral then moves up. The value at **E (24, -22)** is **2211**.
    - The value at **NE (24, -21)** is **2212**.

### Step 5: Sum the Values of the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors and their values:
- N:  2027
- NE: 2212
- E:  2211
- SE: 2210
- S:  2209
- SW: 2208
- W:  2025
- NW: 1850

Now, we sum them up:
2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2209 + 2208 + 2025 + 1850

Let's group them for easier calculation:
(2027 + 2025) = 4052
(2212 + 2208) = 4420
(2211 + 2209) = 4420
2210 + 1850 = 4060

Sum = 4052 + 4420 + 4420 + 4060 = **16952**
