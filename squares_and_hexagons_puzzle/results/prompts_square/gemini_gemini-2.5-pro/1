Here is a step-by-step solution to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure

First, we need to understand how the spiral is constructed. The number 1 is at the center. The spiral moves counter-clockwise, forming square "shells" or "rings".

Let's assign coordinates to the grid, with `1` at `(0, 0)`.
- The number `2` is at `(1, 0)`.
- The number `3` is at `(1, 1)`.
- The number `5` is at `(-1, 1)`.
- The number `7` is at `(-1, -1)`.
- The number `9` is at `(1, -1)`.

A key observation is the numbers at the corners of these square shells. The bottom-right corners are particularly useful.
- The 1x1 square (shell 0) ends with `1 = 1^2`.
- The 3x3 square (shell 1) ends with `9 = 3^2`. The corner is at `(1, -1)`.
- The 5x5 square (shell 2) ends with `25 = 5^2`. The corner is at `(2, -2)`.

In general, the `(2k+1) x (2k+1)` square (shell `k`) has its bottom-right corner at coordinate `(k, -k)`, and the number at that corner is `(2k+1)^2`.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

The problem states that 2026 has 8 neighbors, which implies it is not on the outer edge of the spiral. We can use this as a hint and proceed by finding its location on an infinite grid.

First, we find which square shell 2026 belongs to. We need to find an odd number `m` such that `m^2` is close to 2026.
- Let's try `40^2 = 1600` and `50^2 = 2500`. The number is between 40 and 50.
- `45^2 = 2025`.

This is a perfect match. So, the number `2025` is a corner of a square shell.
- `m = 45`, which is `2k+1`. This gives `2k = 44`, so `k=22`.
- The number `2025` is `(2*22+1)^2`, the bottom-right corner of the 45x45 square (shell 22).
- The coordinate of `2025` is `(k, -k) = (22, -22)`.

Now, where is `2026`? The spiral path continues from the bottom-right corner by moving one step to the right to start the next shell.
- The number `2025` is at `(22, -22)`.
- The number `2026` is at `(23, -22)`.

### 3. Finding the 8 Neighbors

Now we need to find the numbers at the 8 coordinates surrounding `(23, -22)`. These are:
- Top-Left: `(22, -21)`
- Top: `(23, -21)`
- Top-Right: `(24, -21)`
- Left: `(22, -22)`
- Right: `(24, -22)`
- Bottom-Left: `(22, -23)`
- Bottom: `(23, -23)`
- Bottom-Right: `(24, -23)`

### 4. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

We'll determine the value at each coordinate by tracing the spiral's path.

- **`N(22, -22)` (Left):** We already found this. It is **2025**.

- **`N(23, -21)` (Top):** The number 2026 starts the "right" segment of the next shell (`k=23`). The path moves up from here. So, the number above 2026 is **2027**.

- **`N(22, -21)` (Top-Left):** This position is on the "right" segment of the previous shell (`k=22`). The numbers on this segment increase as we move down. Since `N(22, -22) = 2025`, the number one step above it must be `2025 - 1 =` **2024**.

- **`N(23, -23)` (Bottom):** This position is on the bottom edge of the `k=23` shell. This shell completes the `47x47` square. Its bottom-right corner is `47^2 = 2209`. So, `N(23, -23) =` **2209**.

- **`N(22, -23)` (Bottom-Left):** This is on the same bottom edge as 2209. The numbers increase from left to right. So, the number to the left of 2209 is `2209 - 1 =` **2208**.

- **`N(24, -23)` (Bottom-Right):** The `k=23` shell ends at `2209` at `(23, -23)`. The next shell (`k=24`) starts by moving one step to the right. So, `N(24, -23) = 2209 + 1 =` **2210**.

- **`N(24, -22)` (Right):** The `k=24` shell path continues up from 2210. So, the number above 2210 is **2211**.

- **`N(24, -21)` (Top-Right):** Continuing up the `k=24` shell path, the number above 2211 is **2212**.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors we found:
1.  `2024` (Top-Left)
2.  `2027` (Top)
3.  `2212` (Top-Right)
4.  `2025` (Left)
5.  `2211` (Right)
6.  `2208` (Bottom-Left)
7.  `2209` (Bottom)
8.  `2210` (Bottom-Right)

Now, we sum them up:
`Sum = 2024 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210`

Let's group them for easier calculation:
`Sum = (2024 + 2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)`

The first group:
`2024 + 2025 + 2027 = 6076`

The second group is an arithmetic sequence of 5 terms with the middle term 2210:
`5 * 2210 = 11050`

Total sum:
`6076 + 11050 = 17126`

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17126**.
