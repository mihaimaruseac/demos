This is a fascinating problem that involves understanding the structure of the spiral grid. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure and Coordinates

First, we need to establish a coordinate system. Let's place the number 1 at the origin (0,0). The spiral grows outwards:
*   2 is at (1, 0)
*   3 is at (1, 1)
*   4 is at (0, 1)
*   9 is at (1, -1)

The spiral forms layers of squares.
*   The 3x3 square (layer 1) ends with 9 = 3². Its corners are at `max(|x|, |y|) = 1`.
*   The 5x5 square (layer 2) ends with 25 = 5². Its corners are at `max(|x|, |y|) = 2`.
*   The `(2k+1)x(2k+1)` square (layer `k`) ends with the number `(2k+1)²`. The bottom-right corner of this square is at coordinate `(k, -k)`.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find which layer 2026 is in. We can do this by finding the nearest perfect odd square.
*   Let's try 40² = 1600 (too small).
*   Let's try 50² = 2500 (too big).
*   Let's try 45².  `45² = 2025`.

This is extremely close! The number 2025 is the largest number in its square layer.
*   This square has a side length of 45. So, `2k+1 = 45`, which gives `k = 22`.
*   The number 2025 is the last number of the 22nd layer, forming a 45x45 square.
*   As established, the number `(2k+1)²` is at the bottom-right corner `(k, -k)`. Therefore, **2025 is at coordinate (22, -22)**.

The spiral continues from the last number of a layer by moving one step to the right to start the next layer.
*   For example, after 9 at (1, -1), the number 10 is at (2, -1).
*   Therefore, after 2025 at (22, -22), the number **2026 is at coordinate (23, -22)**.

### 3. Identifying the 8 Neighbors of 2026

The number `N = 2026` is at `(x, y) = (23, -22)`. Its 8 neighbors are at the surrounding coordinates:
*   Top row: `(22, -21)`, `(23, -21)`, `(24, -21)`
*   Middle row: `(22, -22)`, `(23, -22)`, `(24, -22)`
*   Bottom row: `(22, -23)`, `(23, -23)`, `(24, -23)`

Our grid around 2026 looks like this:
```
(22, -21)   (23, -21)   (24, -21)
(22, -22)      2026     (24, -22)
(22, -23)   (23, -23)   (24, -23)
```

### 4. Calculating the Value of Each Neighbor

Now we find the number at each of these 8 coordinates.

1.  **`f(22, -22)`**: We already know this is **2025**. It's the number right before 2026.
2.  **`f(23, -21)`**: The spiral path from 2026 at `(23,-22)` moves upwards. So the very next number is at `(23,-21)`. This is **2027**.

3.  **The `k=23` shell (where 2026 lives)**: This shell will complete the 47x47 square, ending at `47² = 2209`.
    *   This final number, 2209, will be at the bottom-right corner `(23, -23)`.
    *   **`f(23, -23)`**: This is the corner **2209**.
    *   The spiral path along the bottom edge `y=-23` moves from left to right. So the number just before `2209` is at `(22, -23)`.
    *   **`f(22, -23)`**: This is `2209 - 1 =` **2208**.

4.  **The `k=24` shell (the next one out)**: This shell begins after the `k=23` shell is complete (i.e., after 2209).
    *   The first number of this new shell is `2209 + 1 = 2210`.
    *   It starts one step to the right of the previous shell's corner, `(23,-23)`. So, it's at `(24, -23)`.
    *   **`f(24, -23)`**: This is **2210**.
    *   From here, the spiral moves upwards along the line `x=24`.
    *   **`f(24, -22)`**: This is `2210 + 1 =` **2211**.
    *   **`f(24, -21)`**: This is `2211 + 1 =` **2212**.

5.  **The `k=22` shell (the one inside)**: We still need to find `f(22, -21)`.
    *   This shell ends at `2025` at `(22,-22)`. Let's find the top-right corner of this shell, at `(22, 22)`.
    *   The value at the top-right corner `(k,k)` is `(2k-1)² + 2k`.
    *   For `k=22`, this is `(2*22-1)² + 2*22 = 43² + 44 = 1849 + 44 = 1893`.
    *   So, `f(22, 22) = 1893`.
    *   The spiral path moves downwards along the right edge `x=22`.
    *   The value at `f(22, y)` is `f(22, 22) + (22 - y)`.
    *   **`f(22, -21)`**: This is `1893 + (22 - (-21)) = 1893 + 43 =` **1936**.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Let's assemble our grid of neighbors around 2026:

```
1936   2027   2212
2025   2026   2211
2208   2209   2210
```

Now, we sum the 8 neighbors:
`1936 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210`

Let's add them up:
```
  1936
  2025
  2027
  2208
  2209
  2210
  2211
+ 2212
-------
 17038
```

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **17038**.
