This is a fantastic problem that involves understanding the structure of the number spiral. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Spiral's Structure

The key to solving this problem is to notice how the spiral is built. It expands outwards, forming larger and larger squares. The numbers on the bottom-right diagonal are perfect squares of odd numbers.

*   1 = 1²
*   9 = 3²
*   25 = 5²
*   49 = 7²
*   In general, the bottom-right corner of the `n`-th square (of size (2n-1)x(2n-1)) is the number `(2n-1)²`.

### 2. Locating the Number 2026

We need to find which "ring" or "layer" of the spiral 2026 is on. We can do this by finding the nearest perfect odd square.

*   Let's take the square root of 2026: √2026 ≈ 45.01.
*   The closest odd number to 45.01 is 45.
*   Let's calculate 45²: `45 * 45 = 2025`.

This is a crucial piece of information: **2025 is a bottom-right corner of a square.**

The number 2026 is simply the next number after 2025. Let's see how the spiral behaves after a bottom-right corner:
*   After 1, the spiral goes right to 2.
*   After 9, the spiral goes right to 10.
*   After 25, the spiral goes right to 26.

The pattern is clear: after completing a square at the bottom-right corner `m²`, the spiral moves one step to the right to begin the next layer with `m² + 1`.
So, **2026 is one position to the right of 2025.**

### 3. Setting up a Coordinate System

To find the neighbors, we need to know their positions precisely. Let's set up a Cartesian coordinate system with the number 1 at the origin (0, 0).

The bottom-right corners `(2k+1)²` are located at coordinates `(k+1, -k)`. Let's check:
*   `k=0`: 1²=1 is at (0,0). My formula is slightly off for the center. Let's adjust.
*   The corner of the `k`-th ring (size `(2k+1)x(2k+1)`) is `(2k+1)²` located at `(k, -k)`.
*   `k=1`: 3²=9 is at (1, -1).
*   `k=2`: 5²=25 is at (2, -2).

For our number 2025:
*   `2025 = 45²`. This is the `(2k+1)²` corner, so `2k+1 = 45`, which gives `k=22`.
*   The coordinate of **2025** is `(k, -k)` = **(22, -22)**.

Since 2026 is one step to the right, its coordinate is **(23, -22)**.

### 4. Finding the Values of the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of the number `N` at `(x, y)` are at coordinates `(x±1, y)`, `(x, y±1)`, and `(x±1, y±1)`.
The neighbors of **2026 at (23, -22)** are at the following coordinates:

1.  `(22, -22)` (West)
2.  `(24, -22)` (East)
3.  `(23, -21)` (North)
4.  `(23, -23)` (South)
5.  `(22, -21)` (North-West)
6.  `(24, -21)` (North-East)
7.  `(22, -23)` (South-West)
8.  `(24, -23)` (South-East)

Now we need to find the number at each of these coordinates. This requires figuring out the number patterns along the different arms of the spiral.

*   **Neighbor at (22, -22):** This is the location of **2025**.

*   **Path from 2026:** The spiral moves from 2026 at (23, -22) upwards. The numbers on this vertical line `x=23` are `2026, 2027, 2028, ...`.
    *   **Neighbor at (23, -21):** This is the next number after 2026, which is **2027**.

*   **Path for the previous layer (ending at 2025):** The number 1850 (`=43²+1`) is at (22, -21). The path goes up the line `x=22`.
    *   **Neighbor at (22, -21):** This is the first number of this upward arm, which is **1850**.

*   **Path for the next layer (the bottom arm):** After winding all the way around, the spiral lays down the numbers on the `y=-23` line. The bottom-left corner of this new square is `47² - (47-1) - (47-1) = 2209 - 46 - 46 = 2117`. The bottom-left corner is `2163` at `(-23,-23)`. The path moves right from there. The value at `(x, -23)` is `2163 + (x - (-23)) = x + 2186`.
    *   **Neighbor at (22, -23):** Value = `22 + 2186 =` **2208**.
    *   **Neighbor at (23, -23):** Value = `23 + 2186 =` **2209**. (Note: 2209 is 47²).

*   **Path for the layer after that (starting at 47²+1):** The number `2209 = 47²` is at `(23, -23)`. The next number, 2210, is one step to the right, at `(24, -23)`. The path then moves up the `x=24` line.
    *   **Neighbor at (24, -23):** This is **2210**.
    *   **Neighbor at (24, -22):** This is the next number up, **2211**.
    *   **Neighbor at (24, -21):** This is the next number up, **2212**.

### 5. Summing the Neighbors

Let's list the 8 neighbors we found:
1.  2025 (West)
2.  2027 (North)
3.  1850 (North-West)
4.  2208 (South-West)
5.  2209 (South)
6.  2210 (South-East)
7.  2211 (East)
8.  2212 (North-East)

Now, we sum them up:
`2025 + 2027 + 1850 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212`

Let's group them for easier calculation:
*   `2025 + 2027 = 4052`
*   `2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 5 * 2210 = 11050`
*   `Sum = 4052 + 1850 + 11050`
*   `Sum = 5902 + 11050`
*   `Sum = 16952`

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is **16,952**.
