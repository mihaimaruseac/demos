A concise way to see how the neighbors arise is to track how the standard “square‐spiral” (often called the Ulam spiral) extends ring by ring.  In that spiral:

• The center 1 is “ring 0.”  
• Ring n has side‐length 2n+1 and contains the integers from (2n−1)²+1 up through (2n+1)².  
• In particular, ring n starts at the coordinate (n, −(n−1)) and proceeds counterclockwise until it ends at (n, −n).

1)  Locating 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Since 45² = 2025 and 47² = 2209, the number 2026 lies in ring 23, which goes from 45²+1 = 2026 up through 47² = 2209.  By the spiral’s construction:

 • Ring 23 starts at (23, −22) with the value 2026.  
 • Ring 23 finishes at (23, −23) with the value 2209 (the “bottom‐right corner” of that ring).  

Hence 2026 sits at the grid‐coordinate (23, −22).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2)  Its eight neighbors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The eight neighbors of the cell (23, −22) are the squares at all offsets ±1 in x‐ and y‐coordinates:

  (22, −23), (23, −23), (24, −23),
  (22, −22),              (24, −22),
  (22, −21), (23, −21), (24, −21).

We find each of their values by seeing which ring they lie on and how that ring’s numbering proceeds.

1) (22, −22).  
   Since max|x|,|y| = 22, it lies on ring 22.  
   Ring 22 is from 43²+1 = 1849+1 = 1850 up to 45² = 2025.  
   Its “bottom‐right corner” is (22, −22) = 2025.

2) (23, −23).  
   This is the bottom‐right corner of ring 23, hence it is 2209.

3) (24, −23).  
   That lies on ring 24 (since max|24|,|−23| = 24).  
   Ring 24 goes 47²+1 = 2210 up to 49² = 2401, and starts at (24, −23) = 2210.

4) (24, −22).  
   Still on ring 24, one step “up” from (24, −23).  
   Hence (24, −22) = 2211.

5) (24, −21).  
   Continuing up ring 24’s right edge, so (24, −21) = 2212.

6) (23, −21).  
   This is in ring 23, one step above (23, −22) = 2026, so (23, −21) = 2027.

7) (22, −21).  
   Since max|22|,|−21| = 22, it is in ring 22.  
   Ring 22 starts at (22, −21) = 1850 (the first square in that ring),  
   so (22, −21) = 1850.

8) (22, −23).  
   This is also ring 23 along the bottom edge.  
   The bottom edge of ring 23 runs from (−23, −23) up to (23, −23) = 2209 in ascending order.  
   Counting across shows that (22, −23) = 2208.

Summarizing:

  (22, −23) = 2208  
  (23, −23) = 2209  
  (24, −23) = 2210  
  (24, −22) = 2211  
  (24, −21) = 2212  
  (23, −21) = 2027  
  (22, −21) = 1850  
  (22, −22) = 2025  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3)  The sum of those eight neighbors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Add them all:

  2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212
    + 2027 + 2025 + 1850
  = 16952.

Hence, the required sum of the eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.
