A concise way to see why the answer is 16 952 is to work in “spiral‐coordinate” form, where the center 1 sits at (0, 0), and each integer n lives at some integer lattice point (x, y).  In the standard outward spiral

 •  1 is at (0, 0),  
 •  2 is at (1, 0),  
 • 3 is at (1, 1),  
 • 4 at (0, 1), 5 at (−1, 1), 6 at (−1, 0), 7 at (−1, −1), etc.,  

one finds that the “bottom‐right corner” of the k th “ring” is the point  
( k , −k ),  
and that corner holds the value  
(2k + 1)².  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Locate 2025 and 2026 in coordinates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 2025 = 45², it sits at the bottom‐right corner of the ring of radius k = 22,  
so  
  2025 is at (22, −22).  

Next ring (k = 23) has bottom‐right corner (23, −23) with value 47² = 2209, so the numbers 2026 through 2209 form that (23 rd) ring.  In this spiral convention, when you “finish” ring 22 at (22, −22) = 2025, you then step outward in the +x‐direction by 1 to begin ring 23.  Hence

  2026 is at (23, −22).  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) The eight neighbors of (23, −22)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A cell’s eight neighbors are the points (x±1, y±1) and (x±0, y±1), etc.  Concretely, for center (23, −22) they are:

  (22, −23),  (23, −23),  (24, −23),
  (22, −22),              (24, −22),
  (22, −21),  (23, −21),  (24, −21).

We determine each neighbor’s ring and its spiral value.

–––––
(a) (23, −23).  
    This is the bottom‐right corner of ring 23, so it is 47² = 2209.

(b) (22, −23).  
    Still max(|22|, |−23|) = 23, so it is on ring 23’s bottom edge.  
    On each ring n, the bottom edge runs from (−n, −n) up to (n, −n) in ascending order.  
    Hence moving one step left from (23, −23) = 2209 gives 2208.  

(c) (24, −23).  
    Now max(|24|, |−23|) = 24⇒ring 24.  
    Its bottom‐right corner is (24, −24) = 49² = 2401, so that corner is the last value of ring 24.  
    The first value of ring 24 is 2209 + 1 = 2210, at (24, −23).  
    So S(24, −23) = 2210.

(d) (22, −22).  
    That is exactly the bottom‐right corner of ring 22 = (22, −22), holding 45² = 2025.

(e) (24, −22).  
    Again ring 24.  Having found that (24, −23) = 2210, one step “up” along the right side adds 1,  
    so S(24, −22) = 2211.

(f) (22, −21).  
    This lies on ring 22 (since max(|22|, 21) = 22).  
    One checks that the “right side” of ring 22 goes from (22, −21) up to (22, 22).  
    The first value on ring 22 is (2·22−1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850.  
    Hence S(22, −21) = 1850.

(g) (23, −21).  
    Ring 23.  Its right side goes from (23, −22) = 2026 upwards.  
    So the next step is 2027 at (23, −21).

(h) (24, −21).  
    Ring 24 again.  We already found (24, −23) = 2210, (24, −22) = 2211, so now (24, −21) = 2212.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Summation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collecting those eight neighbor‐values:

 • (22, −23) → 2208  
 • (23, −23) → 2209  
 • (24, −23) → 2210  
 • (22, −22) → 2025  
 • (24, −22) → 2211  
 • (22, −21) → 1850  
 • (23, −21) → 2027  
 • (24, −21) → 2212  

Their sum is

  2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212  
 = 16 952.

Therefore, the required sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 in the spiral is 16 952.
