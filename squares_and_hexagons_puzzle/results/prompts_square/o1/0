First, let us pin down where 2026 sits in the standard “Ulam spiral” (the one that starts at 1 in the center, goes 2 to the right, then winds outward clockwise).  In that spiral:

• 1 is at (0,0).  
• 2 is at (1,0).  
• 3 is at (1,1).  
• 4 is at (0,1).  
• 5 is at (−1,1),  
… and so on, spiraling outward.

A well‐known fact about this spiral is that the odd squares (1, 9, 25, 49,  …) appear at coordinates (k, −k).  In particular,  
(2k+1)²  is located at (k, −k).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Identifying the coordinate of 2026
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 45² = 2025, and 47² = 2209, the numbers from 2026 up to 2209 lie on the “ring” whose “radius” is 23.  In the Ulam spiral, the point (k, −k) = (22, −22) holds 45² = 2025.  Consequently, the very next number, 2026, sits one unit farther out in the +x‐direction:

• 2025 is at (22, −22).  
• Therefore 2026 is at (23, −22).

Hence the coordinate of 2026 is (23, −22).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)  The eight neighbors of (23, −22)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a square grid, the eight neighbors of (x, y) are the points

 (x−1, y−1),  (x, y−1),  (x+1, y−1),
 (x−1, y),                (x+1, y),
 (x−1, y+1),  (x, y+1),  (x+1, y+1).

So for (23, −22), its neighbors are:

1) (22, −23)  
2) (23, −23)  
3) (24, −23)  
4) (22, −22)  
5) (24, −22)  
6) (22, −21)  
7) (23, −21)  
8) (24, −21)

We must find the spiral‐labels (the natural numbers) at each of those eight coordinates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)  Assigning the spiral values to those neighbors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a)  Neighbors that lie on ring 23

Ring 23 runs from 2026 up to 47² = 2209.  In the Ulam spiral, the largest number on ring 23 (2209) sits at its “corner” (23, −23).  One can check (by tracing around the ring in clockwise order) that:

 • (23, −23) = 2209  
 • Moving one step left to (22, −23) = 2208  
 • Meanwhile, starting from (23, −22) = 2026 and going one step up:  
   (23, −21) = 2027  

Hence on ring 23 we get:  
 • (22, −23) → 2208  
 • (23, −23) → 2209  
 • (23, −21) → 2027  

(b)  Neighbors that lie on ring 22

Ring 22 runs from 1850 up to 45² = 2025.  Indeed, its outer‐corner (last number on that ring) is (22, −22) = 2025.  By examining how ring 22 is laid out, one finds that (22, −21) is actually the start of that ring and must be 1850.  So:

 • (22, −22) = 2025  
 • (22, −21) = 1850  

(c)  Neighbors that lie on ring 24

Ring 24 goes from 2209+1 = 2210 up to 49² = 2401.  Its starting edge (in the standard spiral ordering) is at (24, −23) = 2210, then moving upward:

 • (24, −23) = 2210  
 • (24, −22) = 2211  
 • (24, −21) = 2212  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)  Summing those eight values
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collecting them all:

1) (22, −23) = 2208  
2) (23, −23) = 2209  
3) (24, −23) = 2210  
4) (22, −22) = 2025  
5) (24, −22) = 2211  
6) (22, −21) = 1850  
7) (23, −21) = 2027  
8) (24, −21) = 2212  

Their sum is:

2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212  
= 16952  

Therefore, the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is 16952.
