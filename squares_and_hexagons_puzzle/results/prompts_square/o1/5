First, let us pin down how the spiral is laid out.  From the snippet

  …  5   4   3  …
  …  6   1   2  …
  …  7   8   9  …

we see that  
• 1 is at (0,0),  
• 2 is at (1,0),  
• 3 is at (1,1),  
• 4 is at (0,1),  
• 5 is at (−1,1),  
and so on, with coordinates increasing “counterclockwise.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Locating 2026
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A standard fact (read off small cases) is that odd squares n² lie at the bottom‐right “corner” in this spiral at the coordinates

  ( (n−1)/2,  −(n−1)/2 ).

For example:  
• 3² = 9 is at (1, −1),  
• 5² = 25 is at (2, −2),  
• 7² = 49 is at (3, −3), etc.

Since 45² = 2025, that places 2025 at

  ( (45−1)/2,  −(45−1)/2 ) = (22, −22).

Hence 2025 is the end of the “ring” whose side is 45×45.  The very next integer, 2026, must begin the next ring (whose side is 47×47).  In this counterclockwise layout, after an odd square (an outer corner), we move one step “to the right” to start the next layer.  Consequently,

  2026 is at (23, −22).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) The eight neighbors around 2026
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The eight neighbors of the grid‐cell (x,y) are the coordinates

  (x−1, y−1),  (x, y−1),  (x+1, y−1),
  (x+1, y    ),            (x+1, y+1),
  (x,   y+1),  (x−1, y+1), (x−1, y   ).

So for (23, −22), the neighbors are

  1. (22, −23)
  2. (23, −23)
  3. (24, −23)
  4. (24, −22)
  5. (24, −21)
  6. (23, −21)
  7. (22, −21)
  8. (22, −22).

We must find which numbers the spiral assigns to these coordinates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Computing each neighbor’s value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spiral can be broken into “rings,” where ring r is all points whose maximum coordinate‐magnitude is r.  In particular,  
• ring r has outer side‐length 2r+1,  
• it runs from (2r−1)²+1 up to (2r+1)².

Below is a concise lookup for each of the eight neighbors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(A)  (22, −23).  Here  r = max(|22|, |−23|) = 23,  so it lies in ring 23.  
    Ring 23 runs from 2026 up to 47² = 2209.  
    One finds (22, −23) very near the bottom edge of that ring.  
    A careful step‐count around that ring shows (22, −23) = 2208.

(B)  (23, −23).  Same ring 23, but actually the bottom‐right corner of it,  
    i.e.  (23, −23) = (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209.

(C)  (24, −23).  Now r = 24;  that is ring 24, which begins at 47²+1=2210.  
    In fact the “first coordinate” in ring‐24 is  (24, −23).  
    Hence (24, −23) = 2210.

(D)  (24, −22).  Still ring 24.  Moving one step “up” from the start of ring 24    
    increases the label by 1, so (24, −22) = 2211.

(E)  (24, −21).  Ring 24 again, two steps up from its start ⇒ 2212.

(F)  (23, −21).  Here r = 23, so back to ring 23.  
    Counting upward from (23, −22) = 2026 gives (23, −21) = 2027.

(G)  (22, −21).  Now r = max(|22|, |−21|) = 22, so ring 22.  
    Ring 22 starts at 43²+1 = 1849+1 = 1850,  
    and its “first coordinate” is (22, −21), so that cell = 1850.

(H)  (22, −22).  Also in ring 22.  
    In fact for ring 22 the bottom‐right corner is (22, −22) = 45² = 2025.

Putting these together:

  (22, −23) → 2208
  (23, −23) → 2209
  (24, −23) → 2210
  (24, −22) → 2211
  (24, −21) → 2212
  (23, −21) → 2027
  (22, −21) → 1850
  (22, −22) → 2025

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Summing them up
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sum = 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2027 + 1850 + 2025.

A convenient grouping is:

• 2208 + 2212 = 4420  
• 2209 + 2211 = 4420  
• 4420 + 4420 = 8840  
• Add 2210 ⇒ 11050  
• Add 2027 ⇒ 13077  
• Add 1850 ⇒ 14927  
• Add 2025 ⇒ 16952  

Hence the total is 16,952.

Answer: 16952.
