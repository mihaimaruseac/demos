First, we must locate 2026 in the standard “outward‐spiral” numbering on the integer grid.  In that spiral:

• 1 sits at the origin (0,0).  
• 2 lies immediately to the right at (1,0).  
• Numbers then spiral outward, ring by ring, in a clockwise fashion.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Determining which “ring” contains 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The kth “ring” in this spiral consists of the numbers from  
(2k−1)² + 1   up to   (2k+1)².  

Since (2k+1)² must be ≥ 2026, observe that  
   45² = 2025   and   47² = 2209.  
Hence 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, so 2026 lies in ring 23 (whose largest number is 47² = 2209).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Coordinates of 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By standard spiral conventions, ring k has outer “radius” k in both x and y.  Its largest corner, (2k+1)², sits at (k, −k).  For k = 23:

• The biggest number in ring 23 is 47² = 2209 at (23, −23).  
• The ring 23 numbers run from 2026 up to 2209 around the perimeter x,y ∈ [−23..23].  

In fact, the ring “starts” at the point (23, −(k−1)) = (23, −22) with the value 2026.  So  
   2026  is at  (23, −22).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Finding the eight neighbors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A cell’s eight neighbors are the squares immediately above, below, left, right, and on the four diagonals.  Denoting our central cell by (23, −22), the neighbors are:

(1)  (23, −21)   “up”
(2)  (23, −23)   “down”
(3)  (22, −22)   “left”
(4)  (24, −22)   “right”
(5)  (22, −21)   “up–left diagonal”
(6)  (24, −21)   “up–right diagonal”
(7)  (22, −23)   “down–left diagonal”
(8)  (24, −23)   “down–right diagonal”

We now determine each of their spiral values:

• (23, −21) is immediately one step “up” from (23, −22)=2026 along ring 23,  
  so it is 2027.

• (23, −23) is the lower‐right corner of ring 23, which is 2209.

• (22, −22) lies in ring 22 and in fact is that ring’s bottom‐right corner, 2025.

• (22, −21) is one step “inside” ring 22, on its right edge.  By careful ring‐22 labeling,  
  (22, −21) = 1850.

• (22, −23) is on the bottom edge of ring 23.  Tracing that edge shows (22, −23) = 2208.

• (24, −22), (24, −21), (24, −23) all belong to ring 24.  One can check that ring 24  
  begins at (24, −23) = 2210, then moves upward along x=24.  Hence:  
    – (24, −23) = 2210  
    – (24, −22) = 2211  
    – (24, −21) = 2212.

Summarizing:

  (23, −21) → 2027  
  (23, −23) → 2209  
  (22, −22) → 2025  
  (22, −21) → 1850  
  (22, −23) → 2208  
  (24, −22) → 2211  
  (24, −21) → 2212  
  (24, −23) → 2210  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Summing these eight neighbors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  2027 + 2209 + 2025 + 1850  
+ 2208 + 2211 + 2212 + 2210  
= 16952.

Hence, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 in the spiral is 16952.
