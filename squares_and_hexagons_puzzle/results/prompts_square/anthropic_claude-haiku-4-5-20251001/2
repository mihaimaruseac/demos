I need to find the number 2026 in the spiral and sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 goes right
- 3 goes up
- 4 goes left
- 5 goes left
- 6 goes down
- 7 goes down
- 8 goes right
- 9 goes right
- 10 goes right

The pattern involves moving in directions: Right, Up, Left, Left, Down, Down, Right, Right, Right, Up, Up, Up, ...

The spiral moves in a pattern where we go:
- Right 1 step
- Up 1 step
- Left 2 steps
- Down 2 steps
- Right 3 steps
- Up 3 steps
- Left 4 steps
- Down 4 steps
- etc.

Let me find which "ring" 2026 is in. The spiral completes square rings around the center.

Ring n (where ring 0 is just the number 1) ends at (2n+1)².
- Ring 0 ends at 1
- Ring 1 ends at 9 = 3²
- Ring 2 ends at 25 = 5²
- Ring 3 ends at 49 = 7²
- Ring 4 ends at 81 = 9²
- Ring 5 ends at 121 = 11²
- Ring 6 ends at 169 = 13²
- ...
- Ring 44 ends at 89² = 7921
- Ring 45 ends at 91² = 8281

Since √2026 ≈ 45.01, we have 44² = 1936 < 2026 < 2025 = 45².

Actually, let me recalculate: 45² = 2025, so 2026 is in ring 45, just past the end of ring 44.

Ring 44 ends at 89² = 7921... that's too big. Let me recalculate.

If ring n ends at (2n+1)²:
- For (2n+1)² = 2025, we need 2n+1 = 45, so n = 22.
- Ring 22 ends at 45² = 2025

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

The spiral at the end of ring 22 (at 2025) is at position (22, 22) if we put 1 at origin (0,0).

Ring 22 ends at the bottom-right, and the spiral continues upward along the right edge. So 2026 is directly above 2025.

If 2025 = 45² is at position (22, 22), then 2026 is at position (22, 23).

Now I need to find all 8 neighbors of position (22, 23):
- (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24)
- (22, 22), (22, 24)
- (23, 22), (23, 23), (23, 24)

I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

The number at position (x, y) in the spiral can be computed, but let me use a key property: for any number n, the sum of all 8 neighbors equals the sum of numbers in a specific pattern around it.

**Key insight:** For the square spiral, there's a useful property. If we sum all 8 neighbors of a number n, we can find this by looking at the structure.

However, a more direct approach: Let's call the position of 2025 as center. Then:
- 2025 is at some position
- 2026 is directly above it
- The 8 neighbors of 2026 are symmetric around it

For large n in the spiral, the neighbors approximately sum to 8n. More precisely, the sum of the 8 neighbors of n is related to the position in the spiral.

By the properties of the square spiral, if n is in the spiral at position (x,y), the 8 neighbors sum to a value that can be computed.

Let me use coordinates with 1 at origin. The position (22, 23) is on the right edge moving up.

The sum of 8 neighbors around any number n in this spiral is always 8n + (constant related to position).

For a number well into the spiral at position (22, 23):
The 8 neighbors are: 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, and 4 others...

Actually: The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
2025 (below), 2027, 2028, ... (on the spiral)

By a known property of the square spiral: **the sum of the 8 neighbors of any interior point equals 8 times that number plus a small correction, but more directly:** 

The 8 neighbors of 2026 sum to: 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + ... going around.

After careful analysis of the spiral pattern, the sum of 8 neighbors of 2026 is:
