I need to find the position of 2026 on the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

**Understanding the spiral pattern:**

The spiral starts at 1 and moves: right (1→2), down (2→3), left (3→4, 4→5), up (5→6), right (6→7, 7→8, 7→9), and so on.

The pattern forms square rings around the center:
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 8n numbers

**Finding which ring contains 2026:**

Ring n ends at number $(2n+1)^2$.

- Ring 44 ends at $(2·44+1)^2 = 89^2 = 7921$
- Ring 45 ends at $(2·45+1)^2 = 91^2 = 8281$

Since 2026 < 7921, it's in ring 44 or earlier.

- Ring 43 ends at $87^2 = 7569$
- Ring 44 ends at $89^2 = 7921$

Since 2026 < 7569, let me check ring 42:
- Ring 42 ends at $85^2 = 7225$

Continuing backwards:
- Ring 22 ends at $45^2 = 2025$
- Ring 23 ends at $47^2 = 2209$

So 2026 is in ring 23.

**Locating 2026 within ring 23:**

Ring 22 ends at 2025, so 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

Each ring starts on the right side, moving right from the previous ring's end position. Ring 23 starts right after 2025.

In the spiral:
- Ring 22 ends at the bottom-right corner at position (22, -22)
- Ring 23 begins moving right from there

The right side of ring 23 moves up from (23, -22) to (23, 23): that's 46 numbers (2026-2071)
The top side moves left: (23, 23) to (-23, 23): that's 46 numbers (2072-2117)
The left side moves down: (-23, 23) to (-23, -23): that's 46 numbers (2118-2163)
The bottom side moves right: (-23, -23) to (23, -23): that's 46 numbers (2164-2209)

Since 2026 is the 1st number in ring 23, starting at position (23, -22), and it moves upward on the right side:
- Position of 2026: (23, -22)

**Finding the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):**

The 8 neighbors are at positions:
- (22, -22), (22, -21), (23, -21)
- (24, -22), (24, -21), (24, -23)
- (23, -23), (22, -23)

**Finding the numbers at these positions:**

I need to trace which numbers land at each position. 

At (23, -22): this is 2026 itself.

Just before 2026 at position (23, -23): This is 2025 (the end of ring 22)

Moving up the right side of ring 23 from (23, -22):
- (23, -21): 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (23, -20): 2026 + 2 = 2028
...continuing upward...

Moving inward from (23, -22) toward ring 22:
- (22, -22): end of ring 22 = 2025
- (22, -21): In ring 22, on its right side going up: $45^2 - 45 + 1 = 2025 - 45 + 1 = 1981$

Let me use the formula more carefully. For ring $n$:
- Right side (going up): positions $(n, -n)$ to $(n, n)$
- Top side (going left): positions $(n, n)$ to $(-n, n)$  
- Left side (going down): positions $(-n, n)$ to $(-n, -n)$
- Bottom side (going right): positions $(-n, -n)$ to $(n, -n)$

The 8 neighbors of (23, -22) are:
- (24, -23), (24, -22), (24, -21): in ring 24
- (23, -23), (23, -21): in ring 23
- (22, -23), (22, -22), (22, -21): in ring 22

For ring 23: (23, -21) = 2026 + 1 = 2027; (23, -23) = 2025

For ring 22 (ends at 2025): The right side goes from (22, -22) to (22, 22).
- (22, -22) = 2025 - 45 + 1 = 1981
- (22, -21) = 1982
- (22, -23) is outside ring 22 in the (bottom-right corner)

For ring 24 (starts at 2210): (24, -23) = 2209; (24, -22) = 2208; (24, -21) = 2207

**Sum of neighbors:**
$2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1982 + 2209 + 2208 + 2207 + 2026 = 16265$

Wait, I shouldn't include 2026 itself. The 8 neighbors sum is:
$$2025 + 2027 + 1981 + 1982 + 2209 + 2208 + 2207 = \boxed{16239}$$
