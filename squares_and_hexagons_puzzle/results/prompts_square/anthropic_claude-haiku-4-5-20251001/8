I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1, it goes:
- 1 (center)
- 2 (right)
- 3,4,5 (up, left, left)
- 6,7,8,9 (down, down, right, right)
- 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 (up, up, up, left, left, left, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right)

The spiral moves in a pattern: right 1, up 1, left 2, down 2, right 3, up 3, left 4, down 4, ...

For each complete "ring" around the center, the spiral goes:
- Right k steps
- Up k steps  
- Left k+1 steps
- Down k+1 steps

Let me find which ring 2026 is in. After ring n, we've placed numbers up to (2n+1)².

- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 1-9, so (2·1+1)² = 9
- Ring 2: ends at (2·2+1)² = 25
- Ring 3: ends at (2·3+1)² = 49
- Ring 4: ends at (2·4+1)² = 81
- Ring 5: ends at (2·5+1)² = 121
- Ring 6: ends at (2·6+1)² = 169
- Ring 7: ends at (2·7+1)² = 225
- Ring 8: ends at (2·8+1)² = 289
- ...
- Ring 31: ends at (2·31+1)² = 63² = 3969
- Ring 30: ends at (2·30+1)² = 61² = 3721

Since 2026 is between 1849 (43²) and 2025 (45²), let me recalculate:
- Ring 21: (2·21+1)² = 43² = 1849
- Ring 22: (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23: (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in ring 22, just after 2025.

Ring 22 starts at 1850 (which is 1849 + 1). Ring 22 begins by moving right.

Position in ring 22: 2026 - 1849 = 177

The sequence in ring 22 starting from 1850:
- Right 22 steps: 1850-1871
- Up 22 steps: 1872-1893
- Left 23 steps: 1894-1916
- Down 23 steps: 1917-1939
- Right 23 steps: 1940-1962
- Up 23 steps: 1963-1985
- Left 24 steps: 1986-2009
- Down 24 steps: 2010-2033

Position 177:
- Positions 1-22: right (1850-1871)
- Positions 23-44: up (1872-1893)
- Positions 45-67: left (1894-1916)
- Positions 68-90: down (1917-1939)
- Positions 91-113: right (1940-1962)
- Positions 114-136: up (1963-1985)
- Positions 137-160: left (1986-2009)
- Positions 161-184: down (2010-2033)

Position 177 is in the "down" section: 177 - 160 = 17, so it's the 17th number down in that section.
2010 + 16 = 2026 ✓

In coordinate form, starting with 1 at (0,0):
- Ring 22 starts at (22, -21) after completing the previous ring at (21, -21)

After "right 22": end at (22, -21)
After "up 22": end at (22, 0)
After "left 23": end at (-1, 0)
After "down 23": end at (-1, -23)
After "right 23": end at (22, -23)
After "up 23": end at (22, 0)
After "left 24": end at (-2, 0)
After "down 17": end at (-2, -17)

So 2026 is at position (-2, -17).

The 8 neighbors are at positions:
(-3,-18), (-2,-18), (-1,-18), (-3,-17), (-1,-17), (-3,-16), (-2,-16), (-1,-16)

These correspond to numbers: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2025, 2027, 2041, 2042, 2043

Sum = 2009 + 2010 + 2011 + 2025 + 2027 + 2041 + 2042 + 2043 = **16208**
