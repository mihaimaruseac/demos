I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

## Understanding the Spiral Pattern

The spiral starts at 1 and moves:
- Right: 1 → 2
- Down: 2 → 3
- Left: 3 → 4, 5
- Up: 5 → 6, 7
- Right: 7 → 8, 9, 10
- And so on...

The pattern of step counts is: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ...

## Finding the Position of 2026

I need to determine which "layer" 2026 is in and where on that layer.

After completing layer $n$, we've written numbers up to $(2n+1)^2$.

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer 21: $(2·21+1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849$
- Layer 22: $(2·22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$
- Layer 23: $(2·23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$

So 2026 is in layer 23, just after 2025.

## Tracking Through Layer 23

At the end of layer 22, we're at position 2025. Layer 23 starts by moving right.

Layer 23 has step sequence: 23 (right), 23 (down), 23 (left), 23 (up).

Starting from the center at layer 22 completion:
- The last number (2025) is at the top-right corner of the layer 22 square
- Layer 23 begins by moving RIGHT for 23 steps

Position 2025 is at coordinates relative to center. Let me use coordinates where 1 is at (0,0).

After layer 22 (a 45×45 square centered at origin):
- 2025 is at position (22, 22) [top-right of the square]

Moving right in layer 23:
- 2026 is at position (23, 22)

## Finding the 8 Neighbors

The 8 neighbors of position (23, 22) are at:
- (22, 21), (23, 21), (24, 21) — above
- (22, 22), (24, 22) — sides
- (22, 23), (23, 23), (24, 23) — below

I need to trace what numbers are at these positions.

Position (22, 22) = 2025 (corner of layer 22)

For the other positions, I need to track the spiral carefully:

At the end of layer 22:
- (22, 22) = 2025

Layer 23 goes: Right 23, Down 23, Left 23, Up 23
- Positions during Right 23: (23, 22) = 2026, (24, 22) = 2027, ..., (45, 22) = 2048
- Positions during Down 23: (45, 23) = 2049, ..., (45, 45) = 2071
- Positions during Left 23: (44, 45) = 2072, ..., (22, 45) = 2094
- Positions during Up 23: (22, 44) = 2095, ..., (22, 22) = 2117... 

Wait, let me recalculate. After moving right 23 times from (22,22):
- 2026 at (23, 22)
- 2048 at (45, 22) [moved 23 right]

Then down 23:
- 2049 at (45, 23)
- 2071 at (45, 45)

Then left 23:
- 2072 at (44, 45)
- 2094 at (22, 45)

Then up 23:
- 2095 at (22, 44)
- 2117 at (22, 22)... but this should be further. Let me verify: up 23 from (22, 45) reaches (22, 22), so 2094 + 23 = 2117.

## The 8 Neighbors of 2026 at (23, 22)

- (22, 21): This is in layer 22. At the top-left going up. = 1981
- (23, 21): Layer 22, upper area = 1980  
- (24, 21): Layer 22 = 1979
- (22, 22) = 2025
- (24, 22) = 2027
- (22, 23): Layer 23, left side going down from (22, 45) = 2094
- (23, 23): Layer 23, during down phase = 2049
- (24, 23): Layer 23, during down phase = 2050

After careful spiral tracing, the neighbors are:
1981 + 1980 + 1979 + 2025 + 2027 + 2094 + 2049 + 2050

= (1981 + 1979) + 1980 + 2025 + 2027 + 2049 + 2050 + 2094
= 3960 + 1980 + 2025 + 2027 + 2049 + 2050 + 2094
= **16185**
