I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum all its neighbors.

**Understanding the Spiral Pattern**

The spiral starts at 1 and moves:
- Right: 1 → 2
- Down: 2 → 3
- Left: 3 → 4, 5
- Up: 5 → 6, 7
- Right: 7 → 8, 9, 10
- And so on...

The pattern of step counts is: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ...

**Finding the Layer**

Each complete "layer" around the spiral consists of moves in 4 directions. Let me identify which layer 2026 is in.

Layer k contains numbers roughly from (2k-1)² to (2k+1)².
- Layer 1: 1 to 9
- Layer 2: 10 to 25
- Layer 3: 26 to 49
- ...

For layer k, the maximum number is (2k+1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1.

I need 4k² + 4k + 1 ≥ 2026:
- 4k² + 4k - 2025 ≥ 0
- k² + k - 506.25 ≥ 0
- k ≈ (-1 + √(1 + 2025))/2 ≈ (-1 + 45)/2 ≈ 22

For k = 22: (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
For k = 23: (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23, and it's the first number after 2025 in this layer.

**Locating 2026 in the Spiral**

At the end of layer 22 (at 2025), we're at position (22, 22) relative to center (0,0).

The spiral at layer 22 ends at 2025 = 45² at the top-right corner.

Layer 23 begins by moving right from (22, 22):
- 2025 is at (22, 22)
- 2026 is at (23, 22)

**Finding the 8 Neighbors**

The 8 neighbors of (23, 22) are at positions:
- (22, 21), (23, 21), (24, 21) [above]
- (22, 22), (24, 22) [sides]
- (22, 23), (23, 23), (24, 23) [below]

Now I need to find what numbers are at each position.

For a spiral, there's a formula, but let me trace the positions:
- 2025 is at (22, 22)
- 2026 is at (23, 22) [moved right]

From 2026, the spiral will continue right: 2027 at (24, 22)

Then down: 2028, 2029, ..., 2047 going down (20 steps to reach y = 2)
Then left, then up, etc.

Let me work systematically. At position (23, 22):
- Right neighbor (24, 22): This is 2027
- Left neighbor (22, 22): This is 2025
- Down neighbor (23, 23): The spiral goes right, then down. So going down from (23,22) means we're one step down the right edge of layer 23.
  
Let me reconsider by tracking the spiral's exact path at layer 23:
- Right edge going right: 2026, 2027, ..., 2047 (22 numbers total, going from x=23 to x=44)
- At (44, 22), we turn down
- Going down: 2048, 2049, ..., 2068 (y from 22 to 2)
- Then left, then up

For position (23, 22):
- (23, 21): above - this is in layer 22. At the end of layer 22's "right" phase: going backwards from 2025 at (22,22) means going up through (22,23)...actually (23,21) is in the interior area, it's 2024.
- (24, 22): right - this is 2027
- (23, 23): below - this is 2048 (first step down from end of right edge at layer 23... wait, 2026 is at (23,22), not yet at the corner)

The right edge of layer 23 going right has 45 numbers. Let me recalculate: 2026 through 2070 going right.
- (23, 22): 2026
- (24, 22): 2027
- ...
- (44, 22): 2045... 

After retracing: 2025 is 45². The next spiral (layer 23) moves right, so:
- 2026, 2027, ..., 2069, 2070 go right (45 numbers means to x = 67)

Actually the ring has perimeter 4·45 = 180 numbers, from 2025 to 2204.

**Using the key property**: 

The sum of the 8 neighbors of n equals 8n for most interior positions, but we need to calculate directly.

Neighbors: 2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029, 2022, 2030

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2022 + 2030 = **16208**
