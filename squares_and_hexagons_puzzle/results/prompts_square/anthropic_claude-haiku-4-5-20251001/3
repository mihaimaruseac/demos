I need to find the position of 2026 on the spiral and then sum all 8 neighbors.

**Understanding the spiral pattern:**

The spiral starts at 1 and moves:
- Right: 1 → 2
- Down: 2 → 3
- Left: 3 → 4, 5
- Up: 5 → 6, 7
- Right: 7 → 8, 9, 10
- And so on...

The pattern of moves is: R(1), D(1), L(2), U(2), R(3), D(3), L(4), U(4), ...

Each pair of directions increases the step count: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...

**Finding the position of 2026:**

Let me track which "ring" 2026 is in. The spiral completes rings:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring n: contains 8n numbers

Total numbers through ring n: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8·n(n+1)/2 = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n² + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)²

So ring n ends at (2n+1)².

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 22 ends at: (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23 ends at: (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in ring 23, and it's the 1st number of that ring.

**Position on the spiral:**

Ring 23 starts after position 2025. The spiral at the end of ring 22 (at 2025 = 45²) is at position (22, 22) if we center at origin with 1 at (0,0).

For odd ring ends: ring n ends at the bottom-right corner at position (n, -n).

So 2025 is at position (22, -22).

The spiral moves right first in ring 23. So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

**Finding the 8 neighbors of (23, -22):**

The 8 neighbors are at positions:
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)
- (22, -22), (24, -22)
- (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)

**Converting positions back to numbers:**

For a position (x, y) in ring n = max(|x|, |y|), I need to trace the spiral.

Actually, let me use a different approach. For ring n centered at origin:
- Ring n starts at (2n-1)² + 1
- The ring goes: Right along bottom, then Up along right side, then Left along top, then Down along left side

For ring 23 starting at 2026 at position (23, -22):
- The ring starts at the position after 2025 = 45²
- Position 2025 is at (22, -22)
- Position 2026 is one step right: (23, -22)

Let me calculate each neighbor systematically by determining their position numbers:

At ring 23, position (23, -22):
- The bottom-right is (23, -23): this is position 2025 + 23 = 2048
- Moving right corner: (24, -23): position 2049
- (24, -22): position 2050
- (24, -21): position 2051
- Top area (23, -21): position 2052
- (22, -21): position 2051... 

Let me recalculate more carefully by tracing ring 23:
Ring 23 begins at 2026 at (23, -22) and goes right.

Following the spiral counterclockwise starting from (23,-22):
- Right along y = -23: positions 2026...2048 (23 positions)
- Up along x = 24: positions 2049...2071 (23 positions)  
- Left along y = 22: positions 2072...2094 (23 positions)
- Down along x = 22: positions 2095...2116 (22 positions)

So the neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23): 2025
- (23, -23): 2048
- (24, -23): 2049
- (24, -22): 2050
- (24, -21): 2051
- (23, -21): 2052
- (22, -21): 2051... 

Wait, let me reconsider. (22,-21) is in ring 22. Ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22,-22). Going backwards: (22,-21) is position 2024.

The 8 neighbors and their values:
- (22, -23): 2025 - 1 = 2024
- (23, -23): 2048
- (24, -23): 2049
- (24, -22): 2050
- (24, -21): 2051
- (23, -21): 2052
- (22, -21): 2024
- (22, -22): 2025

Sum = 2024 + 2048 + 2049 + 2050 + 2051 + 2052 + 2024 + 2025 = **16273**
