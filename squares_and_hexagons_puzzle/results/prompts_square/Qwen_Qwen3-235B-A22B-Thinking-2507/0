To determine the sum of all **8 neighbors** of the number **2026** in the spiral grid, we follow a systematic approach based on the structure and progression of the number spiral.

### 🌀 Understanding the Spiral Structure

The numbers are laid out in a square spiral starting from 1 at the center `(0, 0)`:

- The **first layer (k=0)** contains only the number 1.
- The **k-th layer (k ≥ 1)** consists of all points where the maximum absolute value of x or y is k. It spans from `(2k - 1)^2 + 1` to `(2k + 1)^2`.

Each layer has **8k numbers**, and the four sides of the layer have **2k numbers each**:
- **Right side**: x = k, y from -k+1 to k
- **Top side**: y = k, x from k-1 to -k
- **Left side**: x = -k, y from k-1 to -k
- **Bottom side**: y = -k, x from -k+1 to k

### 🔍 Locating the Number 2026

We find the square nearest to 2026:

$$
\sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01 \Rightarrow 45^2 = 2025
$$

So,
- `E(22) = (2×22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025`
- Therefore, **2026 = S(23)** — the **start of layer k=23**

For **layer k**, the starting point is at:
$$
(x, y) = (k, -k + 1)
$$
Thus for **k = 23**:
$$
(x, y) = (23, -22)
$$

This confirms that **2026 is located at (23, -22)**.

### 🧮 Finding the 8 Neighbors

From this position, the 8 neighbors are the surrounding coordinates:
| Neighbor Type | Coordinates |
|---------------|-------------|
| Top-left      | (22, -21)   |
| Top           | (23, -21)   |
| Top-right     | (24, -21)   |
| Left          | (22, -22)   |
| Right         | (24, -22)   |
| Bottom-left   | (22, -23)   |
| Bottom        | (23, -23)   |
| Bottom-right  | (24, -23)   |

For each neighbor coordinate, we determine which **layer k** it belongs to, then compute its **number n** using the spiral formula:
$$
n = (2k - 1)^2 + 1 + \text{offset}
$$
where the offset is determined by the **side** and **position within the side**.

After computing each neighbor’s number, we get the following values:

| Coordinate | n Value |
|------------|----------|
| (22, -21)  | 1850     |
| (23, -21)  | 2027     |
| (24, -21)  | 2212     |
| (22, -22)  | 2025     |
| (24, -22)  | 2211     |
| (22, -23)  | 2208     |
| (23, -23)  | 2209     |
| (24, -23)  | 2210     |

### ✅ Final Calculation

Now, summing all 8 neighbor values:

$$
1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952
$$

This can also be verified through various grouping methods and step-by-step addition to ensure accuracy.

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{16952}
