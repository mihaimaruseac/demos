To solve the problem, we are given a square spiral maze where numbers are laid out starting from the center (1) and spiraling outward in a clockwise direction. The number **2026** is located at a specific position in this grid, and our goal is to compute the **sum of all 8 neighbors** around it.

### Step 1: Determine the Layer of 2026

In a square spiral:

- The **last number** in layer $ k $ is $(2k + 1)^2$
- The **first number** in layer $ k $ is $(2k - 1)^2 + 1$

We find the smallest integer $ k $ such that:
$$
(2k - 1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2k + 1)^2
$$

Compute square roots:

- $ \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01 $
- So $ 2k + 1 = 45 \Rightarrow k = 22 $, but then:
  - $ (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 $
  - $ (2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 $

Thus, **2026 is the first number of layer 23**, since:
$$
2026 = (2 \cdot 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1
$$

This means the **center cell (2026)** is at:
$$
(x, y) = (23, -22)
$$
which corresponds to the **start of the east side** of layer 23.

### Step 2: Find All 8 Neighbors and Their Values

Using the known structure of the spiral grid and the coordinate-to-number mapping for each layer, we determine the exact values of the 8 neighbors. Below is a summary of the neighbors with their coordinates and computed values:

| Direction   | Coordinates | Value |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| North       | (23, -21)   | 2027  |
| Northeast   | (24, -21)   | 2212  |
| East        | (24, -22)   | 2211  |
| Southeast   | (24, -23)   | 2210  |
| South       | (23, -23)   | 2209  |
| Southwest   | (22, -23)   | 2208  |
| West        | (22, -22)   | 2025  |
| Northwest   | (22, -21)   | 1850  |

These values were confirmed using precise formulas derived from the spiral's construction rules, including side-specific expressions based on the current layer and relative position along the side.

### Step 3: Compute the Sum of the Neighbors

Grouping the values for easier arithmetic:

- **Southwest (2208), South (2209), Southeast (2210), East (2211), Northeast (2212):**
  These form a sequence of consecutive integers:  
  $$
  2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 5 \times 2210 = 11050
  $$

- **North (2027), West (2025):**
  $$
  2027 + 2025 = 4052
  $$

- **Northwest (1850):**
  $$
  1850
  $$

Now sum all together:
$$
11050 + 4052 + 1850 = 16952
$$

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{16952}
