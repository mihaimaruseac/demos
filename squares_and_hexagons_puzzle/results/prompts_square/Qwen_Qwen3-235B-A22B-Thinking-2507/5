To solve the problem of finding the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026** in a square grid spiral, we proceed by first identifying where 2026 is located on the spiral and then calculating the values at each of its eight adjacent positions.

### 🔍 Step 1: Determine the Layer and Coordinates of 2026

The spiral is built such that:
- The center (number **1**) is at layer $ m = 0 $.
- Each layer $ m \geq 1 $ contains $ 8m $ numbers.
- The total number of numbers up to and including layer $ m $ is $ (2m + 1)^2 $.
- The first number in layer $ m $ is $ S(m) = (2m - 1)^2 + 1 $.

We find which layer contains 2026:

$$
\text{Find } m \text{ such that } (2m - 1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2m + 1)^2
$$

Try $ m = 23 $:

$$
(2 \cdot 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \\
(2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
$$

So, 2026 is the **first number** in layer $ m = 23 $, since $ S(23) = 2025 + 1 = 2026 $.

In this spiral format, the **starting point of layer $ m $** is always at position:

$$
(x, y) = (m, -(m - 1))
$$

Thus, for $ m = 23 $, the coordinates of **2026** are:

$$
(x, y) = (23, -22)
$$

### 🧮 Step 2: Identify All 8 Neighbors

From the coordinate $ (23, -22) $, we compute the 8 neighboring positions:

| Direction   | Coordinate (x, y) | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| North       | (23, -21)         | Same x, y+1 |
| Northeast   | (24, -21)         | x+1, y+1    |
| East        | (24, -22)         | x+1, same y |
| Southeast   | (24, -23)         | x+1, y-1    |
| South       | (23, -23)         | Same x, y-1 |
| Southwest   | (22, -23)         | x-1, y-1    |
| West        | (22, -22)         | x-1, same y |
| Northwest   | (22, -21)         | x-1, y+1    |

### 📌 Step 3: Compute the Value at Each Neighbor Position

Using the known structure of the spiral and formulas derived from layerings, we calculate the value at each neighbor:

| Neighbor     | Value | Explanation |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| North        | 2027  | Next number along right edge of layer 23 |
| Northeast    | 2212  | Right edge of layer 24, offset = 2 |
| East         | 2211  | Right edge of layer 24, offset = 1 |
| Southeast    | 2210  | Start of layer 24 |
| South        | 2209  | End of layer 23 → $ 47^2 = 2209 $ |
| Southwest    | 2208  | One before end of layer 23 |
| West         | 2025  | End of layer 22 → $ 45^2 = 2025 $ |
| Northwest    | 1850  | Start of layer 22 → $ 43^2 + 1 = 1850 $ |

### ✅ Step 4: Sum the Values

Now sum all 8 neighbor values:

$$
2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2209 + 2208 + 2025 + 1850
$$

Group and simplify:

- Southeast to Northeast: 2208 to 2212 = 5 numbers → sum = $ 5 \times 2210 = 11050 $
- North and West: $ 2027 + 2025 = 4052 $
- Northwest: 1850

$$
\text{Total} = 11050 + 4052 + 1850 = \boxed{16952}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{16952}
