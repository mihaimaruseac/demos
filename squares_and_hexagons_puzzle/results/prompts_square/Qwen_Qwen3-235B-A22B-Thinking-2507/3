To determine the **sum of all 8 neighbors** of the number **2026** in the **spiral grid**, we first need to understand how the spiral is constructed and how to locate a given number within it.

### 🧭 **Understanding the Spiral Structure**

The spiral begins at the center with the number **1** at position `(0, 0)` on a square grid. The direction of the spiral is **counterclockwise**, moving in layers outward from the center. Each layer `m` (starting from 1) contains **8m** numbers, starting from:

$$
(2m - 1)^2 + 1 \quad \text{to} \quad (2m + 1)^2
$$

This means that **2026** is the **first number** of **layer 23**, since:

$$
(2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \Rightarrow 2026 = (2 \cdot 23 - 1)^2 + 1
$$

So, **2026** is the **start of layer 23**.

### 📍 **Position of 2026**

The **starting point** of any layer `m` is located at coordinates:

$$
(x, y) = (m, -(m - 1))
$$

For **m = 23**, this gives:

$$
(x, y) = (23, -22)
$$

### 🔢 **Neighbors of 2026**

Each number has **8 neighbors** on a square grid: the four adjacent (up, down, left, right), and the four diagonals. The 8 neighbors of **(23, -22)** are:

| Direction      | Coordinates     | Layer Check |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Right          | (24, -22)        | Layer 24    |
| Up             | (23, -21)        | Layer 23    |
| Left           | (22, -22)        | Layer 22    |
| Down           | (23, -23)        | Layer 23    |
| Up-Right       | (24, -21)        | Layer 24    |
| Up-Left        | (22, -21)        | Layer 22    |
| Down-Left      | (22, -23)        | Layer 23    |
| Down-Right     | (24, -23)        | Layer 24    |

We use a precise method to compute the number at each coordinate based on which side of the layer the cell lies on.

### ✅ **Neighboring Numbers**

Using the formula for each side of the layer, we find the corresponding number for each neighbor:

| Neighbor         | Coordinates | Number |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Right            | (24, -22)    | 2211   |
| Up               | (23, -21)    | 2027   |
| Left             | (22, -22)    | 2025   |
| Down             | (23, -23)    | 2209   |
| Up-Right         | (24, -21)    | 2212   |
| Up-Left          | (22, -21)    | 1850   |
| Down-Left        | (22, -23)    | 2208   |
| Down-Right       | (24, -23)    | 2210   |

---

### 📊 **Summing the Neighbors**

Now, summing these eight values:

$$
\begin{align*}
&2211 + 2027 + 2025 + 2209 + 2212 + 1850 + 2208 + 2210 \\
= &16952
\end{align*}
$$

All intermediate steps have been verified through multiple grouping strategies and cross-checked against known patterns in the spiral structure.

### ✅ **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{16952}
