To solve the problem, we begin by understanding the layout of the spiral grid and how numbers are placed. The natural numbers are arranged in a clockwise spiral starting from 1 at the center. A key insight is that the **Chebyshev distance** from the center determines the ring number $ r $, where:

- For ring $ r \geq 1 $, the numbers lie between $ (2r - 1)^2 + 1 $ and $ (2r + 1)^2 $.
- The total number of elements in ring $ r $ is $ 8r $.
- The **start** of ring $ r $ occurs at position $ (r, -(r - 1)) $, corresponding to the number $ N = (2r - 1)^2 + 1 $.

### Step 1: Locate the Number 2026

We find $ r $ such that:
$$
(2r - 1)^2 < 2026 \leq (2r + 1)^2
$$

Since $ 45^2 = 2025 $, it follows that:
$$
(2r - 1)^2 = 45^2 \Rightarrow 2r - 1 = 45 \Rightarrow r = 23
$$

Thus, 2026 is the **first number** of ring $ r = 23 $, located at:
$$
(x, y) = (23, -22)
$$

This is consistent with the formula for the start of ring $ r $: $ (r, -(r - 1)) $.

### Step 2: Identify All 8 Neighbors of (23, -22)

The eight neighbors of a point $(x, y)$ on the grid are all combinations of $(x \pm 1, y \pm 1)$ except the point itself. So the neighbors of $ (23, -22) $ are:

- $ (24, -21) $
- $ (24, -22) $
- $ (24, -23) $
- $ (23, -21) $
- $ (23, -23) $
- $ (22, -21) $
- $ (22, -22) $
- $ (22, -23) $

Each of these coordinates corresponds to a unique number in the spiral. To compute their values, we use the following method:

For a coordinate $(x, y)$, the ring number is:
$$
r = \max(|x|, |y|)
$$

Depending on which edge of the ring the point lies (right, top, left, or bottom), we can compute the value using known formulas. After computing each neighbor's value (as detailed in the thought process), we get:

| Coordinate     | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| (24, -21)      | 2212  |
| (24, -22)      | 2211  |
| (24, -23)      | 2210  |
| (23, -21)      | 2027  |
| (23, -23)      | 2209  |
| (22, -21)      | 1850  |
| (22, -22)      | 2025  |
| (22, -23)      | 2208  |

---

### Step 3: Sum the Neighbor Values

Adding up the values:
$$
2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2027 + 2209 + 1850 + 2025 + 2208 = 16952
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{16952}
$$
