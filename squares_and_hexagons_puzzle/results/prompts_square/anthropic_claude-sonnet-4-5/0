I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the number spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is to the right at (1, 0)
- 3 is up at (1, 1)
- 4 is left at (0, 1)
- 5 is left at (-1, 1)
- 6 is down at (-1, 0)
- 7 is down at (-1, -1)
- 8 is right at (0, -1)
- 9 is right at (1, -1)

The spiral moves: right, up, left-left, down-down, right-right-right, up-up-up, etc.

Let me find the pattern for which "ring" a number is in. The spiral forms square rings:
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)

Ring n (for n ≥ 1) contains 8n numbers and ends at (2n+1)².

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring n ends at (2n+1)²
- (2n+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2n+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- 2n+1 ≥ 46 (must be odd)
- n ≥ 22.5, so n = 23

Ring 22 ends at 45² = 2025
Ring 23 ends at 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in ring 23, and it's the first number after 2025.

Now I need to trace where 2026 is located. The spiral completes ring 22 at position (22, -22) with number 2025.

From the pattern, after completing a ring at the bottom-right corner, the spiral moves right to start the next ring.

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

Let me verify the spiral direction at the start of ring 23:
- 2025 is at (22, -22)
- 2026 is at (23, -22) - moving right
- Then the spiral goes up along the right edge

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -22): this is 2025
- (24, -22): this is 2027
- (22, -21): need to find
- (23, -21): need to find  
- (24, -21): need to find
- (22, -23): need to find
- (23, -23): need to find
- (24, -23): need to find

After 2025 at (22, -22), the sequence continues:
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- 2027 at (24, -22)
- Then moving up: 2028 at (24, -21)

For the numbers below and to the left, I need to trace backward from 2025.

Ring 22 ends at (22, -22) with 2025. Before that:
- Moving along the bottom from left to right
- The bottom-left corner of ring 22 is at (-22, -22)
- From (-22, -22) to (22, -22) is 44 steps

Working backward from 2025:
- 2024 at (21, -22)
- 2023 at (20, -22)
...

The position (22, -23) is in ring 23, after going up from (24, -22) and around.
The position (23, -23) is also in ring 23.
The position (24, -23) is also in ring 23.

Let me reconsider: positions (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23) would need numbers from going down on the left side of ring 23 or around the bottom.

Actually, (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21) are in ring 23, coming from the upward path.
And (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23) are in ring 23, on the bottom edge.

The bottom edge of ring 23 goes from (-23, -23) to (23, -23).
- At (-23, -23) after going down the left edge
- At (23, -23) we have 47² - 23 = 2209 - 23 = 2186

So: (23, -23) has 2186, (22, -23) has 2185, (24, -23) has 2187.

For the upper neighbors:
- 2027 at (24, -22)
- 2028 at (24, -21)
- 2029 at (23, -21)
- 2030 at (22, -21)

The 8 neighbors sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2030 + 2029 + 2028 + 2185 + 2186 + 2187
= 8 × 2026 + (-1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 - 159 - 160 - 161)
= 16208 - 471 = 16208 - 471 = **16216**

Wait, let me recalculate: 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2185 + 2186 + 2187 = **16697**
