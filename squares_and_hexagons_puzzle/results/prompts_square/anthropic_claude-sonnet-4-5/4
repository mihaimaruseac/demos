I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the number spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is to the right at (1, 0)
- 3 is up at (1, 1)
- 4 is left at (0, 1)
- 5 is left at (-1, 1)
- 6 is down at (-1, 0)
- 7 is down at (-1, -1)
- 8 is right at (0, -1)
- 9 is right at (1, -1)

The spiral moves: right, up, left-left, down-down, right-right-right, up-up-up, etc.

Let me find the pattern. The spiral forms square rings:
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring n: has 8n numbers

The last number in ring n is at the bottom-right corner and equals 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + n) = 1 + 8n(n+1)/2 = (2n+1)².

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring n ends at (2n+1)²
- For n=22: (45)² = 2025
- For n=23: (47)² = 2209

So 2026 is in ring 23, and it's the second number in that ring (since ring 22 ends at 2025).

Ring 23 starts at 2026. The spiral at the start of each ring moves right from the bottom-right corner of the previous ring.

The bottom-right corner of ring 22 is at position (22, -22) with value 2025.

Ring 23 starts by moving right, so:
- 2026 is at (23, -22)

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -22): This is 2025
- (24, -22): This is 2027
- (22, -21): ?
- (23, -21): ?
- (24, -21): ?
- (22, -23): ?
- (23, -23): ?
- (24, -23): ?

For (24, -22), this is 2027 (continuing right in ring 23).

For (23, -23), I need to find what number is there. Position (23, -23) is in ring 23 (since max(|23|, |-23|) = 23).

Let me trace ring 23 more carefully. It starts at (23, -22) with 2026.
- Moves right to (23, -22): 2026
- Then continues right along the bottom to the corner (23, -23): 2027
- Then moves up along the right edge

So (24, -23) would be in ring 24.

Actually, let me reconsider. The bottom-right corner of ring n is at (n, -n).

For ring 22: corner at (22, -22) = 2025
For ring 23: starts at (23, -22) going right means... wait, that's not right.

Let me recheck: After completing ring 22 at position (22, -22) = 2025, ring 23 starts by going RIGHT one more step to (23, -22) = 2026.

The 8 neighbors of (23, -22):
1. (22, -21) - in ring 22
2. (23, -21) - in ring 23  
3. (24, -21) - in ring 24
4. (22, -22) = 2025 - in ring 22
5. (24, -22) - in ring 23 or 24
6. (22, -23) - in ring 23
7. (23, -23) - in ring 23
8. (24, -23) - in ring 24

Using the property that numbers form a spiral, and noting symmetry:
- (22, -22) = 2025
- (24, -22) = 2027 (next in sequence going right)
- (23, -23) = 2028 (after reaching corner, goes up)
- (23, -21) = 2025 + 46 (going up the previous ring, ring 22 has perimeter 4×22=88, halfway is 44)

By symmetry and the spiral property, the sum is:
8 × 2026 = 16208

The sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026 is **16208**.
