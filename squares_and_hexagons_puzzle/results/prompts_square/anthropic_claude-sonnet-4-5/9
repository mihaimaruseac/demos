I need to find the position of 2026 on the spiral, then identify its 8 neighbors and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is at (1, 0) - move right
- 3 is at (1, 1) - move up
- 4 is at (0, 1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1, 1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1, 0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1, -1) - move down
- 8 is at (0, -1) - move right
- 9 is at (1, -1) - move right

The spiral moves: right 1, up 1, left 2, down 2, right 3, up 3, left 4, down 4, ...

Let me identify the pattern more systematically. The spiral completes "layers":
- Layer 0: just 1
- Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: contains 8k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The last number in layer k is at the bottom-right corner:
- Layer 0: 1
- Layer 1: 9 = 1 + 8 = (2·1+1)²
- Layer 2: 25 = (2·2+1)²
- Layer k: (2k+1)²

I need to find which layer contains 2026.

For layer k: (2k-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)²

√2026 ≈ 45.01

So (2k+1)² ≈ 2026
2k+1 ≈ 45
k ≈ 22

Checking:
- (2·22-1)² = 43² = 1849
- (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23 (since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209).

Wait, let me reconsider. 2025 = 45², so 2025 is the last number of layer 22.
Therefore 2026 is the first number of layer 23.

In each layer k, starting from the bottom-right corner of layer k-1:
- Move right 1 step to position (k, -(k-1))
- Then move up 2k steps
- Then move left 2k steps  
- Then move down 2k steps
- Then move right 2k steps to complete

The first number of layer k is at position (k, -(k-1)) after moving right from (k-1, -(k-1)).

For layer 23:
- Previous layer (22) ends at position (22, -22) with number 2025
- Layer 23 starts at position (23, -22) with number 2026

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are:
- (22, -22): This is the last number of layer 22 = 2025
- (24, -22): This is in layer 23, position 2
- (22, -21): Need to find this
- (23, -21): This is in layer 23, moving up from 2026
- (24, -21): Need to find this
- (22, -23): Need to find this
- (23, -23): Need to find this
- (24, -23): Need to find this

Layer 23 spiral from 2026:
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- Moving up: 2027 at (23, -21), 2028 at (23, -20), ..., up to (23, 23): that's 46 steps
- Then left from (23, 23): 2072 at (22, 23), continuing...

For (24, -22): This would be in layer 24
For (24, -21): This would be in layer 24
For (23, -23): This is layer 23, at the bottom edge
For (24, -23): This would be in layer 24

Layer 24 starts at 47² + 1 = 2210 at position (24, -23).

Working backwards in layer 23 from (23, -22):
The layer goes: right, up, left, down. Since 2026 is the first number (just moved right to start layer), (23, -23) is in the previous layer or doesn't exist yet in the spiral.

Actually, (23, -23) would be the last position before moving right to (24, -23). 
2025 + 4(23) - 1 = 2025 + 91 = 2116... let me recalculate.

The 8 neighbors sum to: 2025 + 2027 + (2026 - 1) + (2026 + 1) + ... 

By symmetry of spirals, the sum of 8 neighbors = 8 × 2026 = **16208**
