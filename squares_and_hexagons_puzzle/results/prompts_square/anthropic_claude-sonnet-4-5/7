I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral, then identify its 8 neighbors and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0,0)
- 2 is at (1,0) - move right
- 3 is at (1,1) - move up
- 4 is at (0,1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1,1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1,0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1,-1) - move down
- 8 is at (0,-1) - move right
- 9 is at (1,-1) - move right

The spiral moves in layers. Let me identify the pattern:
- Layer 0: just 1
- Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: 8k numbers

The last number in layer k is at the bottom-right corner and equals 1 + 8(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 8k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)².

So layer k ends with (2k+1)².

Let me find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer 22: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Layer 23: (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23, and it's the first number after 2025.

Now I need to trace the spiral pattern. After completing layer 22 (ending at 2025), the spiral continues:
- 2025 is at position (22, -22) (bottom-right of layer 22)
- 2026 is at position (23, -22) (move right to start layer 23)

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern more carefully by checking small cases.

Layer 1 ends at 9, which is at position (1,-1) (bottom-right).
Layer 2 starts at 10, moves right to (2,-1).

The pattern for each layer starting from the bottom-right corner of the previous layer:
1. Move right (1 step to start)
2. Move up (2k+1 steps on the right side)
3. Move left (2k+2 steps on the top)
4. Move down (2k+2 steps on the left)
5. Move right (2k+2 steps on the bottom)

For layer 23:
- Layer 22 ends at 2025 at position (22, -22)
- Position 2026: (23, -22) - first position of layer 23, moved right

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are:
- (22, -22): 2025
- (22, -21): this is in layer 22
- (23, -21): this will be later in layer 23
- (24, -21): this is in layer 24 or doesn't exist yet
- (24, -22): this is in layer 24 or doesn't exist yet
- (24, -23): this is in layer 24 or doesn't exist yet
- (23, -23): this will be later in layer 23
- (22, -23): this is in layer 22

Let me trace more carefully. In layer 22:
- Starts at position (22, -21) with value 2026 - 8×22 = 2026 - 176... 

Actually, let me recalculate. Layer 22 contains values from (2×21+1)² + 1 = 1765 + 1 = 1766 to 2025.

After 2025 at (22, -22), we move right to (23, -22) for 2026.
Then up along the right edge of layer 23.

So 2027 is at (23, -21).

For the bottom edge of layer 22, starting from (22, -22) and going left:
- Going backwards from 2025: 2024, 2023, 2022, ...

The bottom row of layer 22 has 2×22 = 44 numbers.
At (22, -23): 2025 + 1 (wrapping around) = going back... this is 2025 - 44 + 1 = 1982
At (23, -23): This is on layer 23, coming later after going around.

After more careful analysis, the 8 neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030 (from layer 23 going around)
and 1980, 1981, 1982 (from layer 22)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 1980 + 1981 + 1982
    = 8×2026 + (-1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 - 46 - 45 - 44)
    = 16208 + (-126)
    = **16082**
