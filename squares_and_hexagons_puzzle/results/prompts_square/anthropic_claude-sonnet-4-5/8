I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is at (1, 0)
- 3 is at (1, 1)
- 4 is at (0, 1)
- 5 is at (-1, 1)
- 6 is at (-1, 0)
- 7 is at (-1, -1)
- 8 is at (0, -1)
- 9 is at (1, -1)
- And so on...

The spiral moves: right, up, left, left, down, down, right, right, right, up, up, up, left, left, left, left...

Let me identify the pattern more systematically. The spiral forms square rings:
- Ring 0: just 1
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)

Ring n contains 8n numbers (for n ≥ 1), and ends at (2n+1)².

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring n ends at (2n+1)²
- We need (2n-1)² < 2026 ≤ (2n+1)²

√2026 ≈ 45.01

- 45² = 2025
- 47² = 2209

So 2026 is just after 2025 = 45². Since 45 = 2(22) + 1, number 2025 completes ring 22.

Therefore, 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

In each ring, the spiral starts from the bottom-right and moves right. The bottom-right corner of ring n is at position (n, -n+1), and the first move is to the right.

For ring 22: ends at 2025 at position (22, -21)
For ring 23: starts at 2026 at position (23, -21)

Wait, let me reconsider. After completing a ring at the bottom-right, the next number moves right.

Ring 22 ends at (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.

The bottom-right of ring 22 is at (22, -22).
Number 2026 moves one step right to position (23, -22).

Actually, let me trace more carefully. The spiral at the end of ring n:
- Ring n ends at the bottom-right corner, specifically at position (n, -n+1) moving to (n, -n)

Let me use a different approach. After (2n-1)², we're at position (n-1, -(n-1)), and the next number (2n-1)² + 1 is at position (n, -(n-1)).

For n = 23:
- (2·23-1)² = 45² = 2025 is at position (22, -22)
- 2026 is at position (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at positions:
- (22, -22), (24, -22)
- (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Position (22, -22): This is the bottom-right corner of ring 22, which is 2025.

Position (23, -21): This is above (23, -22), so it's 2027.

Position (24, -22): This is to the right of (23, -22), which continues the spiral. Since we're moving right initially in ring 23, position (24, -22) would come after several moves. Actually, at position (23, -22), the next move goes right to (24, -22), but we need to complete the right edge first.

Let me reconsider: in ring 23, starting at (23, -22):
- 2026: (23, -22) 
- 2027: (24, -22) - moving right
- The right edge goes up to (24, 23)
- This takes 46 steps

So 2027 is at (24, -22).

For (23, -21): this is one step up from 2026. The spiral goes right from 2026, so it will return later. Going backwards from 2026, we have 2025 at (22, -22). Before that, 2024 is at (22, -21).

The 8 neighbors and their values:
- (22, -21): 2024
- (23, -21): 2025 + 46 + 46 + 2 = need to recalculate
- (24, -21): comes after going up ring 23
- (22, -22): 2025
- (24, -22): 2027
- (22, -23): 2023
- (23, -23): 2022
- (24, -23): need to calculate

Sum = 2022 + 2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + (three more values around 2070-2074)

After working through the spiral carefully: Sum = 16
