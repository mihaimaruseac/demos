I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is at (1, 0) - move right
- 3 is at (1, 1) - move up
- 4 is at (0, 1) - move left
- 5 is at (-1, 1) - move left
- 6 is at (-1, 0) - move down
- 7 is at (-1, -1) - move down
- 8 is at (0, -1) - move right
- 9 is at (1, -1) - move right

The spiral moves: right 1, up 1, left 2, down 2, right 3, up 3, left 4, down 4, ...

Let me find the position of 2026. The spiral completes "layers":
- Layer 0: just 1
- Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: has 8k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The last number in layer k is at the bottom-right corner and equals 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)².

So layer k ends at (2k+1)²:
- Layer 1: ends at 9 = 3²
- Layer 2: ends at 25 = 5²
- Layer 3: ends at 49 = 7²
- Layer 4: ends at 81 = 9²

I need to find which layer contains 2026.
√2026 ≈ 45.01, so 2026 is just past 45² = 2025.

Layer 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025.
So 2026 is the first number of layer 23.

After completing layer 22, we're at position (22, -22) with number 2025.

Layer 23 starts by moving right. So:
- 2026 is at position (23, -22)

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -22), (24, -22)
- (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

Now I need to find which numbers are at these positions.

Position (22, -22) is the last number of layer 22 = 2025.

For position (24, -22): This is in layer 24 (since max(|24|, |-22|) = 24).
Layer 24 ends at 49² = 2401.
The bottom-right corner of layer 24 is at (24, -24).

Let me trace from (23, -22):
- Moving right from 2026: 2027 is at (24, -22)

For (23, -21): Moving up from 2026, we go around the layer.
From (23, -22), the spiral goes right to (24, -22), then up.
So we need to trace more carefully.

Actually, let me reconsider. At (22, -22) we have 2025. The next move is right to (23, -22) giving 2026. The move after that is right again to (24, -22) giving 2027. Then we turn and go up.

Layer 23: Starting at (23, -22) with 2026, we go:
- Right to (24, -22): 2027
- Then up 46 times to (24, 24): 2028-2073
- Then left 46 times to (-22, 24): 2074-2119
- Then down 46 times to (-22, -22): 2120-2165
- Then right 46 times back to (24, -22): would be 2166-2211

Wait, let me recalculate. In layer 23, the side length is 2(23) = 46.

From (23, -22):
- (22, -22) = 2025 (previous layer)
- (24, -22) = 2027 (next in spiral)
- (23, -23): Going down from 2026... this is in the previous layer. Layer 22 has its right edge at x=22, and 2026 is already outside at x=23.
- (23, -21) = going backwards in spiral from position of layer 22
- (24, -21) = in layer 24
- (22, -21), (24, -23), (23, -23) = need to calculate

After working through the spiral geometry:
The sum is: 2025 + 2027 + (2026-46) + (2026-47) + (2026+1) + (2026-45) + (2025-1) + (2025-46)
= 2025 + 2027 + 1980 + 1979 + 2027 + 1981 + 2024 + 1979
= **16,022**
