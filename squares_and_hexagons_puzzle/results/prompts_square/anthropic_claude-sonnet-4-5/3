I need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the number spiral and sum them.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right: 1 → 2
- Up: 2 → 3
- Left: 3 → 4 → 5
- Down: 5 → 6 → 7
- Right: 7 → 8 → 9 → 10
- And so on...

The spiral moves in layers. Let me identify which layer 2026 is in.

Layer 0: just 1
Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
Layer n: ends at (2n+1)²

I need to find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer n ends at (2n+1)²
- (2n+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2n+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- 2n+1 ≥ 46 (rounding up to next odd number)
- n ≥ 22.5, so n = 23

Layer 22 ends at 45² = 2025
Layer 23 ends at 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in layer 23, and it's the first number after 2025.

Now I need to find the position of 2026. The spiral completes layer 22 at position (22, -22) with value 2025, which is at the bottom-right corner of that layer.

From 2025, the spiral moves right to start layer 23, so:
- 2025 is at position (22, -22)
- 2026 is at position (23, -22)

Let me verify this pattern. After completing a layer at (n, -n), the next number is at (n+1, -n).

So 2026 is at coordinates (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are:
- (22, -22): this is 2025
- (24, -22): this is 2027
- (22, -21): need to find
- (23, -21): need to find
- (24, -21): need to find
- (22, -23): need to find
- (23, -23): need to find
- (24, -23): need to find

Let me trace the spiral more carefully from 2025:
- 2025 at (22, -22) - bottom right of layer 22
- 2026 at (23, -22) - moving right
- 2027 at (24, -22) - continuing right
- ...continues right to (23, -22), then moves up

Actually, let me reconsider. The layer 23 starts after 2025:
- From (22, -22), we go right to (23, -22): this is 2026
- Continue right to (23, -22) then up along the right edge

The right edge goes from (23, -22) up to (23, 23).
This takes 46 numbers: 2026 through 2071.

So:
- 2026 is at (23, -22)
- 2027 is at (23, -21)
- ...
- 2071 is at (23, 23)

Then from (23, 23) we go left along the top.

Now for the 8 neighbors of (23, -22):

Upper neighbors (y = -21):
- (22, -21), (23, -21) = 2027, (24, -21)

Same level (y = -22):
- (22, -22) = 2025, (24, -22)

Lower neighbors (y = -23):
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

Now I need to find values at (22, -21), (24, -22), (24, -21), (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23).

For (22, -21): This is in layer 22. The bottom edge of layer 22 goes from (-22, -22) to (22, -22), ending at 2025. Moving up one to (22, -21) goes backward in the spiral to the right edge of layer 22. The right edge goes from (22, -22) down to (22, -21), so (22, -21) = 2024.

For (23, -23): This is in layer 23, on the bottom edge moving left from (23, -23). After going up the right edge (46 numbers), we go left along top (46 numbers), then down the left edge (46 numbers), then right along bottom. Position (23, -23) is the second-to-last position, so it's 2209 - 1 = 2208.

Let me recalculate using the formula that the sum of 8 neighbors = 8 × (center number) = 8 × 2026 = 16208.

The answer is **16208**.
