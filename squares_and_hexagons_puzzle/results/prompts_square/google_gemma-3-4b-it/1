Let the spiral be laid out on a square grid. The numbers are written in the spiral as follows:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
The numbers are arranged in a spiral. We are given the number 2026 in the spiral. We want to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.

The numbers on the spiral can be arranged in a spiral starting from the center.
Let the grid be a square grid with dimensions $n \times n$.
We are given the numbers written in a spiral on a square grid. The numbers are arranged in the following order:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We are looking for the neighbors of the number 2026.

We can assume the grid is $n \times n$.
The spiral starts at the center, and the numbers are filled in order.
Let's consider the case where the spiral starts at the center point $(n/2, n/2)$ in the $n \times n$ grid. The spiral goes outwards.
The coordinates of the numbers are $(i, j)$, where $i, j \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
The number 2026 is located at some point $(i, j)$ in the spiral.
We need to find the 8 neighbors of the number 2026. The neighbors are the numbers adjacent to 2026.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers in the eight cells surrounding it.
However, we are not given the size of the grid, so we cannot determine the exact location of 2026.

Let's consider the spiral arrangement. The numbers are arranged in the order 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 8, 7, ..., 1.
The spiral is formed by starting at the center and moving outwards.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral.
Since the numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid, we are dealing with a matrix.
We are looking for the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
Let the number 2026 be at position $(x, y)$ in the grid.
The neighbors are the elements in the 3x3 grid around $(x, y)$.
The neighbors are $(x-1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x-1, y+1), (x, y-1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x+1, y), (x+1, y+1)$.
The sum of the 8 neighbors is:
$(x-1) + y-1 + (x-1) + y + (x-1) + y+1 + x + y-1 + x + y+1 + x+1 + y-1 + x+1 + y+1$
$= 8x + 8y - 4$
However, this is not correct.

The problem states that the natural numbers are written on a spiral laid out on a square grid. We have the pattern
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We can assume that the numbers are arranged in a spiral. Since 2026 is in the spiral, let's analyze the neighboring numbers.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it.
Looking at the given arrangement, the numbers are written in a spiral.
The neighbors of 2026 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The neighboring numbers could be arranged in a spiral.

Let the number 2026 be in the $i$-th position in the spiral.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it in the spiral.
Let's consider the case where the grid is $3 \times 3$. The numbers in the grid are:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
We want to find the neighbors of 5.
The neighbors are 4, 6, 7, 8. The sum of the neighbors is $4+6+7+8 = 25$.

Since we are looking for the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026, we are looking for the sum of the numbers in the 3x3 grid around the number 2026.
Let the center of the spiral be the origin (0,0). The spiral goes outwards.
Since we are given that the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we can consider the numbers to be arranged in a square grid.
The number 2026 is in the grid. The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is $S$.

Final Answer: The final answer is 81.
