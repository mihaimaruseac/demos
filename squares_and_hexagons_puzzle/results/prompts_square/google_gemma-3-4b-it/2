Let the square grid be arranged such that the numbers are laid out in a spiral. The given arrangement is
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We want to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we can find the location of the number 2026.
The numbers on the grid are laid out in a spiral such that the numbers increase as we move outwards from the center. The numbers are arranged in the following order:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ...
The arrangement of the spiral is as follows:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
...
The spiral starts from the center and goes outwards in a spiral. The numbers are written in a clockwise manner.
We want to find the location of 2026 in the spiral.
We can think of the square grid as a $n \times n$ grid.
The spiral starts at the center and increases in value.
The numbers are arranged in increasing order.
We are given that the spiral is laid out on a square grid.
The numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., $n^2$.
Let the number 2026 be at position $(x, y)$ in the grid. Then $x, y$ are integers such that $1 \le x, y \le n$.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral, we have $x+y = \frac{n^2+1}{2}$.
We have $2026 = n^2$. This is not possible since 2026 is not a perfect square.
However, the spiral arrangement is such that the numbers are laid out as
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We can think of the numbers as arranged in a square.
The numbers are arranged in order as
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
We are looking for the sum of the neighbors of 2026.
The number 2026 is written on the spiral, so we can find its neighbors.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it in the spiral.
Since the spiral arrangement is laid out on a square grid, we can assume the grid is $n \times n$.
We can think of the spiral as starting at the center of the square and spiraling outwards.
The number 2026 is placed in the grid.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers that are adjacent to it.
Since the spiral is laid out on a square grid, the neighbors of 2026 are the numbers in the adjacent cells.
We need to find the neighbors of 2026. Since the arrangement is spiral, we can consider the 8 neighbors around the number 2026.
Let's assume the spiral is a large square grid. The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to it.
Let's denote the value at the center of the square as $c$.
The spiral starts with $c$.
The neighbors of $c$ are $c+1, c+2, \dots$.
However, the spiral is laid out in a square grid.
The neighbors of 2026 are the numbers adjacent to 2026.

The numbers in the spiral are arranged as
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
The number 2026 is not present in this arrangement.

Since we are given the arrangement of the numbers in a spiral, we can approximate the number of terms in the spiral. The numbers are arranged in increasing order.
Since $2026 = n^2$, we have $n = \sqrt{2026} \approx 45$.
The number of terms in the spiral is $2n-1 = 2(45)-1 = 89$.

The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is the sum of the 8 numbers around 2026.
Let's consider the 8 neighbors of 2026.
The neighbors will be 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031.
The sum is $2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 = 8(2026) - 2026 = 16208 - 2026 = 14182$.
However, we are given the numbers 5, 4, 3, ...
We have $2026 - 5 = 2021$ and $2026 + 5 = 2031$.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031.
The sum is $2023 + 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 = 14182$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{14182}$
