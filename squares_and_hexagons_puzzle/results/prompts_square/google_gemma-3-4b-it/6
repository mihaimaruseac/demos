Let the grid be a square grid. The numbers are laid out on the spiral in the following manner:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
... 10 11 12 ...
... 13 14 15 ...
... 16 17 18 ...
... 19 20 21 ...
... 22 23 24 ...
... 25 26 27 ...

We are given the number 2026. We need to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of 2026.
Since the numbers are arranged in a spiral on a square grid, we can consider the coordinates of the number 2026. We can assume the grid starts at (1,1) and the spiral increases as we go around the square. The number 2026 is located in the 2026th position on the spiral.

The number 2026 is in the row 26 and column 26.
Let the grid be $n \times n$.
We are looking for the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.
The neighbors of a number in a grid are the numbers that are adjacent to it. In this case, the numbers are arranged in a spiral, so the neighbors are the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in the grid.
Since the grid is square, each number has a maximum of 8 neighbors.

We can consider the grid as a 2D array. The coordinates of 2026 are $(26, 26)$.
The neighbors are the cells $(25, 26), (27, 26), (26, 25), (26, 27), (24, 26), (28, 26), (26, 24), (26, 28)$.
However, since we are on a spiral, the grid is not square.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral.
We have the number 2026 at (26, 26).
The neighbors are:
(25, 26), (27, 26), (26, 25), (26, 27), (24, 26), (28, 26), (26, 24), (26, 28).
The numbers in the grid are numbered in the order of the spiral.
Let's denote the numbers as $a_{i,j}$, where $i$ is the row number and $j$ is the column number.
The number 2026 is at $a_{26, 26}$.
The neighbors are:
$a_{25, 26}, a_{27, 26}, a_{26, 25}, a_{26, 27}, a_{24, 26}, a_{28, 26}, a_{26, 24}, a_{26, 28}$.
We need to find the sum of these 8 numbers.

The spiral is laid out as follows:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
...
We are looking for the number 2026.
The grid is of size $n \times n$. Since the spiral increases, we can determine the dimensions of the grid.

Let the number of cells in the spiral be $N$.
The number of cells in the spiral is approximately $N = \frac{n^2}{2}$.
The location of 2026 can be determined.

The total sum of the numbers from 1 to $n^2$ is $\frac{n^2(n^2+1)}{2}$.
The sum of the neighbors of 2026 is the sum of the 8 neighbors.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{9136}$
