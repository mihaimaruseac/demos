Let the square grid be labeled as follows:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
The numbers are arranged in a spiral on the grid. We want to find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
First, we need to determine the location of 2026 in the spiral. The spiral starts with the number 1 in the center.
The numbers are arranged in increasing order as we move outward.

The numbers are arranged as follows:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
...

However, we are given the spiral:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
This is a partial spiral.
The numbers are arranged in increasing order. We can assume that the numbers are arranged as follows:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
We want to find the location of 2026 in this spiral. Since the numbers are increasing, we can see that 2026 must be somewhere in the spiral.
Let's examine the spiral arrangement.
1 is at the center.
2 is to the right of 1.
3 is to the right of 2.
...
We can visualize the spiral as follows:
```
        1
      2 3
    4 5 6
  7 8 9 10
 ...
```
However, this is not the spiral we are given. The given spiral is:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
We can see that the numbers are arranged in the following order:
```
... 5 4 3 6 1 2 7 8 9 ...
```
The number 2026 must be placed in the spiral such that it is greater than 9 and less than the next number.
We want to find the location of 2026 in the spiral.
The spiral looks like this:
```
  7 8 9 10
  6 1 2 3
  5 4 3 2
```
We can see that 2026 is placed in the 4th row.
Since the spiral is laid out on a square grid, the neighbors of 2026 are the 8 numbers immediately surrounding it.
In this case, 2026 is at position (3,2) in the spiral.
The coordinates are (row, column), starting from (1,1).
So, the coordinates of 2026 are (3, 2).
The neighbors are:
- Top: 2026
- Bottom: 2026
- Left: 2026
- Right: 2026
- Top-Left: 7
- Top-Right: 8
- Bottom-Left: 6
- Bottom-Right: 9
The sum of the neighbors is $7+8+6+9+2026+2026+2026+2026 = 7+8+6+9 + 4(2026) = (7+8+6+9) + 4(2026) = 30 + 8104 = 8134$.

The number 2026 is in the third row and second column of the spiral.
The neighbors are the 8 numbers around 2026.
We can label the grid with coordinates (row, column) starting from (1,1) in the top left corner.
The number 2026 is at (3,2).
The neighbors are:
- (2,1) - 6
- (2,2) - 1
- (2,3) - 2
- (3,1) - 7
- (3,3) - 9
- (4,2) - 8
- (4,1) - 5
- (4,3) - 3
The sum of the neighbors is $6+1+2+7+9+8+5+3 = 41$.

However, we are given the spiral:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
We want the sum of the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is in the 3rd row and 2nd column, the neighboring numbers are:
- 1 (above)
- 2 (above)
- 6 (left)
- 7 (top left)
- 8 (top right)
- 9 (right)
- 1 (right)
- 2 (below)
The sum is $1+2+6+7+8+9+1+2 = 36$.

The given spiral is a partial spiral. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...
The spiral can be represented as:
```
5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9
```
2026 is not in this spiral.

Let's assume the spiral continues outward in a similar pattern.
The given spiral is:
5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9
If the spiral continues like this, we need to determine the number in the grid that is near 2026.
Let the spiral be represented as a circle, with 1 in the center. The numbers increase as we move outwards.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral. We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{36}$
