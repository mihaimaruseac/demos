First, let's understand the pattern of the numbering on the grid.

The problem states the natural numbers are written on a square grid in a spiral pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

The given example is:

- '1' is at the center.
- Numbers increase as we go in a spiral outward (seems to be counterclockwise).

Let's first confirm the spiral and coordinate system.

---

### Step 1: Confirm the spiral pattern and coordinates

Let's put coordinates on the grid, with `(x,y)`, where `(0,0)` is the position of `1`.

From the example, the numbers and their coordinates are:

- 1 at (0, 0)
- 2 at (1, 0)
- 3 at (1, -1)
- 4 at (0, -1)
- 5 at (-1, -1)
- 6 at (-1, 0)
- 7 at (-1, 1)
- 8 at (0, 1)
- 9 at (1, 1)

This matches the 3x3 grid:

```
  y=1: 7 8 9
  y=0: 6 1 2
  y=-1:5 4 3
     x=-1 0 1
```

Check this:

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0) (right)
- 3 at (1,-1) (down)
- 4 at (0,-1) (left)
- 5 at (-1,-1) (left)
- 6 at (-1,0) (up)
- 7 at (-1,1) (up)
- 8 at (0,1) (right)
- 9 at (1,1) (right)

Yes, this is a spiral that starts at 1(0,0), moves right (2), then down (3), left(4,5), up(6,7,8), and so on.

So the spiral goes:

- Right 1 step: 2
- Down 1 step: 3
- Left 2 steps: 4,5
- Up 2 steps: 6,7
- Right 3 steps: 8,9,10
- Down 3 steps: 11,12,13
- Left 4 steps: 14,15,16,17
- Up 4 steps: 18,19,20,21
- ...

The length of the side segments increases as 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,...

Directions cycle as: Right → Down → Left → Up → Right → Down → ...

---

### Step 2: Find the coordinate (x,y) for number 2026

This is the key step: given a number n, find its (x, y).

---

### Step 2a: Determine the layer/shell/block of the number

In this spiral, numbers are grouped in layers defined by "rings".

- Layer 0: just number 1 at (0,0)
- Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9
- Layer 2: numbers 10 to ?
- Layer k: numbers in the k-th ring around the center.

Numbering of layers:

- The first ring around center has side length 3 (from -1 to 1 in x or y), containing numbers 2..9
- The second ring has side length 5 (from -2 to 2), containing 10..?
- The k-th ring has side length = 2k + 1
- The max number in the k-th ring is `(2k+1)^2`
- The min number in the k-th ring (except k=0) is `(2(k-1)+1)^2 + 1 = (2k -1)^2 + 1`

For example:
- k=0: side = 1, max number = 1^2 = 1
- k=1: side = 3, max number = 3^2 = 9, numbers from 2 to 9
- k=2: side = 5, max = 5^2=25, numbers 10 to 25
- k=3: side=7, max=49, numbers 26 to 49, etc.

Let's find k such that:

\[
(2(k-1)+1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2
\]

or equivalently:

\[
(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2
\]

Let's find `(2k+1)^2` ≥ 2026.

Try some squares:

- 43^2 = 1849
- 45^2 = 2025
- 47^2 = 2209

So:

- 45^2 = 2025 < 2026
- 47^2 = 2209 ≥ 2026

So `2k+1 = 47` → `k = (47 -1)/2 = 23`

Check lower bound:

\[
(2k-1)^2 = (46-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 < 2026
\]

So 2026 belongs to layer k=23 shell.

---

### Step 2b: The layer 23 ring

The ring goes from number:

\[
(2(k-1)+1)^2 + 1 = (2 \cdot 22 +1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026
\]

up to:

\[
(2k+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209
\]

So layer 23 contains numbers from 2026 to 2209 inclusive.

Our number is **2026**, which is the first number in layer 23.

---

### Step 2c: Coordinates on layer 23

At each layer k, the side length is `2k + 1`. The ring has four sides, each of length `2k`.

Total numbers in ring k:

\[
(2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = 4k(2k+1 - (2k-1)) = 4k\cdot 2 = 8k
\]

So number of elements on layer k is `8k` (which makes sense).

For k=23, the ring contains 8*23 = 184 numbers.

---

### Step 2d: The spiral's traversal around the ring

The spiral starts at the bottom-right corner of the ring:

- The bottom-right corner of layer k is at coordinate (k, -k)
- This corner contains the maximum number in the ring: `(2k+1)^2`

For example:

- layer 1 maximum number 9 at (1, -1)
- layer 2 max 25 at (2,-2)
- layer k max `(2k+1)^2` at (k, -k)

So the numbers on the ring k are "around" the square with corners:

- bottom-right: (k, -k), number = (2k+1)^2
- bottom-left: (-k, -k)
- top-left: (-k, k)
- top-right: (k, k)

We know the spiral is anticlockwise.

We can find the number at bottom-right corner, and then go backward along the ring by decreasing number to get to number 2026.

Since 2026 is the start of the ring (minimum number in ring), and ring max number is 2209 at (23, -23).

So ring numbers run backwards from:

- 2209 at (23, -23) [bottom-right corner]
- followed by moving left to bottom-left corner: numbers decrease by `side length - 1 = 2k = 46` steps
- then up to top-left corner: another 2k steps
- then right to top-right corner: another 2k steps
- then down to bottom-right corner: another 2k steps

These four sides walk through all `8k` numbers.

---

### Step 2e: From max number at bottom-right corner, walk backwards

So if we travel *counterclockwise*, numbers decrease along the four edges in this order:

- from bottom-right corner (max number): move left → bottom edge
- then move up → left edge
- then move right → top edge
- then move down → right edge back to bottom-right corner

The distance from maximum number to 2026 (start number) is:

\[
2209 - 2026 = 183
\]

There are total 184 numbers in the ring, numbering from 2026 (start) to 2209 (max).

The first number 2026 corresponds to position 0 along the ring, max number 2209 corresponds to position 183.

Positions along the ring count from 0 (start of ring) to 183 (end of ring, max).

---

### Step 2f: Parametrize the ring position into coordinates

From the bottom-right corner with number 2209 at pos = 183, we go:

- Left along bottom edge: length = 2k = 46 steps
- Up along left edge: length 46 steps
- Right along top edge: length 46 steps
- Down along right edge: length 46 steps

Positions along the ring from the max = 2209:

- pos 183 to 138 (2209 - 46 = 2163): bottom edge (going left)
- pos 138 to 92 (2163 - 46 = 2117): left edge (going up)
- pos 92 to 46 (2117 - 46 = 2071): top edge (going right)
- pos 46 to 0 (2071 - 46 = 2025): right edge (going down)

Check position value `(2209 - n)` and see where it falls:

\[
d = 2209 - 2026 = 183
\]

Now step through edges from pos=183 backward.

- Bottom edge: positions from 183 down to 138 (183 - 46 + 1 = 138)

Is 183 in [138..183]? Yes → bottom edge

Calculate offset `o` from bottom-right corner towards bottom-left corner along bottom edge:

\[
o = 183 - 138 = 45
\]

Positions count side length 46 (0 to 45)

Coordinates on bottom edge:

- start at (k, -k) = (23, -23)
- each step moves left → decrease x by 1 per step
- y remains -23

So:

\[
x = 23 - o = 23 - 45 = -22
\]
\[
y = -23
\]

---

### Step 2g: Check the number at position `o=45` on bottom edge:

Number at (x,y) = (23 - o, -23) is:

\[
N = 2209 - o = 2209 - 45 = 2164
\]

But this contradicts our previous calculation.

Wait, the math needs correction:

Positions on ring from max number at bottom-right corner are counted as:

- pos = 0 at max number (2209)
- pos increases as we move counter-clockwise.

Previously, we considered pos backwards `d = 2209 - n`.

But better is to define pos directly as:

\[
pos = n - \text{start ring number} = n - 2026
\]

Here, `start ring number = 2026`

So `pos` runs from 0 to 183 inclusive.

We want to find (x,y) given `pos`

In that scheme:

- pos = 0 corresponds to 2026, which is at the start of ring k=23, which is the bottom-right corner shifted by 1? No.

In the spiral, the ring starts at the bottom-right corner number `(2k-1)^2 + 1`?

No, the maximum number is at bottom-right corner.

The minimum number in the ring is at bottom-right corner + 1?

No.

Wait, we should reconsider the ring start position.

---

### Step 2h: Proper ring numbering from reference

From layer definition:

- Max number at bottom-right corner: `(2k+1)^2`
- The ring numbers descend as you move CCW around the square.
- The minimum number in the ring is `(2k-1)^2 + 1`

The bottom-right corner has the max number.

Positions along the ring can be indexed as:

\[
pos = \text{max number} - n
\]

so:

- pos = 0 at bottom-right corner max number = 2209
- pos increases as n decreases

Therefore:

\[
pos = 2209 - n
\]

For n=2026:

\[
pos = 2209 - 2026 = 183
\]

Orientation of pos:

- pos = 0 at bottom-right corner (k, -k)
- pos from 0 to 45 → bottom edge (move left)
- pos 46 to 91 → left edge (move up)
- pos 92 to 137 → top edge (move right)
- pos 138 to 183 → right edge (move down)

Check if 183 falls where:

- pos 138 - 183: right edge (going down)

So 183 is on the right edge side, somewhere.

---

### Step 2i: Calculate offset on the edge

Edges length = 2k = 46 steps.

We identify edges as:

- Bottom edge: pos [0..45]
- Left edge: pos [46..91]
- Top edge: pos [92..137]
- Right edge: pos [138..183]

183 is in right edge, offset on right edge:

\[
offset = pos - 138 = 183 -138 = 45
\]

Positions go from 0 to 45 along edge.

---

### Step 2j: Coordinates on the right edge

Right edge goes from top-right corner (k, k) down to bottom-right corner (k, -k):

- Start at (k, k) = (23, 23)
- Move down by offset: y decreases by offset
- x remains k = 23

So coordinates:

\[
x = 23
\]
\[
y = 23 - offset = 23 - 45 = -22
\]

Therefore, **number 2026 is at (23, -22)**.

---

### Step 3: Find all 8 neighbors of (23, -22)

Neighbors are all points adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally:

\[
(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)
\]

At `(23, -22)` neighbors:

- (22, -23)
- (23, -23)
- (24, -23)
- (22, -22)
- (24, -22)
- (22, -21)
- (23, -21)
- (24, -21)

---

### Step 4: For each neighbor coordinate, find the corresponding number

---

### Step 4a: Number at any coordinate (x, y)

We need a formula to map `(x,y)` to number `n`.

---

### Step 4b: Formula to find number n from (x,y)

From the spiral coordinate system and rings:

- Layer k = max(|x|, |y|)
- The number at bottom-right corner of layer k is:

\[
max_k = (2k + 1)^2
\]

From the above step, the square ring is built as:

- Bottom-right corner: (k, -k) → max_k
- From bottom-right corner, moving:

1. left along bottom edge (length = 2k)
2. up along left edge
3. right along top edge
4. down along right edge

Number decreases as we move CCW.

Given that, the number at coordinate (x,y) in layer k can be calculated as:

---

Let:

\[
k = \max(|x|, |y|)
\]

Calculate max number at layer k:

\[
max_k = (2k + 1)^2
\]

Now find the offset from bottom-right corner (k, -k) to (x,y):

Positions along edges are:

- Bottom edge: from (k, -k) to (-k, -k) if y = -k, x from k down to -k
- Left edge: from (-k, -k) to (-k, k) if x = -k, y from -k up to k
- Top edge: from (-k, k) to (k, k) if y = k, x from -k up to k
- Right edge: from (k, k) to (k, -k) if x = k, y from k down to -k

---

Check which edge (x, y) is on (for k>0):

- if y == -k → bottom edge → position = distance from bottom-right corner moving left:
  
  offset = k - x

- else if x == -k → left edge → position = bottom edge length + distance moving up along left edge:

  offset = (2k) + (y + k)

- else if y == k → top edge → offset = (4k) + (x + k)

- else if x == k → right edge → offset = (6k) + (k - y)

---

The number at position offset along ring k is:

\[
n = max_k - offset
\]

---

### Step 4c: For each neighbor, find k, offset, n

Let's compute the number for each neighbor:

---

**Neighbor 1:** (22, -23)

- \(x=22, y=-23\)
- \(k = \max(|22|, |−23|) = 23\)
- Check which edge:

Since \(y = -k = -23\), bottom edge.

Offset:

\[
offset = k - x = 23 - 22 = 1
\]

Number:

\[
n = max_k - offset = 2209 - 1 = 2208
\]

---

**Neighbor 2:** (23, -23)

- \(x=23, y=-23\)
- \(k=23\)
- \(y = -k\) bottom edge

Offset:

\[
offset = 23 - 23 = 0
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2209 - 0 = 2209
\]

---

**Neighbor 3:** (24, -23)

- \(x=24, y=-23\)
- \(k = \max(|24|, |−23|) = 24\)

Now for layer 24:

\[
max_{24} = (2 \cdot 24 + 1)^2 = 49^2 = 2401
\]

Since \(y = -k = -24\)?

No, \(y=-23 \ne -24\), so not bottom edge for k=24

Check edges:

- y = -24? no
- x = -24? no
- y = 24? no
- x = 24? yes

Since \(x = k = 24\), right edge.

Offset on right edge for k=24:

\[
offset = 6k + (k - y) = 6 \times 24 + (24 - (-23)) = 144 + 47 = 191
\]

Number:

\[
n = max_k - offset = 2401 - 191 = 2210
\]

---

**Neighbor 4:** (22, -22)

- \(k = \max(|22|, |−22|) = 22\)

\[
max_{22} = (2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

Check which edge:

- y = -22 = -k = -22? yes → bottom edge

Offset:

\[
offset = k - x = 22 - 22 = 0
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2025 - 0 = 2025
\]

---

**Neighbor 5:** (24, -22)

- \(k = \max(|24|, |-22|) = 24\)

\[
max_{24} = 2401
\]

Check edges:

- y == -24? No (y=-22)
- x == -24? No (x=24)
- y == 24? No
- x == 24? Yes

Right edge.

Offset:

\[
offset = 6k + (k - y) = 6 \times 24 + (24 - (-22)) = 144 + 46 = 190
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2401 - 190 = 2211
\]

---

**Neighbor 6:** (22, -21)

- \(k = \max(22, 21) = 22\)

\[
max_{22} = 2025
\]

Check edges for k=22:

- y = -22? no
- x = -22? no
- y = 22? no
- x = 22? yes (since x=22 = k)

Right edge offset:

\[
offset = 6k + (k - y) = 6 \times 22 + (22 - (-21)) = 132 + 43 = 175
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2025 - 175 = 1850
\]

---

**Neighbor 7:** (23, -21)

- \(k = \max(23, 21) = 23\)

\[
max_{23} = 2209
\]

Check edges for k=23:

- y = -23? no (y=-21)
- x = -23? no (x=23)
- y = 23? no
- x = 23? yes

Right edge:

\[
offset = 6k + (k - y) = 6 \times 23 + (23 - (-21)) = 138 + 44 = 182
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2209 - 182 = 2027
\]

---

**Neighbor 8:** (24, -21)

- \(k = \max(24, 21) = 24\)

\[
max_{24} = 2401
\]

Check edges for k=24:

- x=24 → right edge

Offset:

\[
offset = 6k + (k - y) = 144 + (24 - (-21)) = 144 + 45 = 189
\]

Number:

\[
n = 2401 - 189 = 2212
\]

---

### Step 5: List of neighbors:

| Neighbor Coord | k  | max_k | Edge    | Offset | Number n |
|----------------|----|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| (22,-23)       | 23 | 2209   | bottom  | 1      | 2208     |
| (23,-23)       | 23 | 2209   | bottom  | 0      | 2209     |
| (24,-23)       | 24 | 2401   | right   | 191    | 2210     |
| (22,-22)       | 22 | 2025   | bottom  | 0      | 2025     |
| (24,-22)       | 24 | 2401   | right   | 190    | 2211     |
| (22,-21)       | 22 | 2025   | right   | 175    | 1850     |
| (23,-21)       | 23 | 2209   | right   | 182    | 2027     |
| (24,-21)       | 24 | 2401   | right   | 189    | 2212     |

---

### Step 6: Calculate sum of neighbors

Sum:

\[
2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212
\]

Calculate stepwise:

- 2208 + 2209 = 4417
- 4417 + 2210 = 6627
- 6627 + 2025 = 8652
- 8652 + 2211 = 10863
- 10863 + 1850 = 12713
- 12713 + 2027 = 14740
- 14740 + 2212 = 16952

**Sum = 16952**

---

### Final answer:

\[
\boxed{16952}
\]

---

# **Summary:**

- Number 2026 is at coordinate (23, -22)
- Neighbors have numbers calculated using layer k and edge offsets
- Sum of 8 neighbors of 2026 is **16952**
