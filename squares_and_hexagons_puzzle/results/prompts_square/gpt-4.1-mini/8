We have a number spiral laid out on a square grid as follows:

\[
\begin{matrix}
5 & 4 & 3 \\
6 & 1 & 2 \\
7 & 8 & 9 \\
\end{matrix}
\]

where the numbers spiral starting at 1 in the center and moving to the right, then up, then left, then down, and so forth in a counter-clockwise spiral.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Layout

The spiral starts with:

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)

and so on.

The pattern is a well-known **Ulam spiral** or a square spiral where the numbers increase as you go outward in rings.

---

### Step 2: Find the coordinates of number 2026 in the spiral

We need to find the x,y coordinates of the number 2026.

---

### Step 2a: Understanding the layer (or "ring") of 2026

The spiral is constructed in "rings" or layers around 1:

- Ring 0: just number 1 at (0,0)
- Ring 1: numbers from 2 to 9 on the square with side length 3 centered at (0,0)
- Ring n has numbers filling a square ring of side \(2n+1\) with:

Largest number in ring \(n\) = \((2n+1)^2\).

Thus:

- Ring 0: largest number = \(1^2 = 1\)
- Ring 1: largest number = \(3^2 = 9\)
- Ring 2: largest number = \(5^2 = 25\)
- Ring 3: largest number = \(7^2 = 49\)
- ...
- Ring \(n\): largest number = \((2n+1)^2\)

We want the ring \(n\) such that:

\[
(2n-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2n+1)^2
\]

because the previous ring ended at \((2n-1)^2\).

Calculate:

- \(44^2 = 1936\)
- \(45^2 = 2025\)
- \(46^2 = 2116\)

So:

- \(44^2 = 1936 < 2026 \le 45^2=2025\) ... no, 2026 > 2025
- \(45^2=2025 < 2026 \le 46^2=2116\) here \(46\) is even, but the formula uses odd numbers.

Because side lengths must be odd: \(2n+1\) is odd.

Check \(45^2 = 2025 < 2026 \le 47^2 = 2209\)

So ring with side length 47 corresponds to:

\[
(2n + 1) = 47 \implies n = \frac{47 - 1}{2} = 23
\]

- Ring 22 ends at \(45^2 = 2025\)
- Ring 23 ends at \(47^2 = 2209\)

So 2026 is in ring \(n=23\).

---

### Step 2b: Determine the side length and the first number of ring 23

- Side length of ring 23 is \(2 \times 23 + 1 = 47\).
- The last number of ring 22 is \(45^2 = 2025\).
- Hence, the first number of ring 23 is 2026.

---

### Step 2c: Identify the ring coordinates boundaries

The coordinates of ring 23 go from:

- x and y in \([-23, 23]\)
- The ring forms a square shell with side length 47 centered at (0,0).

---

### Step 2d: How numbers proceed in ring n?

The spiral pattern (starting from the last number of previous ring \( (2n-1)^2 \)) proceeds like this for ring \(n\):

- Starts right next square coordinate (n, -(n-1))? 
- Actually, the last number of ring \(n-1\) is at position \((n-1, -(n-1))\), and the first number of ring \(n\) is at \((n, - (n-1))\). 

(From known formulas for these spirals.)

For ring \(n\):

- Start at coordinate \((n, -(n-1))\) with number \((2n - 1)^2 + 1\).

---

Let's verify with a smaller \(n=1\):

- \(n=1\)
- Start number at ring 1: \((2*1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2\)
- Start coordinate: \((1, -(1-1)) = (1, 0)\)
- Number 2 is at (1,0) (matches initial spiral)

---

### Step 2e: Coordinates for ring 23 start:

- Number \(2026 = (2*23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\)
- Coordinates: \((23, -(23-1)) = (23, -22)\)

So \(2026\) is at \((23, -22)\).

---

### Step 3: How do numbers go along the ring?

For each ring \(n\), the path of numbers goes **up**, then **left**, then **down**, then **right** around the square:

Each side has length \(2n\) (because the total side length is \(2n + 1\) but one corner is shared by previous ring).

Sequence in ring \(n\) (starting at \((n, -(n-1))\)):

- Up: \(2n\) steps
- Left: \(2n\) steps
- Down: \(2n\) steps
- Right: \(2n\) steps

Total steps: \(8n\) steps.

Number count in ring \(n\) is \( (2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 8n\), which matches the total steps around a ring.

---

### Step 4: Find neighbors of \(2026\) at \((23, -22)\)

Neighbors are the 8 surrounding positions:

\[
(x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), \\
(x-1, y), \quad\quad\quad (x+1, y), \\
(x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1) \\
\]

---

### Step 5: Find the number at a general coordinate \((x,y)\)

We need a formula to find the number at \((x,y)\).

---

### Step 5a: Determine the ring \(n\) for \((x,y)\):

\[
n = \max(|x|, |y|)
\]

because the ring number equals the maximum of the absolute values of coordinates.

---

### Step 5b: Find total count up to previous ring:

\[
\text{max number in prev ring} = (2n - 1)^2
\]

---

### Step 5c: Calculate the offset from start of ring \(n\)

Coordinates of ring \(n\) range from \(-n\) to \(+n\).

The spiral number along ring \(n\) starts at:

\[
(2n - 1)^2 + 1
\]

at \((n, -(n-1))\), moving:

- Up along \(x = n\), from \((n, -(n-1))\) to \((n, n)\) (distance \(d: 0 \to 2n-1\))
- Left along \(y = n\), from \((n, n)\) to \((-n, n)\) (distance \(d: 2n \to 4n - 1\))
- Down along \(x = -n\), from \((-n, n)\) to \((-n, -n)\) (distance \(d: 4n \to 6n -1\))
- Right along \(y = -n\), from \((-n, -n)\) to \((n, -(n-1))\) (distance \(d: 6n \to 8n - 1\))

---

### Step 5d: Calculate offset \(d\) along the ring based on \((x,y)\)

- If \(x = n\) and \(y\) in \([-(n-1), n]\):

\[
d = y + (n - 1)
\]

(steps going upward)

- If \(y = n\) and \(x\) in \([ -n, n-1]\):

\[
d = (2n - 1) + (n - x)
\]

(steps going left)

- If \(x = -n\) and \(y\) in \([-n, n-1]\):

\[
d = (4n - 1) + (n - y)
\]

(steps going down)

- If \(y = -n\) and \(x\) in \([ -n + 1, n-1]\):

\[
d = (6n - 1) + (x + n)
\]

(steps going right)

---

### Step 5e: The position number at \((x,y)\) is:

\[
\text{number} = (2n - 1)^2 + d + 1
\]

---

### Step 6: Verify with example number 2026 at \((23,-22)\)

- \(n = \max(|23|, |-22|) = 23\)
- Since \(y = -22\), and \(y = -n+1 = -23+1 = -22\), and \(x = 23\), we check which case it fits:

\(y = -n + 1 = -22\) but this does not fit exactly.

Check if \(y = -n\):

\(y = -23\)? No, y = -22

Is \(x = n\) and \(y \in [-(n-1), n]\)?

\(x = 23\), \(y \in [-22, 23]\) yes, fits this case.

Using:

\[
d = y + (n-1) = -22 + 22 = 0
\]

Calculate number:

\[
(2*23 -1)^2 + d + 1 = 45^2 + 0 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026
\]

Perfect!

---

### Step 7: Calculate the neighbors' numbers

Neighbors' coordinates:

| dx | dy | Coordinate       |
|-----|-----|-----------------|
| -1  | -1  | (22, -23)       |
| 0   | -1  | (23, -23)       |
| +1  | -1  | (24, -23)       |
| -1  | 0   | (22, -22)       |
| +1  | 0   | (24, -22)       |
| -1  | +1  | (22, -21)       |
| 0   | +1  | (23, -21)       |
| +1  | +1  | (24, -21)       |

We compute the number at each.

---

### Step 7a: Calculate the ring \(n\) for each neighbor and then the number

---

1. Coordinate (22, -23):

- \(n = \max(|22|,| -23|) = 23\)
- \(y = -23 = -n\)
- \(x = 22\) which is in \([-n+1, n-1] = [-22, 22]\) true.
- So this is the case:

\[
y = -n = -23
\]

Use "right" side formula:

\[
d = (6n - 1) + (x + n) = (6*23 - 1) + (22 + 23) = (138 - 1) + 45 = 137 + 45 = 182
\]

Number:

\[
(2n - 1)^2 + d + 1 = 45^2 + 182 + 1 = 2025 + 182 + 1 = 2208
\]

---

2. Coordinate (23, -23):

- \(n = \max(|23|, 23) = 23\), \(y = -23 = -n\), \(x = 23\)

- \(x = n\), but "right" side for \(y = -n\) only covers \(x \in [-n+1, n-1]\). Here \(x = n\), not in the range.

- Since \(x = n\) and \(y = -n\), the corner point

Let's see if any case fits:

Borders:

- Up: \(x=n, y \in [-(n-1), n]\) → \(y \geq -22\), no because \(y=-23\)
- Left: \(y=n=23\), no \(y=-23\)
- Down: \(x=-n=-23\), no \(x=23\)
- Right: \(y=-n=-23\), \(x \in [-n+1, n-1] = [-22, 22]\), but \(x=23\) is out of this range.

Hence, the point (23, -23) is not on ring 23 but on ring \(n = \max(|23|,|-23|) = 23\), but since \(x=23\) and \(y=-23\), and \(x = n\), \(y = -n\), it is the bottom right corner.

According to the spiral, the start position at ring 23 is at (23,-22).

The corner points last positions correspond to last positions in the ring.

The last step of ring \(n\) is \(8n-1 = 183\) steps (0-based).

The distance \(d\) from start is 183 for bottom-right corner (where the ring started).

Calculate:

- \(d = 8n - 1 = 8 \times 23 -1 = 184 -1 =183\)
- Number:

\[
(2n - 1)^2 + d + 1 = 2025 + 183 + 1 = 2209
\]

So (23, -23) corresponds to 2209.

---

3. Coordinate (24, -23):

- \(n = \max(|24|,| -23|) = 24\)

This means (24,-23) is in ring 24.

Calculate number at ring 24:

- Max ring 23 number = \( (2*23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \)

- Ring 24 starts at \(2209 + 1 = 2210\)
- Starting coordinate ring 24:

\[
(n, -(n-1)) = (24, -23)
\]

This coordinate matches starting point for ring 24, so number = 2210.

---

4. Coordinate (22, -22):

- \(n = \max(|22|, |-22|) = 22\)

- \(y = -22 = -n\), \(x=22\)

For \(n=22\):

- Side \(y = -n = -22\), \(x \in [-21, 21]\)? \(x=22\) no, \(22 > 21\), so \(x=22\) is outside ring 22.

Check ring 23 if \(n=23\):

- \(n=23\), but \(\max(|22|,| -22 |)=22\), so ring 22 holds.

Our coordinate is outside of ring 22 boundary?

For ring 22:

- Coordinates range in \([-22, 22]\):
- \(x=22\), \(y = -22\) is valid on ring 22 boundary.

On ring 22, \(y = -n = -22\), and \(x = 22\), which is max x.

Check position in ring 22:

- Since \(y = -n\) and \(x\) in \([-n+1, n-1]\) means \([-21, 21]\). \(x=22\) is greater than 21, so invalid on ring 22.

Check ring 23:

- \(n=23\), \(x=22\), \(y = -22\), max(|22|,| -22|) = 22 < 23

Hence \(n=22\) ring

But \(x=22\) is on the boundary of ring 22.

We need to check if \(x = n\), which is 22 here.

Since \(x=22 = n\), \(y = -22\), check if:

- Up side: \(x=n=22\), \(y \in [-(n-1), n] = [-21, 22]\): \(y = -22\) no
- Right side: \(y=-n=-22\), \(x \in [-n+1, n-1] = [-21, 21]\): \(x=22\), no
- Hence, this coordinate might be corner of ring 22 or outside?

If \(x=n=22\) and \(y=-n=-22\), i.e. (22,-22), the corner point.

Distance \(d = 8n-1 = 8*22-1=176-1=175\).

Number:

\[
(2n -1)^2 + d + 1 = 43^2 + 175 + 1 = 1849 + 176 = 2025
\]

This matches the last number of ring 22, which we know is 2025.

Ok this fits.

---

5. Coordinate \( (24, -22) \):

- \(n = 24\)

Ring 24 start at \((24, -23)\) is number 2210

\(y = -22\)

Check d in ring 24:

- \(y = -22\), which is \(y = -n + 1 = -23 + 1 = -22\).

Hence on side "right" of ring 24.

From formula for "right" side:

\[
d = (6n -1) + (x + n) = (6*24 -1) + (24 + 24) = (144 - 1) + 48 = 143 + 48 = 191
\]

Number in ring 24:

\[
(2*24 -1)^2 + d + 1 = 47^2 + 191 + 1 = 2209 + 192 = 2401
\]

Wait, \(47^2 = 2209\) is ring 23 last number.

Ring 24 last number is:

\[
(2*24 + 1)^2 = 49^2 = 2401
\]

So 2401 is the max ring 24 number.

Hence point at \(d=191\) in ring 24 is indeed \(2401\).

So number at (24, -22) is 2401.

---

6. Coordinate (22, -21):

- \(n = \max(|22|, | -21|)=22\)

- \(x = 22 = n\), 

- Check if \(y \in [-(n-1), n] = [-21, 22]\), \(y = -21\) ok.

Ring 22 "up" side:

\[
d = y + (n -1) = -21 + 21 = 0
\]

Number:

\[
(2*22 -1)^2 + d + 1 = 43^2 + 0 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850
\]

---

7. Coordinate (23, -21):

- \(n= \max(|23|, 21) =23\)

- \(x=23=n\)

- \(y = -21 \in [-(n-1), n] = [-22, 23]\)

Ring 23 "up" side:

\[
d = y + (n -1) = -21 + 22 = 1
\]

Number:

\[
(2*23 -1)^2 + 1 + 1 = 45^2 + 2 = 2025 + 2 = 2027
\]

---

8. Coordinate (24, -21):

- \(n = 24\)

- \(y = -21\)

Check if "right" side: \(y = -n = -24\)? No

"up": \(x = n = 24\), \(y \in [-(n-1), n]\) i.e. \([-23, 24]\) \(y=-21\) in.

Hence "up" side ring 24:

\[
d = y + (n -1) = -21 + 23 = 2
\]

Number:

\[
(2*24 -1)^2 + d + 1 = 47^2 + 2 + 1 = 2209 + 3 = 2212
\]

---

### Step 8: Summary of neighbors' numbers

| Coordinate | n  | d  | Number |
|------------|----|----|--------|
| (22,-23)   | 23 |182 | 2208   |
| (23,-23)   | 23 |183 | 2209   |
| (24,-23)   | 24 |0   | 2210   |
| (22,-22)   | 22 |175 | 2025   |
| (24,-22)   | 24 |191 | 2401   |
| (22,-21)   | 22 |0   | 1850   |
| (23,-21)   | 23 |1   | 2027   |
| (24,-21)   | 24 |2   | 2212   |

---

### Step 9: Calculate the sum of all neighbors

\[
2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2025 + 2401 + 1850 + 2027 + 2212
\]

Calculate step-by-step:

- \(2208 + 2209 = 4417\)
- \(4417 + 2210 = 6627\)
- \(6627 + 2025 = 8652\)
- \(8652 + 2401 = 11053\)
- \(11053 + 1850 = 12903\)
- \(12903 + 2027 = 14930\)
- \(14930 + 2212 = 17142\)

---

### **Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{17142}
\]

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **17142**.
