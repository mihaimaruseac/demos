First, let's carefully analyze the problem:

We have natural numbers arranged in a spiral on a square grid like this:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

The center is 1 at coordinate (0,0). The numbers spiral outwards like this:

- Start at 1 at (0,0).
- 2 is at (1,0).
- 3 is at (1,1).
- 4 is at (0,1).
- 5 is at (-1,1).
- 6 is at (-1,0).
- 7 is at (-1,-1).
- 8 is at (0,-1).
- 9 is at (1,-1).
- etc.

So the spiral starts going right, then up, then left, then down, and so on in layers.

---

### Step 1: Understand Spiral Coordinates Mapping

We need to find coordinates for number 2026, or given coordinates find the number.

From the example, the spiral is arranged layer by layer on successive squares.

Typically, the spiral can be defined in "rings". The ring 0 is just 1 at (0, 0).

Ring 1 surrounds ring 0 forming a 3x3 square, ring 2 surrounds ring 1 forming 5x5, etc.

---

### Step 2: Identify ring of 2026

The spiral ring number \( n \) corresponds to numbers up to \((2n+1)^2\).

- Ring 0: side length \(1\), max number: \(1^2 = 1\)
- Ring 1: side length \(3\), max number: \(3^2 = 9\)
- Ring 2: side length \(5\), max number: \(5^2 = 25\)
- Ring \(k\): side length \(2k+1\), max number: \((2k+1)^2\)

We want to find ring \(k\) such that:

\[
(2(k-1)+1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2
\]

Calculate:

- For \(k=21\):

\[
(2\cdot 21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 < 2026
\]

- For \(k=22\):

\[
(2\cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 < 2026
\]

- For \(k=23\):

\[
(2\cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \geq 2026
\]

So 2026 is within ring \(k=23\).

---

### Step 3: Find position of 2026 in ring 23

The maximum number in ring 22 is:

\[
(2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
\]

So ring 23 starts at 2026 up to 2209.

---

The side length of ring 23 is \(2 \times 23 + 1 = 47\).

The ring forms the outer 47x47 square minus the 45x45 inner square.

- Numbers in ring 23: \(2209 - 2025 = 184\) numbers.

This ring has 184 numbers arranged on the perimeter of the 47x47 square. The perimeter length is:

\[
4 \times (47 - 1) = 4 \times 46 = 184
\]

Exactly 184 numbers.

---

### Step 4: Assign coordinates for ring 23

The ring corresponds to locations with x or y coordinate either \(+23\) or \(-23\).

The spiral starts (from ring \(k\)) at position \((k, -k+1)\) with number \((2k-1)^2 + 1\).

- For \(k=23\), start at:

\[
(23, -22), \quad \text{number} = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026
\]

So:

- Number 2026 at coordinate \((23, -22)\).

The spiral moves counter-clockwise around the ring.

Sequence of edges:

1. Up along x = 23, y from -22 up to +23 (46 steps)
2. Left along y=23, x from 23 down to -23 (46 steps)
3. Down along x = -23, y from 23 down to -23 (46 steps)
4. Right along y = -23, x from -23 up to 22 (last 46 steps)

---

### Step 5: Find coordinates of neighbors of 2026

Neighbors include the 8 adjacent cells:

\[
(x-1,y+1), (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1) \\
(x-1,y), \quad \quad (x+1,y) \\
(x-1,y-1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y-1)
\]

For \(2026\) at \((23, -22)\), neighbors are:

- \( (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21) \)
- \( (22, -22), \quad \quad (24, -22) \)
- \( (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23) \)

But note edges:

- x and y values are bounded by \(\pm23\).
- \(24\) is outside the ring boundary so positions with x=24 do not exist.

Thus neighbors with \(x=24\) are outside the spiral.

Remove neighbors with \(x=24\):

- \( (24, -21) \)
- \( (24, -22) \)
- \( (24, -23) \)

These three neighbors do not exist.

Neighbors to consider:

\[
(22, -21), (23, -21), (22, -22), (22, -23), (23, -23)
\]

---

### Step 6: Find numbers at neighbors positions

Let's write the coordinates and find their numbers.

We need the function \(f(x,y) = \text{number at } (x,y)\).

---

### Step 7: General formula for number at \((x,y)\)

Given \(k = \max(|x|, |y|)\).

Ring \(k\) minimum number is:

\[
(2k - 1)^2 + 1
\]

The ring has \(8k\) numbers.

In the ring \(k\), the path starts at \((k, -k+1)\) number \((2k-1)^2 + 1\), then moves:

1. Up along the right edge: from \((k, -k+1)\) up to \((k,k)\) (length = \(2k -1\))
2. Left along top: from \((k,k)\) to \((-k,k)\) (length = \(2k\))
3. Down along left: from \((-k,k)\) to \((-k,-k)\) (length = \(2k\))
4. Right along bottom: from \((-k,-k)\) to \((k,-k)\) (length = \(2k\))

Positions on Ring (total length \(8k\)):

- Position 0 at \((k, -k + 1)\)
- Positions 0 to \(2k-1\): up edge, increasing y by 1 each step.
- Positions \(2k\) to \(4k-1\): top edge, decreasing x by 1 each step.
- Positions \(4k\) to \(6k-1\): left edge, decreasing y by 1 each step.
- Positions \(6k\) to \(8k-1\): bottom edge, increasing x by 1 each step.

---

### Step 8: Determine the offset along the ring for a coordinate \((x,y)\)

- If \(x = k\) and \(y > -k\), **up edge**:

\[
\text{offset} = y - (-k + 1) = y + k - 1
\]

- If \(y = k\) and \(x < k\), **top edge**:

\[
\text{offset} = (2k - 1) + (k - x)
\]

- If \(x = -k\) and \(y < k\), **left edge**:

\[
\text{offset} = (2k - 1) + 2k + (k - y) = 4k -1 + k - y = 5k -1 - y
\]

- If \(y = -k\) and \(x > -k\), **bottom edge**:

\[
\text{offset} = (2k - 1) + 2k + 2k + (x + k) = 6k -1 + x + k = 7k -1 + x 
\]

Check these carefully.

Let me summarize the offset computations with detailed explanation:

---

### Edge 1 (Up edge):

- Positions along y from \(-k+1\) to \(k\).
- Number of positions: \(2k - 1\).
- Offset \(= y - (-k +1) = y + k -1\).

Positions: 0 to \(2k-1\).

Check length: max \(y = k\), so offset max:

\[
k + k -1 = 2k -1
\]

Matches length.

---

### Edge 2 (Top edge):

- Positions along x from \(k-1\) down to \(-k\).
- Number of positions: \(2k\).
- Offset starts after Up edge, so offset base is \(2k -1\).
- Offset \( = (2k -1) + (k - x) \).

At \(x = k\), offset = \(2k - 1 + 0 = 2k -1\).

At \(x = -k\), offset = \(2k -1 + 2k = 4k - 1\).

---

### Edge 3 (Left edge):

- Positions along y from \(k - 1\) down to \(-k\).
- Number of positions: \(2k\).
- Offset base is \(4k -1\).
- Offset \(= (4k -1) + (k - y) = 5k -1 - y\).

At \(y = k\), offset = \(4k -1 + 0 = 4k -1\).

At \(y = -k\), offset = \(4k -1 + 2k = 6k -1\).

---

### Edge 4 (Bottom edge):

- Positions along x from \(-k + 1\) up to \(k\).
- Number of positions: \(2k\).
- Offset base is \(6k -1\).
- Offset \(= (6k -1) + (x + k) = 7k -1 + x\).

At \(x = -k\), offset = \(6k -1 + 0 = 6k -1\).

At \(x = k\), offset = \(6k -1 + 2k = 8k -1\).

---

### Final number:

\[
\text{number} = (2k - 1)^2 + 1 + \text{offset}
\]

---

### Step 9: Calculate \(k\) and number for neighbors

Given neighbors:

1. \( (22, -21) \)

Calculate \(k = \max(|22|, |-21|) = 22\).

Since \(k=22\),

- Check edge:

\(x = 22\), \(y = -21\).

Since \(x = k = 22\) and \(y > -k = -22\) (since \(y = -21 > -22\)), edge is **up edge**.

Offset:

\[
y + k -1 = -21 + 22 -1 = 0
\]

Number at (22, -21) is:

\[
(2k -1)^2 + 1 + offset = (43)^2 + 1 + 0 = 1849 + 1 + 0 = 1850
\]

---

2. \( (23, -21) \)

\(k = \max(23, 21) = 23\).

Check edge:

- \(x = 23 = k\), \(y = -21 > -23\) (since \(-21 > -23\) true)
- Up edge.

Offset:

\[
y + k -1 = -21 + 23 - 1 = 1
\]

Number:

\[
(2\cdot 23 -1)^2 + 1 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 + 1 = 2025 + 2 = 2027
\]

---

3. \( (22, -22) \)

\(k=22\), since \(\max(|22|, |-22|) = 22\).

Check edge:

- \(x = 22 = k\), \(y = -22 = -k\).

Is \(y > -k\)? No, it equals \(-k\).

So not on up edge, but \(y = -k\) and \(x > -k\) means **bottom edge**.

Offset:

\[
7k -1 + x = 7 \times 22 -1 + 22 = 154 -1 + 22 = 175
\]

Number:

\[
(2k -1)^2 + 1 + offset = (43)^2 + 1 + 175 = 1849 + 1 + 175 = 2025
\]

---

4. \( (22, -23) \)

\(k = \max(22, 23) = 23\).

\(x=22 \neq \pm k\), \(y = -23 = -k\).

So on bottom edge for ring 23.

Bottom edge offset:

\[
7k -1 + x = 7 \times 23 -1 + 22 = 161 -1 + 22 = 182
\]

Number:

\[
(2k-1)^2 + 1 + offset = 45^2 + 1 + 182 = 2025 + 1 + 182 = 2208
\]

---

5. \( (23, -23) \)

\(k = \max(23, 23) = 23\).

\(x=23 = k\), \(y = -23 = -k\).

We need to check which edge fits this.

- \(y=-k\), \(x=k\)

On bottom edge, at the max x.

Bottom edge offset is:

\[
7k -1 + x = 7 \times 23 -1 + 23 = 161 -1 + 23 = 183
\]

Number:

\[
2025 + 1 + 183 = 2209
\]

---

### Step 10: Confirm neighbors' numbers:

| Coordinate | k  | Edge       | Offset   | Number |
|------------|----|------------|----------|--------|
| (22,-21)   | 22 | up edge    | 0        | 1850   |
| (23,-21)   | 23 | up edge    | 1        | 2027   |
| (22,-22)   | 22 | bottom edge| 175      | 2025   |
| (22,-23)   | 23 | bottom edge| 182      | 2208   |
| (23,-23)   | 23 | bottom edge| 183      | 2209   |

---

### Step 11: Sum the neighbor numbers

Sum:

\[
1850 + 2027 + 2025 + 2208 + 2209 = ?
\]

Calculate step by step:

- \(1850 + 2027 = 3877\)
- \(3877 + 2025 = 5902\)
- \(5902 + 2208 = 8110\)
- \(8110 + 2209 = 10319\)

---

### Final answer:

\[
\boxed{10319}
\]

---

# **Answer:**

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 in the spiral is **10319**.
