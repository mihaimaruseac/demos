We are given a spiral of natural numbers, laid out on a square grid. From the small portion provided:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

So the natural numbers are arranged in a **spiral pattern**, starting with 1 at the center and spiraling clockwise outward. From the pattern given, we can infer it spirals like this:

```
17 16 15 14 13
18  5  4  3 12
19  6  1  2 11
20  7  8  9 10
21 22 23 24 25
```

This is known as the **Ulam spiral** or a **number spiral**.

Our task is to find the **sum of all 8 neighbors** (surrounding numbers) of **2026** in the Ulam spiral.

---

### Step 1: Find the coordinates of 2026 in the spiral

We need a way to compute the position (x, y) of a certain number in the spiral, or vice versa.

Rather than generating the full spiral to 2026, we can observe a methodical approach.

Let’s note:

- The spiral forms concentric "squares".
- Center (0, 0) holds 1
- Each time we go one layer outward, we create a square with side length = odd number: 1, 3, 5, ..., \(2n + 1\)
- The **maximum number in layer n** is \((2n + 1)^2\), which is at position \((n, -n)\)
- Layer 0: from 1 to 1
- Layer 1: from 2 to \(3^2 = 9\)
- Layer 2: from 10 to \(5^2 = 25\)
- Layer 3: from 26 to \(7^2 = 49\)
- ...
- Let us compute the layer in which 2026 lies.

---

### Step 2: Find the "layer" of 2026

Since the maximum number in layer n is \((2n+1)^2\), we find the smallest \(n\) such that \((2n+1)^2 \geq 2026\)

Let’s solve:
\[
(2n+1)^2 \ge 2026
\Rightarrow 2n + 1 \ge \sqrt{2026}
\Rightarrow 2n + 1 \ge 44.997
\Rightarrow 2n \ge 43.997
\Rightarrow n \ge 21.998
\Rightarrow n = 22
\]

So 2026 lies in **layer 22**

So the side length = \(2n+1 = 45\), this square spiral goes from \((2(n-1)+1)^2 + 1 = (43)^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850\) to \(45^2 = 2025\)

Wait — this gives from 1850 to 2025 for numbers in layer 22.

But **2026 is not in layer 22**, because max = 2025 in that layer. So 2026 is the **first number in layer 23**

Check: Layer 23 has side length = \(2×23+1 = 47\)

Then the maximum number in layer 23 is \(47^2 = 2209\)

And the minimum number is \(45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\)

So 2026 is the **first number in layer 23**

Each new layer starts at position: move right from bottom-right corner of previous.

Note:

- Layer n starts at number: \((2(n-1)+1)^2 + 1 = (2n - 1)^2 + 1\)
- So 2026 is at the beginning of layer 23: that is position \((23, -22)\)

---

### Step 3: Find coordinates of 2026

We now find the exact coordinates of 2026 in the spiral.

We know:

- The largest number of layer n is at \((n, -n)\), i.e., bottom-right corner of the square
- For layer 23, maximum number is \(47^2 = 2209\) at \((23, -23)\)
- From there, going around the square counter-clockwise:

We can trace backward from 2209 to 2026

Each side of the square is of length 47

There are 4 sides, so 4 segments of 46 steps (since corners are shared)

So moving backward:

- From 2209 (bottom-right corner at (23, -23)) going **left** along the bottom side → 46 steps ending at \((-23, -23)\)
- Then go **up** to \((-23, 23)\)
- Then go **right** to \((23, 23)\)
- Then go **down** to \((23, -22) ← this is the **first** number (2026) of layer 23**

So:

- 2026 is at \((23, -22)\)

---

### Step 4: Now find the 8 neighbors of (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors are at:

```
(x-1, y+1) = (22, -21)
(x,   y+1) = (23, -21)
(x+1, y+1) = (24, -21)
(x-1, y)   = (22, -22)
(x+1, y)   = (24, -22)
(x-1, y-1) = (22, -23)
(x,   y-1) = (23, -23)
(x+1, y-1) = (24, -23)
```

So now we need to determine the numbers located at these coordinates.

Let’s write a function, or algorithm, to compute the number at position (x, y) in the spiral.

---

### Step 5: Function to get the number at (x, y)

We'll adopt the formula based on coordinate (x, y). This is known from Ulam spiral structure.

Given any coordinate (x, y), we find the **"layer"** it belongs to:

\[
n = \max(|x|, |y|)
\]

Then:

- The maximum number in this layer is \((2n+1)^2\), located at corner (n, -n)
- Then the numbers decrease as we go counter-clockwise from there.

Each side has length \(2n\)

Now, for point (x, y), depending on which side it's on, we calculate its offset from the maximum.

Let’s define this step-by-step:

---

### Determine position number at (x, y)

Set \(n = \max(|x|, |y|)\), layer number

Let \(maxNum = (2n+1)^2\)

Then:

#### If (x, y) is on the **right** edge: \(x = n\)
- y goes from \(-n\) (bottom) to \(n\) (top)
- Offset = \(0 + (y + n)\)
- Number = \(maxNum - offset\)

#### If on **top** edge: \(y = n\), x from n to -n
- Offset = \(2n + (n - x)\)
- Number = \(maxNum - offset\)

#### If on **left** edge: \(x = -n\), y from n to -n
- Offset = \(4n + (n - y)\)
- Number = \(maxNum - offset\)

#### If on **bottom** edge: \(y = -n\), x from -n to n
- Offset = \(6n + (x + n)\)
- Number = \(maxNum - offset\)

Let’s use this to compute the spiral number at each neighbor.

---

### Neighbor (22, -21)

- n = max(22, 21) = 22
- maxNum = (2×22 +1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025
- (x=22, y= -21), y ≠ ±22, but x = 22 ⇒ not on an edge? Check:
    - On **right edge**: x = 22 (equals n)
    - y from -22 to 22 ==> yes

So it's on right edge.

- offset = 0 + (y + n) = y + 22 = -21 + 22 = 1
- Value = 2025 - 1 = 2024

✅ So (22, -21) → 2024

---

### (23, -21)

n = max(|23|, |21|) = 23  
maxNum = (2×23+1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209  
(x=23, y=-21): x = 23 = n ⇒ on right edge  
Offset = y + n = -21 + 23 = 2  
Value = 2209 - 2 = **2207**

---

### (24, -21)

n = 24  
maxNum = 49^2 = 2401  
x = 24 (= n) ⇒ right edge  
Offset = -21 + 24 = 3  
Value = 2401 - 3 = **2398**

---

### (22, -22)

n = 22  
max = 2025  
x = 22 → right edge  
y = -22  
Offset = -22 + 22 = 0  
Value = 2025 - 0 = 2025

---

### (24, -22)

n = 24  
max = 2401  
x = 24, y = -22  
Offset = -22 + 24 = 2  
Value = 2401 - 2 = 2399

---

### (22, -23)

n = 23  
max = 2209  
x = 22 ≠ ±23, y = -23 ⇒ on bottom edge  
Check: y = -n ⇒ bottom edge!  
x goes from -n to n ⇒ -23 to 23

Offset = 6n + (x + n) = 6×23 + (22 + 23) = 138 + 45 = 183  
Value = 2209 - 183 = **2026**

(That's our target! Makes sense.)

---

### (23, -23)

x = 23, y = -23 ⇒ x = n = y = -n ⇒ bottom right corner  
Offset = 6n + (x + n) = 6×23 + (23 + 23) = 138 + 46 = 184  
Value = 2209 - 184 = 2025

---

### (24, -23)

n = 24  
max = 2401  
Check if on bottom edge: y = -24 = -n ⇒ yes  
Offset = 6n + (x + n) = 144 + (24 + 24) = 144 + 48 = **192**  
Value = 2401 - 192 = **2209**

---

### Now sum all 8 neighbors:

They are:

- (22, -21) → 2024  
- (23, -21) → 2207  
- (24, -21) → 2398  
- (22, -22) → 2025  
- (24, -22) → 2399  
- (22, -23) → 2026  
- (23, -23) → 2025  
- (24, -23) → 2209

Add them all:

\[
2024 + 2207 = 4231  
4231 + 2398 = 6629  
6629 + 2025 = 8654  
8654 + 2399 = 11,053  
11,053 + 2026 = 13,079  
13,079 + 2025 = 15,104  
15,104 + 2209 = **17,313**
\]

✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{17313}
\]
