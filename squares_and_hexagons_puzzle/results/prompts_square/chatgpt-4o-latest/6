We are told that natural numbers are placed on a square spiral, like the one shown:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

This spiral goes counter-clockwise starting at 1 in the center:

```
Layer 0: 1
Layer 1:
   9  8  7
   2  1  6
   3  4  5
```

We are to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of **2026** in this spiral pattern.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Spiral Pattern

This pattern can also be thought of as a square spiral starting from 1 and going counterclockwise:

- Center is 1 at (0, 0)
- Then it spirals: right → up → left → down → right → up ... (counterclockwise spiral)

We can think of the spiral as being in layers (like onion layers), where layer 0 has just 1, layer 1 goes from 2 to 9, layer 2 goes from 10 to 25, etc.

The numbers at the bottom right corners of each square layer are perfect squares:
- Layer 0 ends at \(1 = 1^2\)
- Layer 1 ends at \(9 = 3^2\)
- Layer 2 ends at \(25 = 5^2\)
- Layer 3 ends at \(49 = 7^2\)
- Layer n ends at \((2n + 1)^2\)

So for number 2026, we try to find which layer it is in.

---

### Step 2: Find the Layer of 2026

We are looking for the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[
(2n+1)^2 \geq 2026
\]

Try a few values:

- \( \sqrt{2026} \approx 45 \), so \( 45^2 = 2025 < 2026 \)
- \( 46^2 = 2116 > 2026 \)

So 2026 is in layer \( n \) where \( 2n + 1 = 45 \Rightarrow n = 22 \)

That means it's located in the 22nd layer.

Layer 22:
- Starts just after layer 21, which ends at \( (2 \cdot 21 + 1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849 \)
- So layer 22 starts at 1850
- Ends at \( (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025 \)

But 2026 is actually in **layer 23**!

Check:
- \( 46^2 = 2116 \) → Layer 23 ends at 2116
- \( 44^2 = 1936 \), \( 45^2 = 2025 \)

So:

- 2026 is **just after 2025**, which is the bottom-right corner of layer 22
- So **2026 is the first number in layer 23**

Since 2025 is at corner, 2026 comes right after that — that is, it starts the next layer (Layer 23).

---

### Step 3: Find the coordinates of 2026

We now attempt to determine coordinate positions of numbers in spiral.

Let’s define the spiral with coordinates:

- The center (number 1) is at (0, 0)
- The movement is: right → up → left → down → right → up ... and so on.

Let’s try to find the coordinates of number 2026.

Because it's the **first number** in Layer 23, and each layer goes around as a square border of thickness 1, we can find the length of the side of layer 23:

- Side length = \( 2n + 1 = 47 \) for layer 23
- The total number of numbers in the spiral up to layer 23: \(47^2 = 2209\)
- The count of numbers before it: \(45^2 = 2025\)
- So numbers 2026 to 2209 are in layer 23
- Total numbers in the layer: \(2209 - 2025 = 184\)

On the spiral, the movement of the outer layer goes as:

- Start at position (n, -n+1) [just after bottom-right]
- Move left along bottom side: side_len - 1 = 46 steps
- Move up: 46 steps
- Move right: 46 steps
- Move down: 46 steps

Let’s determine initial position.

In layer 23 (n = 23):

- Bottom-right corner (ending number of layer 22) is at position (23, -23)
- Next number 2026 will be to the left ⇒ at (22, -23)

So 2026 is at position (22, -23)

---

### Step 4: Find Neighbors of 2026

Now that we know the coordinate of 2026 is (22, -23), its 8 neighbors are the points:

- (21, -24), (22, -24), (23, -24)
- (21, -23),          (23, -23)
- (21, -22), (22, -22), (23, -22)

So we must find the numbers at each of these positions.

We can define a function that returns the number at (x, y).

---

### Step 5: Build Formula to Get Number at (x, y)

Let’s find a systematic way to determine the number at coordinate (x, y)

Idea: For any coordinate (x, y), we can determine the "layer" it's in: this is:

\[
n = \max(|x|, |y|)
\]

- Then determine the spiral traversal to get to that point

We use the formula (based on known square spiral formulas):

Let’s define a function f(x, y) that gives the number at (x, y)

For a given n = max(|x|,|y|):

- The maximum number in the layer is: \( M = (2n+1)^2 \)
- The 4 sides of the square are (each of length 2n):

Starting from the bottom-right corner and going counter-clockwise:

- Right edge from (n, -n) up to (n, n): 2n steps
- Top edge from (n, n) to (-n, n): 2n steps
- Left edge from (-n, n) to (-n, -n): 2n steps
- Bottom edge from (-n, -n) to (n, -n): 2n steps

So the traversal is:

- Bottom-right corner (n, -n) → Number: M = (2n+1)^2
- Then decrease by 1 as you go counter-clockwise

Now reverse mapping (x, y) to number:

Depending on which side (x, y) lies on:

- If x = n (right edge): y from -n to n  
\[
\text{Number} = M - (n - y)
\]
- If y = n (top edge): x from n-1 to -n  
\[
\text{Number} = M - (2n) - (n - x)
\]
- If x = -n (left edge): y from n-1 to -n  
\[
\text{Number} = M - (4n) - (n + y)
\]
- If y = -n (bottom edge): x from -n+1 to n  
\[
\text{Number} = M - (6n) - (n + x)
\]

Let’s compute M and values for our 8 neighbors

---

### Step 6: Compute Neighbors of (22, -23)

First, for all 8 neighbors, get their (x, y), n = max(|x|, |y|), and then compute their value.

We’ll compute f(x, y) as per the side-based formula.

#### Neighbor 1: (21, -24)

n = max(21, 24) = 24  
M = (2·24 + 1)² = 49² = 2401  
This point is on the **bottom edge**: y = -n = -24

Then:

- x = 21
- Position along bottom edge: index = n + x = 24 + 21 = 45

Value = M - 6n - (n + x) = 2401 - 6·24 - 45 = 2401 - 144 - 45 = 2212

#### Neighbor 2: (22, -24)

Still n = 24  
x = 22

x + n = 46  

Value = 2401 - 144 - 46 = 2211

#### Neighbor 3: (23, -24)

x = 23 ⇒ x + n = 47  
Value = 2401 - 144 - 47 = 2210

#### Neighbor 4: (21, -23)

n = max(21, 23) = 23  
M = 47² = 2209  
x=21, y=-23 ⇒ y = -n ⇒ bottom edge

x + n = 21 + 23 = 44  
Value = 2209 - 6·23 - 44 = 2209 - 138 - 44 = 2027

#### Neighbor 5: (23, -23)

n = 23  
x=23, y=-23 ⇒ x=n and y = -n ⇒ corner ⇒ number = M = 2209

#### Neighbor 6: (21, -22)

n = max(21, 22) = 22  
M = 45² = 2025  
x=21, y=-22 ⇒ y = -n ⇒ bottom edge

x + n = 21 + 22 = 43  
Value = 2025 - 6·22 - 43 = 2025 - 132 - 43 = 1850

#### Neighbor 7: (22, -22)

n=22  
x=22, y=-22 ⇒ bottom edge  
x + n = 22 + 22 = 44  
Value = 2025 - 132 - 44 = 1849

#### Neighbor 8: (23, -22)

x=23, y=-22 ⇒ bottom edge still  
x + n = 45  
Value = 2025 - 132 - 45 = 1848

---

### Step 7: Sum of Neighbors

Now list the 8 neighbor values:

- 2212
- 2211
- 2210
- 2027
- 2209
- 1850
- 1849
- 1848

Total sum:

\[
2212 + 2211 + 2210 = 6633  
2027 + 2209 = 4236  
1850 + 1849 + 1848 = 5547
\]

Now sum all:

- 6633 + 4236 = 10869  
- 10869 + 5547 = **16416**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{16416}
\]
