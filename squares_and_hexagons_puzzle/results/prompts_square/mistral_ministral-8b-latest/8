Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 in this spiral.

### Understanding the Spiral Pattern

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. Here's a small example based on the given snippet:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the spiral starts at the center with 1, then moves right to 2, up to 3, left to 4, down to 5, then continues outward in a similar pattern. This is a common "Ulam spiral" where numbers increase outward in a square spiral.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of a number like 2026, we first need to determine its position in the grid. Here's how we can approach that:

1. **Identify the Layer (or Ring) of the Number**: The spiral can be thought of as concentric squares or rings around the center. The center is layer 0 (just the number 1). The next layer is a 3x3 square (from 2 to 8), then a 5x5 square (from 9 to 24), and so on.

   - The number of numbers in each layer can be calculated as follows:
     - Layer 0: 1 number (1)
     - Layer 1: 8 numbers (2 to 9)
     - Layer 2: 16 numbers (10 to 24)
     - Layer k: 8k numbers (from the start of the layer to the end)

   - To find out which layer a number N is in, we can find the smallest k such that the sum of the first k layers is at least N.
     - Sum of first k layers: 1 + 8 + 16 + ... + 8k = 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1)
     - We need to find the smallest k where 1 + 4k(k+1) ≥ N.

2. **Find the Starting Number of the Layer**: Once we know k, the starting number of layer k is:
   - For k=0: 1
   - For k>0: 1 + 4(k-1)k + 1 = 4k² - 4k + 2

   Wait, let's derive this properly. The first number in layer k is the first number after layer k-1, which is:
   - First number in layer k = 1 + 4(k-1)k + 1 = 4k² - 4k + 2

   For example:
   - k=1: 4(1) - 4(1) + 2 = 2 (correct, layer 1 starts at 2)
   - k=2: 4(4) - 4(2) + 2 = 16 - 8 + 2 = 10 (correct, layer 2 starts at 10)

3. **Determine the Position Within the Layer**: The position of N within layer k is N - (starting number of layer k) + 1.

4. **Map the Position to Grid Coordinates**: The spiral can be mapped to grid coordinates where the center is (0,0). The layers alternate directions:
   - Layer 0: (0,0)
   - Layer 1: starts at (1,0), then (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)
   - Layer 2: starts at (2,0), then (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,-1)
   - And so on.

   The general pattern is that each layer k has a side length of 2k+1, and the numbers are placed in a square around the previous layer.

### Calculating the Layer for 2026

Let's find out which layer 2026 is in.

We need to find the smallest k where 1 + 4k(k+1) ≥ 2026.

Let's solve 4k(k+1) ≥ 2025 => k(k+1) ≥ 506.25

Approximate k: k² ≈ 506 => k ≈ √506 ≈ 22.5

Try k=22:
4*22*23 = 4*506 = 2024
1 + 2024 = 2025 < 2026

k=23:
4*23*24 = 4*552 = 2208
1 + 2208 = 2209 ≥ 2026

So, 2026 is in layer 23.

Starting number of layer 23:
4*23² - 4*23 + 2 = 4*529 - 92 + 2 = 2116 - 92 + 2 = 2026

Wait, that gives starting number as 2026, which would mean 2026 is the first number in layer 23. But layer 23 starts at 2026, so its position within the layer is 1.

But let's check the starting number formula again.

Alternative approach: sum up layers until we reach or exceed 2026.

Sum up to layer k: S(k) = 1 + 4k(k+1)

Find k where S(k-1) < 2026 ≤ S(k)

We have S(22) = 1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2024 = 2025
S(23) = 1 + 4*23*24 = 1 + 2208 = 2209

So, 2026 is in layer 23, and its position within the layer is 2026 - 2025 = 1 (since layer 23 starts at 2026).

### Determining the Grid Coordinates

Now, let's find the coordinates of 2026 in the grid.

The spiral starts at (0,0) for 1.

Layer 1 (numbers 2 to 9) forms a 3x3 square around the center:
- (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)

Layer 2 (numbers 10 to 24) forms a 5x5 square:
- Starts at (2,0), then moves right to (2,1), (2,2), then up to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2), then left to (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2), then down to (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2), then right to (2,-1)

Similarly, layer k starts at (k,0), then moves right to (k,1), ..., (k,k), then up to (k-1,k), ..., (0,k), (-k,k), then left to (-k,k-1), ..., (-k,0), (-k,-1), ..., (-k,-k), then down to (-k+1,-k), ..., (0,-k), (k,-k), then right to (k,-k+1), ..., (k,-1), and ends at (k,0).

But this seems a bit off because layer 1 is 3x3, layer 2 is 5x5, etc., so layer k is (2k+1) x (2k+1).

The starting point of layer k is (k,0), and the numbers are placed in a square around the previous layer.

Given that, for layer 23, the starting number is at (23,0), and the numbers proceed right to (23,1), ..., (23,23), then up to (22,23), ..., (0,23), (-23,23), then left to (-23,22), ..., (-23,0), (-23,-1), ..., (-23,-23), then down to (-22,-23), ..., (0,-23), (23,-23), then right to (23,-22), ..., (23,-1), and ends at (23,0).

Since 2026 is the first number in layer 23, its position is (23,0).

### Finding the Eight Neighbors

Now, the eight neighbors of (23,0) are:
- Up: (23,1)
- Down: (23,-1)
- Left: (22,0)
- Right: (24,0) — but (24,0) is outside the current layer's bounds, so this might not be a neighbor in the spiral sense. Wait, no, in the grid, neighbors are adjacent squares, so (24,0) is adjacent to (23,0), but in the spiral, the next number after 2026 is 2027, which is at (23,1). So (24,0) is not part of the spiral's immediate neighbors unless it's a number in the next layer's starting point, but the next layer starts at (24,0) for 2209, which is way beyond 2026.

Wait, let's clarify the neighbors. In the grid, the eight neighbors are:
- (23±1, 0±1) and (23, 0±1) and (23±1, 0), but excluding the current position.

So:
1. (23,1)
2. (23,-1)
3. (22,0)
4. (24,0)
5. (23,1) — already listed
6. (23,-1) — already listed
7. (22,1)
8. (22,-1)
9. (24,1)
10. (24,-1)

But actually, the eight neighbors are:
- (23+1, 0) = (24,0)
- (23-1, 0) = (22,0)
- (23, 0+1) = (23,1)
- (23, 0-1) = (23,-1)
- (23+1, 0+1) = (24,1)
- (23+1, 0-1) = (24,-1)
- (23-1, 0+1) = (22,1)
- (23-1, 0-1) = (22,-1)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

### Mapping Grid Coordinates to Numbers

This is the tricky part. We need a way to map any (x,y) to its corresponding number in the spiral.

Given that, let's think about how numbers are assigned in the spiral.

The spiral can be divided into layers where each layer k is a square with side length 2k+1, centered at (0,0).

The starting number of layer k is:
S(k) = 1 + 4*(k-1)*k for k >= 1.

For k=1: S(1)=2
k=2: S(2)=10
k=3: S(3)=26
etc.

The numbers in layer k are from S(k) to S(k)+8k-1.

The position within the layer can be determined by the coordinates (x,y).

The maximum absolute value in layer k is k, so if |x| <= k and |y| <= k, then (x,y) is in layer k.

The order in which numbers are placed in layer k is:
1. Right: (k,0) to (k,k)
2. Up: (k-1,k) to (0,k)
3. Left: (-k,k) to (-k,-k)
4. Down: (-k+1,-k) to (k,-k)
5. Right: (k,-k+1) to (k,0)

But this seems to have some overlaps. Maybe a better approach is to note that the numbers increase as we go around the square.

An alternative is to note that the number at (x,y) can be found by:
- The layer is max(|x|, |y|)
- Then, the position within the layer can be determined by the order in which squares are filled.

This is complex, so perhaps a better approach is to find the number at (x,y) by calculating how many numbers are before it in the spiral.

But given the complexity, let's try to find the numbers at the eight neighbors of (23,0).

Given that (23,0) is the first number in layer 23 (2026), the next number is at (23,1) which is 2027.

Similarly, the previous number in the spiral is at (22,0), which is the last number of layer 22.

The last number of layer k is S(k) + 8k - 1 = 1 + 4(k-1)k + 8k - 1 = 4k² - 4k + 8k = 4k² + 4k = 4k(k+1)

So, for k=22:
Last number = 4*22*23 = 2024

So, (22,0) is 2024.

Now, the neighbors:
1. (23,1): next after 2026, so 2027
2. (23,-1): ?
3. (22,0): 2024
4. (24,0): ?
5. (24,1): ?
6. (24,-1): ?
7. (22,1): ?
8. (22,-1): ?

This seems incomplete. Maybe a better approach is to realize that in the spiral, the numbers increase as we go around, so the neighbors are the numbers that are adjacent in the grid and are part of the spiral.

Given that (23,0) is 2026, the next number is 2027 at (23,1), then 2028 at (23,2), ..., up to (23,23) which is 2026 + 23 = 2049.

Then, the next number is at (22,23), which is 2050, then (21,23), ..., (0,23), (-23,23), then (-23,22), ..., (-23,-23), then (-22,-23), ..., (0,-23), (23,-23), then (23,-22), ..., (23,-1), and ends at (23,0) which is 2026.

So, the sequence is:
- (23,0): 2026
- (23,1): 2027
- ...
- (23,23): 2049
- (22,23): 2050
- ...
- (0,23): 2072
- (-23,23): 2073
- (-23,22): 2074
- ...
- (-23,-23): 2073 + 46 = 2119
- (-22,-23): 2120
- ...
- (0,-23): 2143
- (23,-23): 2144
- (23,-22): 2145
- ...
- (23,-1): 2208
- (23,0): 2209? Wait, no, (23,0) is 2026, which is the start of layer 23.

This seems inconsistent. Maybe the starting number of layer 23 is not 2026.

Wait, earlier we had S(22)=2025, so layer 23 starts at 2026, and ends at 2026 + 8*23 -1 = 2026 + 183 = 2209.

So, the sequence is:
- (23,0): 2026
- (23,1): 2027
- ...
- (23,23): 2026 + 23 = 2049
- (22,23): 2050
- ...
- (0,23): 2026 + 23 + 23 = 2072
- (-23,23): 2073
- (-23,22): 2074
- ...
- (-23,-23): 2073 + 46 = 2119
- (-22,-23): 2120
- ...
- (0,-23): 2143
- (23,-23): 2144
- (23,-22): 2145
- ...
- (23,-1): 2144 + 22 = 2166
- (23,0): 2167? But layer 23 ends at 2209, so this can't be.

I think the mistake is in assuming that (23,0) is the first number in layer 23. Actually, the starting point of layer k is (k,0), and the first number is S(k) = 1 + 4(k-1)k.

For k=23:
S(23) = 1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2024 = 2025, but earlier we had S(22)=2025, so S(23)=2025 + 8*23 = 2025 + 184 = 2209.

Wait, no, the starting number of layer k is 1 + 4(k-1)k.

For k=1: 1 + 0 = 1, but layer 1 starts at 2. So the formula seems off.

Alternative formula: the first number in layer k is the first number after layer k-1, which is 1 + 4(k-1)k + 1 = 4k² - 4k + 2.

For k=1: 4 - 4 + 2 = 2 (correct)
k=2: 16 - 8 + 2 = 10 (correct)
k=3: 36 - 12 + 2 = 26 (correct)

So, starting number of layer 23 is 4*529 - 92 + 2 = 2116 - 92 + 2 = 2026.

So, layer 23 starts at 2026 at (23,0), and ends at 2026 + 8*23 -1 = 2026 + 183 = 2209.

Now, the sequence is:
- (23,0): 2026
- (23,1): 2027
- ...
- (23,23): 2026 + 23 = 2049
- (22,23): 2050
- ...
- (0,23): 2026 + 23 + 23 = 2072
- (-23,23): 2073
- (-23,22): 2074
- ...
- (-23,-23): 2073 + 46 = 2119
- (-22,-23): 2120
- ...
- (0,-23): 2143
- (23,-23): 2144
- (23,-22): 2145
- ...
- (23,-1): 2144 + 22 = 2166
- (23,0): 2167? But layer ends at 2209, so this can't be.

This suggests that the sequence doesn't loop back to (23,0) at the end, but rather the next layer starts at (24,0) for 2209.

Thus, the eight neighbors of (23,0) are:
1. (23,1): 2027
2. (23,-1): ?
3. (22,0): ?
4. (24,0): 2209 (start of next layer)
5. (24,1): ?
6. (24,-1): ?
7. (22,1): ?
8. (22,-1): ?

From the sequence, (23,-1) is not directly assigned in the initial rightward pass, so it's likely part of the downward pass at the end.

The downward pass starts at (-22,-23) and goes up to (23,-23), then right to (23,-22), ..., (23,-1).

So, (23,-1) is the second last number in the downward pass, which is 2209 - 2 = 2207.

Similarly, (23,-2) is 2208, (23,-3) is not part of the spiral's immediate neighbors.

Similarly, (22,0) is the last number of layer 22, which is 4*22*23 = 2024.

(22,1) is the first number after (22,0) in layer 22, which is 2025.

(22,-1) is the second last number in layer 22's downward pass, which is 2024 - 2 = 2022.

(24,0) is 2209.

(24,1) is the first number after 2209 in layer 24, which is 2209 + 1 = 2210.

(24,-1) is the second number in layer 24's downward pass, which is 2209 + 2 = 2211.

Now, let's list all eight neighbors with their numbers:
1. (23,1): 2027
2. (23,-1): 2207
3. (22,0): 2024
4. (24,0): 2209
5. (24,1): 2210
6. (24,-1): 2211
7. (22,1): 2025
8. (22,-1): 2022

Now, sum them up:
2027 + 2207 = 4234
4234 + 2024 = 6258
6258 + 2209 = 8467
8467 + 2210 = 10677
10677 + 2211 = 12888
12888 + 2025 = 14913
14913 + 2022 = 16935

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is **16,935**.
