Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're dealing with a spiral arrangement of natural numbers on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Grid

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. Here's a small example based on the given snippet:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the spiral starts at 1 and moves outward in layers. The center is 1, surrounded by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on.

Let's try to generalize how the numbers are placed in the spiral:

1. **Center**: The number 1 is at the center.
2. **First layer (ring around 1)**: The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 form a square around 1.
   - 2 is to the right of 1.
   - 3 is above 2.
   - 4 is left of 3.
   - 5 is below 4.
   - Then the next layer starts with 6 to the left of 5, and so on.

This seems like a standard Ulam spiral or a square spiral where numbers increase outward in a clockwise manner after each turn.

### Determining the Position of 2026

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the grid. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Layers**: Each complete "ring" or layer around the center can be thought of as a square. The number of numbers in each layer increases as we go outward.
   - Layer 0: Just the center (1).
   - Layer 1: Numbers 2 to 9 (8 numbers).
   - Layer 2: Numbers 10 to 25 (16 numbers).
   - Layer n: The nth layer has (2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 8n numbers.

   Wait, let's calculate the number of numbers in each layer more carefully.

   Actually, the number of numbers in the nth layer is the difference between the squares of the side lengths of consecutive layers.

   - The first layer (n=1) goes from 2 to 9: that's 8 numbers (side length 3, so 3x3 - 1 = 8).
   - The second layer (n=2) goes from 10 to 25: that's 16 numbers (side length 5, so 5x5 - 3x3 = 16).
   - Generally, the nth layer has (2n + 1)^2 - (2n - 1)^2 = 8n numbers.

   So, the number of numbers up to the nth layer is 1 (center) + sum from k=1 to n of 8k = 1 + 8*(n(n+1)/2) = 1 + 4n(n+1).

   We need to find the smallest n such that 1 + 4n(n+1) >= 2026.

   Let's solve 4n(n+1) + 1 >= 2026 => 4n^2 + 4n + 1 >= 2026 => 4n^2 + 4n - 2025 >= 0.

   Divide by 4: n^2 + n - 506.25 >= 0.

   Solving n^2 + n - 506.25 = 0: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2025)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(2026)] / 2.

   sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01, so n ≈ (-1 + 45.01)/2 ≈ 22.005.

   So, n = 22 is the smallest integer where the layer contains 2026.

   Let's check:

   For n=21: 1 + 4*21*22 = 1 + 1848 = 1849.

   For n=22: 1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2024 = 2025.

   So, 2025 numbers are in the first 22 layers, and 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer.

   Wait, no: the first layer is n=1, so 2026 is in layer 22 (since up to layer 21 is 1849, and layer 22 starts at 1850).

   Wait, let's clarify:

   The center is layer 0 (just 1).

   Layer 1: 2 to 9 (8 numbers).

   Layer 2: 10 to 25 (16 numbers).

   ...

   Layer n: starts at 1 + sum from k=1 to n-1 of 8k = 1 + 4(n-1)n.

   So, for layer 22: starts at 1 + 4*21*22 = 1 + 1848 = 1849.

   So, layer 22: 1849 to 1849 + 8*22 - 1 = 1849 to 1849 + 175 = 2024.

   Wait, no: layer n has 8n numbers, so layer 22 has 176 numbers: 1849 to 1849 + 175 = 2024.

   So, 2025 is not in layer 22; layer 22 is 1849 to 2024.

   Then layer 23 starts at 2025.

   So, 2026 is in layer 23.

   Let me correct:

   The first layer is n=1: 2 to 9 (8 numbers).

   So, layer n: starts at 1 + sum from k=1 to n-1 of 8k = 1 + 4(n-1)n.

   For n=23: starts at 1 + 4*22*23 = 1 + 2024 = 2025.

   So, layer 23: 2025 to 2025 + 8*23 - 1 = 2025 to 2025 + 183 = 2208.

   So, 2026 is in layer 23, position 2026 - 2025 + 1 = 2nd number in layer 23.

### Position in the Layer

Now, let's see how numbers are arranged in a layer.

For layer n, the numbers go in a square around the previous layer.

Starting from the top-right corner, moving clockwise:

- Start at the top-right corner: this is the first number of the layer.
- Move left along the top edge.
- Move down the left edge.
- Move right along the bottom edge (except the first corner which is already counted).
- Move up the right edge (except the first corner).

For layer 23, the side length is 2*23 + 1 = 47 (since layer 1 has side 3, layer 2 has side 5, etc.).

But actually, the side length increases by 2 each layer: layer 1 is 3x3, layer 2 is 5x5, etc., so layer n is (2n + 1) x (2n + 1).

But the numbers in layer n are placed in a square ring around the previous layer.

The first number in layer n is at position (n, -n) relative to the center (assuming center is (0,0)).

Then the numbers go left, down, right, up.

For layer 23, the first number is at (23, -23).

Then the next numbers go left: (23, -22), (23, -21), ..., (23, 22).

Then down: (22, 22), (21, 22), ..., (-22, 22).

Then right: (-22, 21), (-22, 20), ..., (-22, -22).

Then up: (-21, -22), (-20, -22), ..., (22, -22).

Now, 2026 is the 2nd number in layer 23, so it's the second in the sequence starting at (23, -23).

So, the sequence is:

1. (23, -23): 2025
2. (23, -22): 2026
3. (23, -21): 2027
...
(23, 22): 2025 + 46 = 2071 (since from -23 to 22 is 46 steps)
Then down:
(22, 22): 2072
(21, 22): 2073
...
(-22, 22): 2072 + 44 = 2116
Then right:
(-22, 21): 2117
...
(-22, -22): 2117 + 43 = 2160
Then up:
(-21, -22): 2161
...
(22, -22): 2161 + 43 = 2204

So, 2026 is at (23, -22).

### Finding Neighbors

Now, the eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:

1. Up: (23, -21)
2. Down: (23, -23)
3. Left: (22, -22)
4. Right: (24, -22)
5. Up-left: (22, -21)
6. Up-right: (24, -21)
7. Down-left: (22, -23)
8. Down-right: (24, -23)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

First, let's find the numbers at these positions in the spiral.

We know that the number at (x, y) can be determined by the spiral's construction.

But since we're dealing with large numbers, it's easier to find the numbers adjacent to 2026 in the sequence.

From the sequence:

- 2025: (23, -23)
- 2026: (23, -22)
- 2027: (23, -21)
- ...
- 2071: (23, 22)
- 2072: (22, 22)
- 2073: (21, 22)
- ...
- 2116: (-22, 22)
- 2117: (-22, 21)
- ...
- 2160: (-22, -22)
- 2161: (-21, -22)
- ...
- 2204: (22, -22)

Now, let's assign:

1. Up: (23, -21) - 2027
2. Down: (23, -23) - 2025
3. Left: (22, -22) - ?
   - (22, -22) is the last number in the previous layer's right-up sequence, which is 2160's neighbor.
   - Actually, (22, -22) is the first number in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner.
   - The bottom-right corner is (-22, -22): 2160.
   - Then up: (-21, -22): 2161
   - ...
   - (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203
   - Wait, no: from (-21, -22) to (22, -22) is 43 steps, so:
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2161 + 43 = 2204
   - So, (22, -22) is 2204.
   - But earlier, (22, -22) is the first in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner, which is 2160 + 1 = 2161? Wait, no, the sequence is:
     - (-22, -22): 2160
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203
   - Wait, from (-21, -22) to (22, -22) is 43 steps, so:
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2161 + 43 = 2204
   - So, (22, -22) is 2204.
   - But earlier, (22, -22) is the first in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner, which is 2160 + 1 = 2161? No, the sequence is:
     - (-22, -22): 2160
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203
   - Wait, the number of steps from (-21, -22) to (22, -22) is 22 - (-21) = 43, so:
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2161 + 42 = 2203
   - So, (22, -22) is 2203.
   - But earlier, (22, -22) is the first in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner, which is 2160 + 1 = 2161? No, the sequence is:
     - (-22, -22): 2160
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203
   - So, (22, -22) is 2203.
   - But this contradicts the earlier assignment where (22, -22) is the first in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner, which is 2160 + 1 = 2161? No, the sequence is:
     - (-22, -22): 2160
     - (-21, -22): 2161
     - ...
     - (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203
   - So, (22, -22) is 2203.

   Hmm, seems I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to note that (22, -22) is the first number in the right-up sequence after the bottom-right corner, which is 2160 + 1 = 2161.

   Wait, no: the bottom-right corner is (-22, -22): 2160.

   Then up: (-21, -22): 2161
   ...
   (22, -22): 2160 + 43 = 2203.

   So, (22, -22) is 2203.

4. Right: (24, -22) - ?
   - (24, -22) is in the next layer's top edge.
   - The next layer starts at 2205.
   - The first number in layer 24 is (24, -24): 2205.
   - Then left: (24, -23): 2206
   - (24, -22): 2207
   - So, (24, -22) is 2207.

5. Up-left: (22, -21) - ?
   - (22, -21) is in the previous layer's right-up sequence.
   - From earlier, (22, -22) is 2203, so (22, -21) is 2204.

6. Up-right: (24, -21) - ?
   - (24, -21) is in the next layer's top edge.
   - (24, -24): 2205
   - (24, -23): 2206
   - (24, -22): 2207
   - (24, -21): 2208

7. Down-left: (22, -23) - ?
   - (22, -23) is in the previous layer's left edge.
   - From earlier, (23, -23) is 2025, (23, -22) is 2026, (23, -21) is 2027, ..., (23, 22) is 2071.
   - Then down: (22, 22) is 2072, ..., (-22, 22) is 2116.
   - Then right: (-22, 21) is 2117, ..., (-22, -22) is 2160.
   - Then up: (-21, -22) is 2161, ..., (22, -22) is 2203.
   - So, (22, -23) is the previous number before (22, -22), which is 2202.

8. Down-right: (24, -23) - ?
   - (24, -23) is in the next layer's top edge.
   - (24, -24): 2205
   - (24, -23): 2206

Now, let's summarize the neighbors:

1. Up: (23, -21) - 2027
2. Down: (23, -23) - 2025
3. Left: (22, -22) - 2203
4. Right: (24, -22) - 2207
5. Up-left: (22, -21) - 2204
6. Up-right: (24, -21) - 2208
7. Down-left: (22, -23) - 2202
8. Down-right: (24, -23) - 2206

Now, let's list all eight neighbors and their numbers:

1. Up: 2027
2. Down: 2025
3. Left: 2203
4. Right: 2207
5. Up-left: 2204
6. Up-right: 2208
7. Down-left: 2202
8. Down-right: 2206

### Calculating the Sum

Now, sum these numbers:

2025 + 2027 + 2202 + 2203 + 2204 + 2206 + 2207 + 2208

Let's add them step by step:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

4052 + 2202 = 6254

6254 + 2203 = 8457

8457 + 2204 = 10661

10661 + 2206 = 12867

12867 + 2207 = 15074

15074 + 2208 = 17282

### Verification

Let me verify the numbers to ensure no mistakes:

- 2025: down
- 2027: up
- 2202: down-left
- 2203: left
- 2204: up-left
- 2206: down-right
- 2207: right
- 2208: up-right

Adding:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2202 + 2203 = 4405

2204 + 2206 = 4410

2207 + 2208 = 4415

Now, 4052 + 4405 = 8457

8457 + 4410 = 12867

12867 + 4415 = 17282

The sum checks out.

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is **17282**.
