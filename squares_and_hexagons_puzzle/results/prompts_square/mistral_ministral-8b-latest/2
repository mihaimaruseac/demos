Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Layout

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. Starting from the center, the numbers increase outward in a square spiral pattern. Here's how the initial part looks:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that:
- The center is `1`.
- Moving right from `1` is `2`, then `3` above `2`, `4` to the left of `3`, `5` below `4`, and so on.

This forms a square spiral where each "layer" around the center increases the size of the square by 2 in each dimension (length and width).

### Identifying the Position of 2026

To find the neighbors of 2026, we first need to determine its position in the grid. To do this, we'll find out which "ring" or "layer" 2026 is in.

Let's define the layers:
- **Layer 0**: Just the center `1`.
- **Layer 1**: The numbers `2` to `9` forming a 3x3 square.
- **Layer 2**: The next numbers forming a 5x5 square, and so on.

The number of numbers in each layer can be calculated as follows:
- Layer 0: 1 number.
- Layer 1: 8 numbers (from 2 to 9).
- Layer 2: 16 numbers (from 10 to 25).
- Generally, Layer n: 8n numbers.

But actually, the count is:
- Layer 0: 1
- Layer 1: 8
- Layer 2: 16
- ...
- Layer k: 8k

But more accurately, the number of numbers up to layer k is 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1).

But let's find a better way to determine the layer of a number.

The smallest number in layer k is:
- Layer 0: 1
- Layer 1: 2
- Layer 2: 10
- Layer 3: 27
- Layer 4: 55
- ...

This sequence can be represented by the formula for the smallest number in layer k:
Smallest number in layer k = 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = 1 + 8*(k-1)k/2 = 1 + 4k(k-1)

Let's verify:
- k=1: 1 + 4*1*0 = 1 (but layer 1 starts at 2, seems off)
Wait, maybe layer numbering starts differently.

Alternative approach:
The number of numbers up to layer k is 1 + 8*(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1)

So, the smallest number in layer k is the first number after layer k-1:
Smallest in layer k = 1 + 4(k-1)k + 1 = 4k(k-1) + 2

Let's check:
k=1: 4*1*0 + 2 = 2 (correct, layer 1 starts at 2)
k=2: 4*2*1 + 2 = 10 (correct)
k=3: 4*3*2 + 2 = 26 (but layer 3 starts at 27, seems off)
Wait, no, layer 3 starts at 27, but 4*3*2 + 2 = 26, so maybe layer numbering is off by 1.

Alternative formula: smallest in layer k is 4k(k-1) + 1
k=1: 0 +1=1 (but layer 1 starts at 2)
No, seems inconsistent.

Better to find k such that 4k(k-1) + 2 <= n < 4(k+1)k + 2

Let's find k for 2026.

Find k where 4k(k-1) + 2 <= 2026 < 4(k+1)k + 2

Let's solve 4k^2 - 4k + 2 <= 2026
4k^2 - 4k - 2024 <= 0
k^2 - k - 506 <= 0

Solve k^2 - k - 506 = 0
k = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 2024)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(2025)] / 2 = [1 ± 45]/2
Positive root: (1 + 45)/2 = 23

So k=23 is the layer where 2026 is.

Check:
For k=23: smallest is 4*23*22 + 2 = 2024 + 2 = 2026
So 2026 is the first number in layer 23.

### Position of 2026 in the Grid

Now, let's determine the coordinates of 2026.

In a square spiral, the position can be determined by the layer and the position within the layer.

Layer 23 starts at 2026, and the layer has 8*23 = 184 numbers (from 2026 to 2026 + 183 = 2209).

The first number in layer k is at position (k, k) if we consider the center as (0,0), but usually, the center is (1,1) in a grid where the spiral starts at 1.

But let's define coordinates based on the initial grid:

Center is 1 at (0,0)
Layer 1:
2 at (0,1)
3 at (-1,1)
4 at (-1,0)
5 at (-1,-1)
6 at (0,-1)
7 at (1,-1)
8 at (1,0)
9 at (1,1)

Layer 2:
Starts at 10 at (2,1)
Then 11 at (2,2)
12 at (1,2)
13 at (0,2)
14 at (-1,2)
15 at (-2,2)
16 at (-2,1)
17 at (-2,0)
18 at (-2,-1)
19 at (-2,-2)
20 at (-1,-2)
21 at (0,-2)
22 at (1,-2)
23 at (2,-2)
24 at (2,-1)
25 at (2,0)

From this, we can see that for layer k, the numbers are arranged in a square with side length 2k+1, starting from (k, k) and going right, up, left, down, etc.

But 2026 is the first number in layer 23, so it's at (23, 23).

### Finding Neighbors of 2026

Now, the eight neighbors of a number in the spiral are the numbers directly above, below, left, right, and the four diagonals.

Given that 2026 is at (23, 23), its neighbors are at:
- (23, 24)
- (23, 22)
- (22, 23)
- (24, 23)
- (22, 22)
- (22, 24)
- (24, 22)
- (24, 24)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

### Determining Numbers at Neighboring Positions

This is where it gets tricky. We need a general formula to find the number at any position (x, y) in the spiral.

From the initial layers, we can observe that the spiral moves in layers where each layer is a square with side length increasing by 2.

The number at position (x, y) can be determined by:
1. Find the layer k where the maximum of |x| and |y| is k.
2. Determine the position within the layer.

But since 2026 is at (23,23), all its neighbors are at positions where at least one coordinate is 23 or 24.

Let's find the numbers at these positions.

#### General Approach:

For a position (x, y), the number can be found by:
1. Let k = max(|x|, |y|).
2. The number is in layer k.
3. The starting number of layer k is 4k(k-1) + 2 (as earlier).
4. The position within the layer can be determined by the direction from the starting point.

But since 2026 is at (23,23), and it's the first in layer 23, the next numbers go right, up, left, down, etc.

So:
- (23, 24): right from (23,23) is the second in layer 23: 2027
- (23, 22): left from (23,23) is the last in the top row: ?
Wait, no, the order is right, up, left, down.

Layer 23 starts at (23,23) = 2026
Then right: (23,24) = 2027
Then up: (22,24) = 2028
Then left: (22,23) = 2029
Then down: (22,22) = 2030
Then left: (22,21) = 2031
Then down: (23,21) = 2032
Then left: (24,21) = 2033
Then down: (24,22) = 2034
Then right: (24,23) = 2035
Then up: (24,24) = 2036
Then right: (25,24) = 2037
And so on.

But we need the immediate neighbors, which are the four cardinal and four diagonal adjacent positions.

From (23,23) = 2026:
- Right: (23,24) = 2027
- Left: (23,22) = ?
- Up: (22,23) = ?
- Down: (24,23) = ?

But in the spiral, after (23,23), the next is (23,24), then (22,24), etc., so (23,22) is not adjacent in the spiral order, but in the grid, it's adjacent.

Wait, the neighbors in the grid are all eight surrounding cells, regardless of the spiral order.

So we need to find the numbers at:
(23,24), (23,22), (22,23), (24,23), (22,22), (22,24), (24,22), (24,24)

From the spiral order, we have:
(23,23) = 2026
(23,24) = 2027
(22,24) = 2028
(22,23) = 2029
(22,22) = 2030
(23,21) = 2031
(24,21) = 2032
(24,22) = 2033
(24,23) = 2034
(24,24) = 2035

But we need (23,22), which is not directly in the sequence above. It seems (23,22) is not part of the immediate next numbers in the spiral order, but in the grid, it's adjacent.

This suggests that the immediate grid neighbors are not all consecutive in the spiral order, but we can find their numbers by determining their positions.

#### Finding Number at (23,22):

This is to the left of (23,23). In the spiral, after (23,23), the next is (23,24), then (22,24), etc., so (23,22) is not adjacent in the spiral order, but in the grid, it's adjacent.

This implies that the number at (23,22) is not immediately next in the spiral sequence, but we can find it by considering that the spiral moves right, then up, then left, etc., so (23,22) is not part of the immediate next numbers.

This suggests that the immediate grid neighbors are not all present in the spiral's immediate sequence, but we can find their numbers by determining their positions.

Alternatively, we can find the number at (x,y) by:

The number at (x,y) is:
- If x + y is even: (x + y)^2 / 4 + x
- If x + y is odd: (x + y + 1)^2 / 4 - (x + 1)

But let's test with known points:
(0,0): 1 + 0 = 1 (correct)
(1,0): (1+0+1)^2 /4 - (1+1) = 4/4 -2 = -1 (incorrect)
(0,1): (0+1+1)^2 /4 - (0+1) = 4/4 -1 = 0 (incorrect)

This formula seems incorrect.

Alternative formula:
For (x,y), the number is:
- If x >= 0 and y >= 0 and x + y is even: (x + y)^2 / 4 + x
- If x >= 0 and y >= 0 and x + y is odd: (x + y + 1)^2 / 4 - y
- And similarly for other quadrants.

Let's try:
(0,0): even, 0 + 0 = 1 (correct)
(1,0): odd, (1+1+1)^2 /4 -0 = 9/4 -0 = 2.25 (not integer, incorrect)
(0,1): odd, (0+1+1)^2 /4 -1 = 9/4 -1 = 1.25 (incorrect)

This seems problematic.

Another approach: the number at (x,y) is the same as at (y,x), and can be found by:

Let s = x + y
Let d = |x - y|
Then number = (s + 1)^2 / 4 - d

Check:
(0,0): s=0, d=0: (1)^2 /4 -0 = 0.25 (incorrect)
(1,0): s=1, d=1: (2)^2 /4 -1 = 4/4 -1 = 0 (incorrect)

Not working.

Alternative idea: the number at (x,y) is the same as the number at (y,x), and can be found by:

For x >= 0, y >= 0:
If x >= y:
   number = x^2 - x + y + 1
Else:
   number = y^2 - y + x + 1

Check:
(0,0): 0 -0 +0 +1 =1 (correct)
(1,0): 1 -1 +0 +1 =1 (but should be 2)
(0,1): 1 -1 +0 +1 =1 (but should be 2)
Not matching.

This seems complex. Maybe a better approach is to note that the immediate grid neighbors are not all consecutive in the spiral order, but we can find their numbers by considering that the spiral moves in layers, and the numbers at adjacent positions can be determined by their positions relative to the center.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to find the numbers at the eight positions by observing the pattern:

From the initial layers, the numbers at positions adjacent to the starting point of a layer can be determined by the sequence.

Given that 2026 is at (23,23), and the next numbers go right, up, left, down, etc., the immediate grid neighbors are:

(23,24): next in spiral after (23,23) is (23,24) = 2027
(22,24): next is (22,24) = 2028
(22,23): next is (22,23) = 2029
(22,22): next is (22,22) = 2030
(23,22): this is not in the immediate next numbers, but in the grid, it's adjacent. It's the number before (23,23) in the spiral order, which is 2025.

Similarly:
(24,23): this is the number after completing the top and left sides, which is 2034
(24,24): next is (24,24) = 2035
(24,22): this is the number after (24,21), which is 2033
(23,22): as above, 2025

Wait, let's list all eight:

1. (23,24): 2027
2. (23,22): ?
3. (22,23): 2029
4. (24,23): 2034
5. (22,22): 2030
6. (22,24): 2028
7. (24,22): 2033
8. (24,24): 2035

Now, (23,22): this is to the left of (23,23). In the spiral, the number before (23,23) is (23,22), which is part of the previous layer's bottom row. The number at (23,22) is the same as at (22,23) in the previous layer, but adjusted.

Actually, the number at (23,22) is the same as the number at (22,23) in the previous layer, but since (23,23) is the first in layer 23, (23,22) is the last in the bottom row of layer 22.

The last number in layer k is 4k(k-1) + 2 + 8k -1 = 4k^2 -4k +2 +8k -1 = 4k^2 +4k +1

For k=22: 4*22*22 +4*22 +1 = 1936 +88 +1 = 2025

So (23,22) = 2025

Similarly, (24,22): this is the number after (23,22) in the spiral order, which is 2026, but that's not correct because (24,22) is not adjacent to (23,22) in the spiral order.

Wait, no, (24,22) is part of the next layer's left side.

Actually, the number at (24,22) is the same as the number at (22,24) in the previous layer, but adjusted.

This seems complex. Maybe a better approach is to note that the immediate grid neighbors are:

(23,24): 2027
(23,22): 2025
(22,23): 2029
(24,23): 2034
(22,22): 2030
(22,24): 2028
(24,22): 2033
(24,24): 2035

Now, let's verify some:

(23,22) is the number before (23,23), which is 2025 (as calculated)
(24,22) is the number after completing the top and left sides, which is 2033 (from earlier)
(22,22) is 2030 (from earlier)
(22,24) is 2028
(24,24) is 2035

Now, let's check if these make sense in the spiral order:

After (23,23)=2026:
(23,24)=2027
(22,24)=2028
(22,23)=2029
(22,22)=2030
(23,22)=2025 (this is before 2026, which contradicts the order)

This suggests that (23,22) is not the immediate previous, but perhaps it's part of the previous layer's bottom row.

Given the complexity, perhaps the correct neighbors are:

From the initial layers, the immediate grid neighbors are:

For (23,23)=2026:
- Right: (23,24)=2027
- Left: (23,22)=2025
- Up: (22,23)=2029
- Down: (24,23)=2034
- Diagonals:
  - Up-right: (22,24)=2028
  - Up-left: (22,22)=2030
  - Down-right: (24,24)=2035
  - Down-left: (24,22)=2033

Now, let's sum these:
2027 + 2025 + 2029 + 2034 + 2028 + 2030 + 2035 + 2033

Calculating step by step:
2027 + 2025 = 4052
4052 + 2029 = 6081
6081 + 2034 = 8115
8115 + 2028 = 10143
10143 + 2030 = 12173
12173 + 2035 = 14208
14208 + 2033 = 16241

### Final Answer

The sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026 is **16,241**.
