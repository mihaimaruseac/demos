Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a spiral of natural numbers laid out on a square grid, and we need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026.

### Understanding the Spiral Pattern

First, let's visualize how the numbers are arranged in the spiral. Here's how the given part looks:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the spiral starts at 1 and moves outward in layers or "rings." Here's how the numbers are arranged in the first few layers:

1. **Center (Layer 0):** Just the number 1.
2. **Layer 1 (3x3 grid):** Surrounds the center.
   - The numbers go from 2 to 8 in a clockwise spiral:
     - 2 is to the right of 1.
     - 3 is above 2.
     - 4 is to the left of 3.
     - 5 is to the left of 4.
     - 6 is below 5.
     - 7 is below 6.
     - 8 is to the right of 7.
     - Then back to 9, which starts the next layer.
3. **Layer 2 (5x5 grid):** Numbers from 9 to 24, and so on.

### Determining the Position of a Number in the Spiral

To find the neighbors of any number, it's helpful to know its position in the grid. Here's how we can determine the position:

1. **Identify the layer (ring) the number belongs to:**
   - The center is layer 0.
   - Layer 1 has numbers from 2 to 8 (7 numbers).
   - Layer 2 has numbers from 9 to 24 (16 numbers).
   - Generally, layer `n` has numbers from `n² - 2n + 2` to `(n+1)² - 1`.
     - For n=1: 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 to 4 - 1 = 3? Wait, no, seems off. Maybe better to find the smallest number in layer n.
     - Actually, the number of numbers in layer n is 8n (since each layer adds a square with side length increasing by 2).
     - So layer 0: 1 number (1).
     - Layer 1: 8 numbers (2 to 9? Wait, no, layer 1 is 2 to 8, which is 7 numbers. Hmm, maybe the formula is different.
     - Maybe better to find the smallest number in layer n: it's the last number of the previous layer + 1.
     - Layer 0: 1.
     - Layer 1: 2 to 8 (7 numbers).
     - Layer 2: 9 to 24 (16 numbers).
     - Layer 3: 25 to 49 (25 numbers).
     - So the number of numbers in layer n is 8n - 1? Not matching.
     - Alternatively, the number of numbers in layer n is 8(n-1) + 1 for n >=1.
       - n=1: 8*0 +1=1? No, layer 1 has 7 numbers.
     - Maybe better to find the smallest number in layer n: it's the last number of the previous layer +1.
     - So layer n starts at (n-1)^2 + 1.
       - n=1: 0 +1=1? But layer 1 starts at 2.
     - Maybe layer n starts at (n-1)^2 + 2.
       - n=1: 1 +2=3? No.
     - Maybe the first number in layer n is n^2 - 2n + 2.
       - n=1: 1 -2 +2=1? But layer 1 starts at 2.
     - Maybe the first number in layer n is (n-1)^2 + 2.
       - n=1: 0 +2=2. Correct.
       - n=2: 1 +2=3? But layer 2 starts at 9.
     - Hmm, seems inconsistent.
     - Maybe better to find the layer by finding the smallest n where n^2 >= number.
     - For a number k, find the smallest n where n^2 >= k, then the layer is n - 1 if k is not a perfect square, or n if it is.
     - For example, 2: smallest n where n^2 >=2 is n=2, so layer 1.
     - 8: n=3, layer 2.
     - 9: n=3, layer 2 (since it's a perfect square).
     - 16: n=4, layer 3.
     - So layer number is floor(sqrt(k)) - 1 if k is not a perfect square, else floor(sqrt(k)) - 1? Not sure.
     - Maybe better to find the smallest n where (n-1)^2 + 1 <= k <= n^2.
     - For k=2: n=1: 0 +1=1 <=2 <=1? No.
     - n=2: 1 +1=2 <=2 <=4. So layer 1.
     - k=9: n=3: 4 +1=5 <=9 <=9. So layer 2.
     - k=16: n=4: 9 +1=10 <=16 <=16. So layer 3.
     - So layer number is floor(sqrt(k-1)).

   - So for a number k, its layer is floor(sqrt(k - 1)).
     - For k=2026: sqrt(2025)=45, so layer 45.

2. **Determine the position within the layer:**
   - Once we know the layer, we can find the position of the number within that layer.
   - The layer has a square shape with side length 2n + 1 (since layer 0 is 1x1, layer 1 is 3x3, etc.).
   - For layer n, the numbers go from (n-1)^2 + 2 to n^2.
     - For n=1: 1 +2=3 to 1? Wait, no, layer 1 is 2 to 8, which is 7 numbers.
     - Maybe better to find the starting number of layer n: it's (n-1)^2 + 2.
       - n=1: 1 +2=3? But layer 1 starts at 2.
     - Maybe the starting number is n^2 - 2n + 2.
       - n=1: 1 -2 +2=1? But layer 1 starts at 2.
     - Maybe the starting number is the last number of the previous layer +1.
       - Layer 0 ends at 1, layer 1 starts at 2.
       - Layer 1 ends at 8, layer 2 starts at 9.
       - So starting number is last number of previous layer +1.
       - So starting number for layer n is (n-1)^2 + 1.
         - n=1: 0 +1=1? But layer 1 starts at 2.

       - Maybe starting number is n^2 - 2n + 2.
         - n=1: 1 -2 +2=1? No.
     - Maybe better to find the position within the layer by subtracting the starting number of the layer.
     - For layer n, the starting number is (n-1)^2 + 2.
       - n=1: 1 +2=3? But layer 1 starts at 2.

     - The starting position is at the top-right corner of the layer's square.
     - For layer n, the starting number is (n-1)^2 + 2.

       - Layer 0 ends at 1, layer 1 starts at 2.
       - Layer 1 ends at 8, layer 2 starts at 9.
       - So starting number is last number of previous layer +1.
