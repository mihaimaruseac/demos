Let's break this down step-by-step.

---

## 1. Understanding the spiral pattern

The spiral starts at the center with 1, then goes right, up, left, down, etc.

Positions relative to center (x, y) with 1 at (0,0):

- 1 at (0,0)
- 2 at (1,0)
- 3 at (1,1)
- 4 at (0,1)
- 5 at (-1,1)
- 6 at (-1,0)
- 7 at (-1,-1)
- 8 at (0,-1)
- 9 at (1,-1)
- 10 at (2,-1)
- 11 at (2,0)
- 12 at (2,1)
- 13 at (2,2)
- 14 at (1,2)
- 15 at (0,2)
- 16 at (-1,2)
- 17 at (-2,2)
- 18 at (-2,1)
- 19 at (-2,0)
- 20 at (-2,-1)
- 21 at (-2,-2)
- 22 at (-1,-2)
- 23 at (0,-2)
- 24 at (1,-2)
- 25 at (2,-2)
- etc.

## 2. Find coordinates of 2026

We can find which "ring" 2026 is in.

Ring k: numbers from \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2k+1)^2\), centered at origin.

Let’s check:

Ring 1: 2 to 9 → (2*1-1)^2 = 1, so from 2 to (3)^2=9 → size 8 numbers.
Ring 2: 10 to 25 → (3)^2=9, so from 10 to (5)^2=25.
Ring 3: 26 to 49 → (5)^2=25, so from 26 to (7)^2=49.
Ring k: start = \((2k-1)^2 + 1\), end = \((2k+1)^2\).

We can solve for k for 2026:

Let \((2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2\).

Test k=22: (2k-1)^2 = 43^2 = 1849, (2k+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.
Ring 22: numbers 1850 to 2025.

So 2025 is the last number of ring 22.

Thus 2026 is the first number of ring 23.

---

## 3. Coordinates for first number of ring k

Ring k starts at number \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) at position \((k, 1-k)\)? Let's check pattern:

Ring 1 start 2 at (1,0) → k=1: (1,0) = (k, 0) but 1-k=0 yes.
Ring 2 start 10 at (2,-1) → k=2: (2,-1) = (k, -k+1)?? Let's check: -k+1=-1 yes.
Ring 3 start 26 at (3,-2) → k=3: (3,-2) = (k, -k+1)? -3+1=-2 yes.

So formula: Start of ring k: coordinates \((k, 1-k)\).

---

For k=23: start number = \((2k-1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\).

Coordinates: (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

So 2026 is at (23, -22).

---

## 4. Movement along the ring

Ring k has side length 2k (number of steps along one side before turning).

The path: start at (k, 1-k), go left to (-k, 1-k), then down to (-k, -k+1-2k+1?) Wait, let's be systematic:

Actually, let's recall: In the spiral, after the start (rightmost bottom side? Let's check small k):

Better: Let's trace ring k=2: start (2,-1), then go left to (-2,-1), then up to (-2,2), then right to (2,2), then down to (2,-2) but stop before reaching start-1? Actually start is top-right? Let's check known spiral coords:

From known: 1 at (0,0), ring 1: 2(1,0),3(1,1),4(0,1),5(-1,1),6(-1,0),7(-1,-1),8(0,-1),9(1,-1).

So indeed: ring 1: start east side (1,0), go north side (1,1), west side (0,1),(-1,1), south side (-1,0),(-1,-1), east side (0,-1),(1,-1).

Ring 2 start 10 at (2,-1) — actually that's bottom-right corner? Let's check path: 10(2,-1), 11(2,0),12(2,1),13(2,2),14(1,2),15(0,2),16(-1,2),17(-2,2),18(-2,1),19(-2,0),20(-2,-1),21(-2,-2),22(-1,-2),23(0,-2),24(1,-2),25(2,-2).

So pattern: ring k starts at (k, -k+1)? Wait check: k=2: (2,-1) = (k, -k+1)? -2+1=-1 yes. k=3: start 26 at (3,-2) yes.

So start = (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k).

Direction sequence for ring k: Start facing north? Actually at start (k,1-k), then move: up to (k, k)? Let's see k=2: (2,-1) → up to (2,2) via (2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Yes.

So: side1: Up: from (k,1-k) to (k,k) — length = 2k-1 steps? Wait count: from y=1-k to y=k: dy = k - (1-k) = 2k-1? Let's check k=2: from y=-1 to y=2: difference 3 = 2*2-1=3 yes.

Side2: Left: from (k,k) to (-k,k): length=2k.

Side3: Down: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k): length=2k.

Side4: Right: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k): length=2k.

But last side doesn't complete to start, it stops before start? Actually side4: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k) but start is at (k,1-k) which is above (k,-k). So side4 goes to (k,-k) then we'd need to go up to start y=1-k, but that's beginning of next ring? Actually no — the last side is shorter? Let's check k=2: side4: from (-2,-2) to (2,-2): points: 21(-2,-2),22(-1,-2),23(0,-2),24(1,-2),25(2,-2). Then next ring starts at 26(3,-2). So indeed side4 length=2k? Actually from x=-k to x=k: 2k steps? Count: -2,-1,0,1,2 → 5 points = 2k+1? Wait: -k to k inclusive: 2k+1 points. But number count: side1: 2k numbers? Let's check k=2: side1: 10,11,12,13 → 4 numbers = 2k. Yes.

So: side1: up: length=2k numbers, coordinates: start (k,1-k) to (k,k): y from 1-k to k: 2k numbers.

Side2: left: from (k,k) to (-k,k): length=2k numbers.

Side3: down: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k): length=2k numbers.

Side4: right: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k): length=2k numbers.

Total numbers in ring k: 8k.

---

## 5. Locate 2026 in ring k=23

Start of ring 23: number 2026 at (23, -22).

Side1: up direction: increase y from -22 to 23 (since k=23, y goes to 23).

Numbers: 2026 at (23,-22), 2027 at (23,-21), ..., up to y=23.

Length of side1 = 2k = 46 numbers.

So last number of side1: 2026 + 45 = 2071 at (23,23).

Side2: left: from (23,23) to (-23,23): length=46 numbers: 2072 to 2117.

Side3: down: from (-23,23) to (-23,-23): length=46 numbers: 2118 to 2163.

Side4: right: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23): length=46 numbers: 2164 to 2209.

---

So 2026 is first number of ring ⇒ it's the first number of side1 ⇒ coordinates (23,-22).

---

## 6. Neighbors of (23,-22)

8 neighbors:  
(22,-22), (24,-22),  
(23,-21), (23,-23),  
(22,-21), (24,-21),  
(22,-23), (24,-23).

---

## 7. Which numbers are these?

We know 2026 is at (23,-22). Let's find positions relative to spiral order.

We can find numbers by reasoning about ring boundaries:

- (22,-22): That's inside ring k=22? Let's check: ring k contains all points with max(|x|,|y|)=k. For (22,-22), max(22,22)=22 ⇒ ring 22. Also (22,-22) is the last point of side4 of ring22? Let's check: ring22 start: (22,-21) [since start (k,1-k) = (22,-21)]. Wait, our earlier formula: start of ring k: (k,1-k). For k=22: (22,-21). Yes.

So ring22: start 1850 at (22,-21). Side1: up to (22,22): numbers 1850 to 1895. Side2: left to (-22,22): 1896 to 1941. Side3: down to (-22,-22): 1942 to 1987. Side4: right to (22,-22): 1988 to 2033? Wait, but 2026 is in ring23, so something's wrong — contradiction.

Let's check: If ring22 start 1850 at (22,-21), side1: up to (22,22): length 43 numbers? Wait length side1=2k=44 numbers: from y=-21 to y=22: 44 numbers: 1850..1893. Then side2: left to (-22,22): 1894..1937. Side3: down to (-22,-22): 1938..1981. Side4: right to (22,-22): 1982..2025.

Yes! That fits: 2025 is at (22,-22)! So indeed (22,-22) is end of ring22 ⇒ number 2025.

So neighbor (22,-22) = 2025.

---

Similarly:

(24,-22): max(24,22)=24 ⇒ ring24? But ring24 starts at (24,-23) with number >2026. Actually 2026 is in ring23, so (24,-22) is in ring23 side1? Wait, ring23 side1: from (23,-22) to (23,23). So (24,-22) is outside ring23 ⇒ must be ring24? But ring24 numbers are much larger. Actually (24,-22): max(24,22)=24 ⇒ ring24, so its number is far ahead. We can find it but maybe easier: We just need the 8 neighbors sum.

---

Better approach: The 8 neighbors of the first number of a ring are:

- One is the last number of previous ring (at (k-1, -(k-1)) = (22,-22) = 2025).
- Others: next number in same ring (2027) and others along the geometry.

But maybe easier: The first number of ring k is at (k,1-k). Its neighbors:

1. (k-1,1-k) — inside previous ring? Actually that's the number before start? Let's check k=2: start10 at (2,-1), neighbor (1,-1) is 9 (last of ring1). Yes.

So (22,-22) we found = 2025.

2. (k+1,1-k) — in next ring? Actually no, that's far ahead: (24,-22) is in ring24, much larger.

3. (k,2-k) — above: (23,-21) ⇒ This is the next number in ring23: 2027.

4. (k,-k) — below: (23,-23) ⇒ That's the position just before start of ring24? Actually ring23 side4 ends at (23,-23) with number start_ring24 - 1? Let's find: ring23 side4: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23): last number = start24 - 1 = (2*23+1)^2 = 47^2=2209. So (23,-23) = 2209.

5. (k-1,2-k) — (22,-21) ⇒ That's the start of ring22: 1850.

6. (k+1,2-k) — (24,-21) ⇒ ring24.

7. (k-1,-k) — (22,-23) ⇒ ring22 side4? Actually (22,-23) max(22,23)=23 ⇒ ring23? Wait max(22,23)=23 ⇒ ring23. Specifically side4 of ring23: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23): list positions: x from -23 to 23, y=-23. (22,-23) is near end: number = 2209 - (23-22) = 2208.

8. (k+1,-k) — (24,-23) ⇒ ring24 start minus 1? Actually ring24 start at (24,-23) = 2209+1=2210, so (24,-23) is before that? Wait, ring23 ends at (23,-23)=2209, ring24 starts at (24,-23)=2210. So (24,-23)=2210.

---

So neighbors:

- 2025 (previous ring end)
- 2027 (next in ring)
- 1850 (start of ring22)
- 2209 (end of ring23)
- 2208 (before end of ring23)
- 2210 (start of ring24)
- (24,-22): ring24 number: after start24: start24=2210 at (24,-23), moving up: (24,-22)=2211.
- (24,-21): next: 2212.

---

Check: 8 neighbors:  
(22,-22)=2025  
(24,-22)=2211  
(23,-21)=2027  
(23,-23)=2209  
(22,-21)=1850  
(24,-21)=2212  
(22,-23)=2208  
(24,-23)=2210.

---

## 8. Sum

Sum = 2025 + 2211 + 2027 + 2209 + 1850 + 2212 + 2208 + 2210.

Group: (2025+2027)=4052.  
(2211+2209)=4420.  
(1850+2212)=4062.  
(2208+2210)=4418.

Now: 4052+4420=8472.  
4062+4418=8480.  
8472+8480=16952.

---

\[
\boxed{16952}
\]

---

**Final answer:** The sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is **16952**.
