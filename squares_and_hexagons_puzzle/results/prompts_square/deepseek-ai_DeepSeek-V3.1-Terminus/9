Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

---

## 1. Understanding the spiral

The spiral given is:

```
...  5   4   3  ...
...  6   1   2  ...
...  7   8   9  ...
```

So the center is 1, and it goes:

- Start at 1, right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4, left to 5, down to 6, down to 7, right to 8, right to 9, etc.

This is essentially the same as the standard Ulam spiral starting at 1 in the center, moving right first.

Let's reconstruct the spiral layout around 1:

**Layer 1** (numbers 1 to 1): just 1 at (0,0).

**Layer 2** (numbers 2 to 9):

Positions:

- Start at 1 at (0,0).
- Move right to 2 at (1,0).
- Move up to 3 at (1,1).
- Move left to 4 at (0,1).
- Move left to 5 at (-1,1).
- Move down to 6 at (-1,0).
- Move down to 7 at (-1,-1).
- Move right to 8 at (0,-1).
- Move right to 9 at (1,-1).

So coordinates:

```
(-1,1)  5
(0,1)   4
(1,1)   3
(1,0)   2
(1,-1)  9
(0,-1)  8
(-1,-1) 7
(-1,0)  6
(0,0)   1
```

That matches the given snippet.

## 2. General layer structure

The spiral is built in "rings" or layers:

- Layer k (k ≥ 1) contains numbers from \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2k+1)^2\), but actually let's index layers:

Actually, better:  
Layer 0: just 1.  
Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (3x3 square centered at origin).  
Layer 2: numbers 10 to 25 (5x5 square).  
Layer n: numbers from \((2n-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2n+1)^2\), with side length \(2n+1\).

Wait, check:  
n=1: side length 3, numbers 2 to 9 (since 1 is in layer 0). Yes.

So:  
Layer n has first number = \((2n-1)^2 + 1\), last number = \((2n+1)^2\).

---

## 3. Which layer is 2026 in?

We find n such that:  
\((2n-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2n+1)^2\).

Test n:

n=22: (2n-1)=43, \(43^2=1849\), (2n+1)=45, \(45^2=2025\).  
So layer n=22: numbers 1849+1=1850 to 2025. Wait, 2025 is last number of layer 22? Check:  
Layer 22: first=1849+1=1850, last=2025. Yes.

So 2025 is at (22,22) maybe? Wait, but 2026 would be in layer 23.

Check:  
n=23: (2n-1)=45, \(45^2=2025\), so first number of layer 23 = 2025+1=2026, last number = (2n+1)^2 = 47^2=2209.

Yes! So 2026 is the first number of layer 23.

---

## 4. Coordinates of first number of a layer

Pattern: first number of layer n is at coordinate \((n, 1-n)\)? Let's check small n.

Layer 1 (n=1): first number 2 at (1,0)? Wait, our earlier coordinates:  
Layer 1: start after 1 at (0,0), move right to 2 at (1,0). Yes.

Layer 2 (n=2): first number 10 after \(9=3^2\) at (2,-1)? Let's check:

We had 9 at (1,-1). Then next step: from 9, move up to 10 at (1,0)? Wait, that's wrong — let's map carefully:

Actually let's reconstruct layer 2 (n=2):

From 9 at (1,-1), we go up to (1,0) for 10? No — standard algorithm: after completing layer n=1 (up to 9), we start layer n=2 by moving right from 9? Wait, let's check known rules:

Known Ulam spiral rule:  
Numbers: 1 at (0,0).  
Right 1 step to 2, up 1 step to 3, left 2 steps to 5, down 2 steps to 7, right 2 steps to 9.  
Then right 1 step to 10? No — actually: after 9 at (1,-1), next: up 3 steps? Wait, known: directions cycle: right, up, left, down, but step length increases every two directions.

Better: known: step sizes: 1 right, 1 up, 2 left, 2 down, 3 right, 3 up, 4 left, 4 down, etc.

So:  
1 at (0,0).  
Step size 1: right to 2 at (1,0).  
Step size 1: up to 3 at (1,1).  
Step size 2: left to 4 at (-1,1), left to 5 at (-1,1)? Wait, correction:

Actually:  
Start 0: 1 at (0,0).  
Step length 1: right: 2 at (1,0).  
Step length 1: up: 3 at (1,1).  
Step length 2: left: 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1).  
Step length 2: down: 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1).  
Step length 3: right: 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1), 10 at (2,-1).  
Step length 3: up: 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2).  
Step length 4: left: 14 at (1,2), 15 at (0,2), 16 at (-1,2), 17 at (-2,2).  
Step length 4: down: 18 at (-2,1), 19 at (-2,0), 20 at (-2,-1), 21 at (-2,-2).  
Step length 5: right: 22 at (-1,-2), 23 at (0,-2), 24 at (1,-2), 25 at (2,-2), 26 at (3,-2).  
etc.

So first number of layer n is at (n, 1-n) for n≥1? Check n=1: (1,0) yes for 2.  
n=2: first number of layer 2 is 10 at (2,-1)? From above: 10 at (2,-1) yes.  
n=3: first number of layer 3: after 25=5^2 at (2,-2), next step length 5 right: 26 at (3,-2). That’s (n,1-n)? n=3: (3,-2) yes.

So formula: first number of layer n is at (n, 1-n).

---

## 5. Coordinates of 2026

Layer n=23: first number 2026 at (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

---

## 6. Neighbors of 2026

Neighbors: all 8 adjacent grid points:

(23,-22)'s neighbors:

(22,-22), (24,-22),  
(23,-21), (23,-23),  
(22,-21), (24,-21),  
(22,-23), (24,-23).

---

## 7. Which numbers are at these positions in the spiral?

We can use the fact that the spiral is predictable:  
The first number of layer 23 is at the rightmost column of the top row of that layer? Wait, check orientation: first number of layer n is at the rightmost bottom corner? Actually: (n,1-n) is bottom-right? Let's check n=1: (1,0) is to the right of center, yes. n=2: (2,-1) is right and down from center.

Actually, easier: We can find coordinates-to-number mapping.

Known closed-form for Ulam spiral (starting at 1, right first):

Let \( m = \max(|x|,|y|) \) (the layer index).  
If \( m=0 \), number=1.

Otherwise, find where you are on the m-th layer.

The last number of layer m-1 is \((2m-1)^2\).  
Layer m starts at \((2m-1)^2+1\) at position (m, 1-m).

Then we traverse:  
1. Rightward from (m,1-m) to (m,-m+1)? Wait, let's test m=2: start (2,-1), go up to (2,0),(2,1),(2,2)? No — known algorithm:  
From start (m,1-m), we go up (2m-1) steps? Actually known:  
Path: start at (m,1-m), go up to (m,m) [2m-1 steps?], then left to (-m,m) [2m steps], then down to (-m,-m) [2m steps], then right to (m,-m) [2m steps], but stop before reaching start.

Better: known formula: Let \( m=\max(|x|,|y|) \).  
If y = -m: you're on bottom row: number = (2m+1)^2 - (m+x).  
If x = -m: left col: number = (2m+1)^2 - 3m + y.  
If y = m: top row: number = (2m+1)^2 - 5m - x.  
If x = m: right col: number = (2m+1)^2 - 7m + y.

Check m=1:  
Bottom row y=-1: formula: 9 - (1+x). x from -1 to 1:  
x=-1: 9-(1-1)=9-0=9? Wait, bottom row: y=-1, x from -1 to 1: numbers: 9 at (1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 7 at (-1,-1). Let's test: x=1: 9-(1+1)=9-2=7? That gives 7 at (1,-1)? That’s wrong — oh, formula might be: number = (2m+1)^2 - (m+x) for y=-m:  
m=1: (3^2=9) - (1+x).  
x=1: 9-(1+1)=7 (at (1,-1)) — but we want 9 at (1,-1). So maybe m-x? Let's check known correct one:

Actually known correct:  
If y = -m: number = (2m+1)^2 - (m - x) ? Let's test: m=1, y=-1:  
x=1: 9 - (1-1)=9-0=9 yes.  
x=0: 9-(1-0)=8 yes.  
x=-1: 9-(1-(-1))=9-2=7 yes. Good.

If x = -m: number = (2m+1)^2 - 3m + y. m=1: x=-1:  
y=1: 9-3+1=7? That’s wrong — should be 4 at (-1,1). So maybe -y? Let's check known: Actually known formula:  
x=-m: number = (2m+1)^2 - 3m - y. Test m=1: x=-1:  
y=1: 9-3-1=5 (at (-1,1)) but should be 5? Wait our spiral: (-1,1) is 5 yes. y=0: 9-3-0=6 yes. y=-1: 9-3-(-1)=9-3+1=7 yes. Good.

If y = m: number = (2m+1)^2 - 5m - x. m=1: y=1:  
x=1: 9-5-1=3 yes. x=0: 9-5-0=4 yes. x=-1: 9-5-(-1)=9-5+1=5 but (-1,1) is 5 yes.

If x = m: number = (2m+1)^2 - 7m + y. m=1: x=1:  
y=1: 9-7+1=3? That’s wrong — (1,1) is 3 yes. Wait but that overlaps with y=m case. Actually x=m and y=m is corner, both formulas should match.

So formulas are correct.

## 8. Apply to our 8 neighbors of (23,-22):

m = max(|x|,|y|) for each neighbor.

We know 2026 is at (23,-22), so m=23.

Neighbors:

1. (22,-22): max(22,22)=22. y=-22=-m: bottom row of m=22: number = (2*22+1)^2 - (22 - x) = 45^2 - (22 - 22) = 2025 - 0 = 2025.

2. (24,-22): max(24,22)=24. y=-22 ≠ -24, so not bottom row. x=24=m: right col formula: number = (2*24+1)^2 - 7*24 + y = 49^2 - 168 + (-22) = 2401 - 168 - 22 = 2401 - 190 = 2211.

3. (23,-21): max(23,21)=23. x=23=m: right col: number = (47^2) - 7*23 + (-21) = 2209 - 161 - 21 = 2209 - 182 = 2027.

4. (23,-23): max(23,23)=23. y=-23=-m: bottom row: number = 2209 - (23 - 23) = 2209 - 0 = 2209.

5. (22,-21): max(22,21)=22. y=-21 ≠ -22, x=22=m: right col: number = 45^2 - 7*22 + (-21) = 2025 - 154 - 21 = 2025 - 175 = 1850.

6. (24,-21): max(24,21)=24. y=-21: not bottom row. x=24=m: right col: number = 49^2 - 7*24 + (-21) = 2401 - 168 - 21 = 2401 - 189 = 2212.

7. (22,-23): max(22,23)=23. y=-23=-m: bottom row: number = 2209 - (23 - 22) = 2209 - 1 = 2208.

8. (24,-23): max(24,23)=24. y=-23 ≠ -24. x=24=m: right col: number = 2401 - 168 + (-23) = 2401 - 191 = 2210.

---

## 9. Sum of neighbors

List: 2025, 2211, 2027, 2209, 1850, 2212, 2208, 2210.

Sum:  
Pair them:  
2025+2027=4052  
2211+2209=4420  
1850+2212=4062  
2208+2210=4418  

Now sum pairs:  
4052+4420=8472  
4062+4418=8480  

Total: 8472+8480=16952.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{16952}
\]
