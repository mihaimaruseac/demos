Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

## 1. Understanding the spiral layout

The spiral given is:

```
...  5   4   3  ...
...  6   1   2  ...
...  7   8   9  ...
```

So the center is **1**, and the numbers spiral outward counterclockwise starting to the right (1, then 2, then up-left direction? Let's check carefully).

Actually, let's reconstruct the spiral pattern fully.

From the snippet:

Row1: 5 4 3  
Row2: 6 1 2  
Row3: 7 8 9  

So if we continue:  
Next layer:  
10 is to the left of 9? Wait, but standard Ulam spiral (counterclockwise from center):

Center 1, go right to 2, go up to 3,4,5,...? Let's check known pattern:

Known "Number spiral" starting at center 1, moving right, then up, then left, then down, etc.:

Positions:

Layer 1: 1 at (0,0)  
Right: 2 at (1,0)  
Up: 3 at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1)  
Left: 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1)  
Down: 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1)  
Then right again: 10 at (2,-1), etc.

Let's check coordinates:

1 at (0,0)  
2 at (1,0)  
3 at (1,1)  
4 at (0,1)  
5 at (-1,1)  
6 at (-1,0)  
7 at (-1,-1)  
8 at (0,-1)  
9 at (1,-1)  
10 at (2,-1)  
11 at (2,0)  
12 at (2,1)  
13 at (2,2)  
14 at (1,2)  
15 at (0,2)  
16 at (-1,2)  
17 at (-2,2)  
18 at (-2,1)  
19 at (-2,0)  
20 at (-2,-1)  
21 at (-2,-2)  
22 at (-1,-2)  
23 at (0,-2)  
24 at (1,-2)  
25 at (2,-2)  
26 at (3,-2)  
... and so on.

Yes, so the given snippet matches:

5 at (-1,1), 4 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1)  
6 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0)  
7 at (-1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1)

Correct.

## 2. Finding coordinates of 2026

We need a formula for coordinates.

Let's find which layer contains 2026.

Layer 0: just 1 (max = 1 = (2*0+1)^2 = 1)  
Layer 1: numbers 2 to 9 (max = 9 = (2*1+1)^2 = 9)  
Layer k: numbers from (2k-1)^2 + 1 to (2k+1)^2.

Check: k=1: from 2 to 9 (since (1)^2+1=2 to 3^2=9)  
k=2: from 10 to 25 (since 3^2+1=10 to 5^2=25)  
k=3: from 26 to 49 (since 5^2+1=26 to 7^2=49)  
etc.

So find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Try k=22: (2k-1)=43, 43^2=1849, (2k+1)=45, 45^2=2025. So 2025 is the last number of layer k=22.

So 2026 is the first number of layer k=23.

---

## 3. Coordinates for first number of layer k

First number of layer k is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=23: (2*23-1)=45, 45^2=2025, so 2026 = 45^2+1.

Where is it located?  

At the start of a layer, we start at coordinate (k, -(k-1))? Let's check pattern:

Layer k=1: first number after 1 is 2 at (1,0) = (k, 0) but k=1, so (1,0).  
Actually formula: first number of layer k is at (k, 1-k)?? Let's check:

k=1: (1,0) yes  
k=2: first=10 at (2,-1) = (k, -(k-1)) = (2,-1) yes  
k=3: first=26 at (3,-2) yes.

So first number of layer k is at (k, -(k-1)).

So for k=23: coordinates (23, -22).

---

## 4. Direction of spiral movement

We go:  
Start layer k: at (k, -(k-1))  
Move up: increase y by 1 each step until y=k.  
Then move left: decrease x by 1 until x=-k.  
Then move down: decrease y by 1 until y=-k.  
Then move right: increase x by 1 until x=k+1? Wait, but we end at x=k, y=-k, then move right to (k+1,-k) but that's next layer's start? Let's check small k.

Better: The layer k has side length 2k+1, so perimeter = 8k (except k=0). Actually let's check known formula:  
Layer k: start = (k, 1-k), end = (k, k)? Wait, let's track:

From known:  
Right: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k) → upward direction.  
Actually: start at (k, 1-k), go up to (k, k) (length = 2k-1 steps? Let's check k=2: start (2,-1) up to (2,2): y from -1 to 2 is 3 steps: -1,0,1,2 → 4 numbers? Actually number of points = difference in y +1 = 2k? Let's check carefully.)

Better to find 2026's coordinates directly.

---

## 5. Direct coordinate computation for 2026

We know 2025 = 45^2 is at (22,22)? Wait, last number of layer k=22 is (2k+1)^2 = (45)^2=2025 at (k,k) = (22,22).

Check: k=1: 9 at (1,1), yes. k=2: 25 at (2,2), yes.

So 2025 at (22,22).

Next number 2026: start new layer k=23: move right from (22,22) to (23,22)? Wait, but pattern: end of layer k at (k,k), then next number (first of layer k+1) is at (k+1, k). Yes.

So 2025 at (22,22), then 2026 at (23,22).

Let's verify with small k: k=1: 9 at (1,1), next 10 at (2,1) yes. k=2: 25 at (2,2), next 26 at (3,2) yes.

So indeed 2026 at (23,22).

(23+1,22-1)=(24,21)  
(23-1,22+1)=(22,23)  
(23-1,22-1)=(22,21)

## 7. Find numbers at these coordinates

We can find numbers from coordinates by layer.

A known formula: Let m = max(|x|,|y|). Then layer number k=m.

If y = m and x ≠ -m: on top edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + (m+x)  
If x = -m and y ≠ -m: on left edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + 2m + (m+y)  
If y = -m and x ≠ m: on bottom edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + 4m + (m-x)  
If x = m and y ≠ m: on right edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + 6m + (m-y)  
Corner cases: at (m,m) is (2m+1)^2? Wait, check: (m,m) is top-right corner: actually top edge formula fails at corner? Let's test systematically.

Better: Let’s compute directly for each neighbor:

---

### Neighbor 1: (24,22)

m = max(24,22)=24.  
Check position: x=24, y=22 → x=m, y≠m → right edge.  
Number = (2m-1)^2 + 6m + (m-y)  
m=24: (47)^2 + 6*24 + (24-22) = 2209 + 144 + 2 = 2355.

---

### Neighbor 2: (22,22)

m=22, x=22, y=22 → corner (m,m) = end of layer m: number = (2m+1)^2? Wait: (m,m) is top-right corner: Actually top edge: y=m formula: (2m-1)^2 + (m+x) = (43)^2 + (22+22) = 1849+44=1893? That’s wrong because (22,22) is 2025.

Let's check: known: layer k=22: max x,y=22. Start at (22,-21), go up to (22,22). So (22,22) is last of top edge.

Top edge formula: (2m-1)^2 + (m+x), but for (m,m): (43)^2 + (22+22) = 1849+44=1893? That’s wrong because 2025 is correct.

So maybe my formula wrong. Let's derive for (22,22):

We know 2025 = 45^2 = (2*22+1)^2. Yes! So corner (m,m) number = (2m+1)^2.

So (22,22): m=22, number = (45)^2 = 2025.

---

### Neighbor 3: (23,23)

m=23, x=23, y=23 → corner (m,m): number = (2m+1)^2 = (47)^2 = 2209.

---

### Neighbor 4: (23,21)

m=23, x=23, y=21 → right edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + 6m + (m-y)  
m=23: (45)^2 + 138 + (23-21) = 2025 + 138 + 2 = 2165.

---

### Neighbor 5: (24,23)

m=24, x=24, y=23 → right edge: number = (47)^2 + 6*24 + (24-23) = 2209 + 144 + 1 = 2354.

---

### Neighbor 6: (24,21)

m=24, x=24, y=21 → right edge: number = 2209 + 144 + (24-21) = 2209+144+3=2356.

---

### Neighbor 7: (22,23)

m=23, x=22, y=23 → top edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + (m+x) = (45)^2 + (23+22) = 2025 + 45 = 2070.

---

### Neighbor 8: (22,21)

m=22, x=22, y=21 → right edge: number = (2m-1)^2 + 6m + (m-y) = (43)^2 + 132 + (22-21) = 1849 + 132 + 1 = 1982.

---
