Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

---

## 1. Understanding the spiral pattern

The spiral given is:

```
...  5   4   3  ...
...  6   1   2  ...
...  7   8   9  ...
```

This is the standard Ulam spiral starting at 1 in the center, moving right first, then up-left-down-right in a counterclockwise fashion (or possibly clockwise — let's check).

From 1, go right to 2, then turn left (or counterclockwise) means: from 2, next step is up? Let's list coordinates to be sure.

Better: Let's assign coordinates to numbers:

Start: 1 at (0,0).

Move right: 2 at (1,0).
Move up: 3 at (1,1).
Move left twice: 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1).
Move down twice: 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1).
Move right twice: 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1).
Move up twice: 10 at (1,0)? Wait, that's occupied already — so no, let's track carefully.

Actually, known pattern:  
Number 1 at (0,0).  
Right: 2 at (1,0).  
Up: 3 at (1,1).  
Left: 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1).  
Down: 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1).  
Right: 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1).  
Up: 10 at (1,0)? That's wrong — 10 should be at (2,-1)? Let's check known sequence: Spiral goes:  

1 center, step east 2, step north 3, step west 4-5, step south 6-7, step east 8-9, step north 10-11, step west 12-13, etc.

Let's map small numbers:

1: (0,0)  
2: (1,0)  
3: (1,1)  
4: (0,1)  
5: (-1,1)  
6: (-1,0)  
7: (-1,-1)  
8: (0,-1)  
9: (1,-1)  
10: (2,-1)  
11: (2,0)  
12: (2,1)  
13: (2,2)  
14: (1,2)  
15: (0,2)  
16: (-1,2)  
17: (-2,2)  
18: (-2,1)  
19: (-2,0)  
20: (-2,-1)  
21: (-2,-2)  
22: (-1,-2)  
23: (0,-2)  
24: (1,-2)  
25: (2,-2)  
26: (3,-2)  
...

Yes — so direction order: East, North, West, South, East, North, West, South...  
Step length: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,...  

---

## 2. Locating 2026 in the spiral

We can find which square layer (ring) 2026 is in.

Ring k (k>=1) contains numbers from (2k-1)^2 + 1 to (2k+1)^2, centered around 1 at ring 0.

Check:  
Ring 1: 2 to 9 (max=3^2=9)  
Ring 2: 10 to 25 (max=5^2=25)  
Ring 3: 26 to 49 (max=7^2=49)  
Ring n: start = (2n-1)^2 + 1, end = (2n+1)^2.

Find n such that (2n-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2n+1)^2.

Try n=22: (2n-1)=43, 43^2=1849.  
Ring n=22: numbers 1850 to (45^2=2025). Wait — 2025 is max of ring 22.

So 2026 is in ring 23? Let's check:

Ring 23: start = 45^2+1=2026, end = (47^2=2209). Yes! So 2026 is the first number of ring 23.

---

## 3. Coordinates of 2026

Ring k has side length = 2k+1, start position for ring k:  
The first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2+1 at coordinate (k, 1-k) for k>=1? Let's check small k:

Ring 1 (k=1): start=2 at (1,0) — yes: k=1: (1, 1-1)=(1,0).  
Ring 2 (k=2): start=10 at (2,-1): formula (k,1-k)=(2,-1) yes.

So for k=23: start number 2026 at (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

Direction at start of ring:  
Ring k starts by going rightward? Actually, pattern:  
After number (2k-1)^2 at (k-1, -(k-1)), we take 1 step to the right to start ring k:  
From (k-1, -(k-1)) to (k, -(k-1))? Wait, check k=2:  
Number 9 at (1,-1), step right to (2,-1) for 10 — yes.

So start of ring k: coordinates = (k, -(k-1)) = (k, -k+1).

Check k=23: (23, -22). Yes matches earlier.

---

## 4. Neighbors of 2026

We need the 8 neighbors of (23,-22):

Neighbors:  
(22,-22), (24,-22) — left/right  
(23,-21), (23,-23) — up/down  
(22,-21), (24,-21), (22,-23), (24,-23) — diagonals.

---

## 5. Which numbers are at these positions?

Ring k=23 contains numbers 2026 to 2209. Side length = 2k+1=47.

We start at (23,-22) with 2026.

Path for ring k:  
1. Go right: from (k, -k+1) to (k, -k+1 + sideLength-1)? Wait, side length in grid = 2k+1, but number of steps per direction = 2k.

Actually, movement:  
East: from (k, -k+1) to (k, k) — length = 2k steps? Let's check k=2: start (2,-1) east to (2,2): steps: -1,0,1,2 → 4 numbers = 2k numbers indeed.

So:  
Segment 1 (East): from (k, -k+1) to (k, k), numbers increase by 1 each step.  
Segment 2 (North): from (k, k) to (-k, k), length=2k steps.  
Segment 3 (West): from (-k, k) to (-k, -k), length=2k steps.  
Segment 4 (South): from (-k, -k) to (k, -k), length=2k steps.  
But last segment ends just before start.

---

Let's find coordinates of 2026's neighbors by locating their positions relative to ring path.

Better: Let's find exactly which numbers are at neighbor coords.

---

We can find coordinates difference from start:  
At (23,-22): value=2026.

Move east: next number 2027 at (23,-21).  
So (23,-21) = 2027.  
(23,-23) would be before start? That would be last part of ring: the south side.

Actually south side: from (-23,-23) to (23,-23). Our point (23,-22) is on east side? Wait, start ring k: (k,-k+1) is top-right corner? Let's check k=2: (2,-1) is on east side, yes. So moving east means increasing y by 1.

So indeed:  
(23,-22): 2026  
(23,-21): 2027  
(23,-23): would be on south side: south side goes from (-23,-23) to (23,-23), increasing x. Which number is at (23,-23)? That's the last position of ring before reaching start again.

Let's compute:  
Start ring k=23: first number 2026 at (23,-22).  
East: length=2k=46 steps: goes to (23,-22+46)=(23,24)? Wait, that's too far — mistake: step east: y increases from -22 to k=23: that's from -22 to 23: difference 45 steps? Actually number of points from y=-22 to y=23 inclusive = 46 points = 2k? Check: 23-(-22)=45, plus 1 = 46. Yes 2k=46.

So east side: (23, y) for y from -22 to 23. Numbers 2026 to 2026+45=2071.

So (23,-21) = 2027.

---

North side: start (23,23) with 2072, go north to (-23,23): length 46 steps: numbers 2072 to 2072+45=2117.

West side: start (-23,23) with 2118, go west to (-23,-23): length 46 steps: numbers 2118 to 2118+45=2163.

South side: start (-23,-23) with 2164, go south to (23,-23): length 46 steps: numbers 2164 to 2164+45=2209.

---

So coordinates:  
(23,-23) is the end of south side: number = 2209.  
(23,-21) = 2027.  
(22,-22): is it on east side? No, east side x=23 fixed. So (22,-22) is inside the ring? Wait, ring is all points with max(|x|,|y|)=23. So (22,-22) has max=22, so it's in ring k=22 (previous ring). So its number is between 1850 and 2025.

Similarly (24,-22) would be outside ring k=23 (max coord=23), so it's in ring k=24? Actually no, max(|x|,|y|)=24 means ring k=24, numbers from (47^2+1)=2026? Wait, 47^2=2209, so ring k=24 starts at 2210. So (24,-22) is in future ring, so empty? No, spiral covers all integers, so (24,-22) is a number in ring 24: first number 2210 at (24,-23) etc. So (24,-22) is 2211? Let's check later.

Better approach: Let's find all 8 neighbors' values systematically.

---

## 6. Systematic neighbor finding

We know 2026 at (23,-22).

Neighbors:

1. (23,-21) = 2027 (east neighbor on same east side)  
2. (23,-23) = 2209 (south side end)  
3. (22,-22): x=22, y=-22, max(|x|,|y|)=22 → ring k=22. Which side? Coordinate (22,-22): on south side of ring k=22: south side of ring k: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k). For k=22, south side: from (-22,-22) to (22,-22), increasing x. Number at (22,-22): start south side number = (2k-1)^2+1 + 3*2k? Let's compute:

Ring k=22: start= (43^2+1)=1850 at (22,-21) [east side start].  
East side: 1850 to 1850+43? Wait length=2k=44 steps: 1850 to 1893.  
North side: 1894 to 1937.  
West side: 1938 to 1981.  
South side: 1982 to 1982+43=2025.

South side: from (-22,-22) to (22,-22): start 1982 at (-22,-22), each step right increases x by 1.  
At x=22, that's the last number of south side: 2025.

So (22,-22) = 2025.

4. (24,-22): max=24 → ring k=24, starts at 47^2+1=2210 at (24,-23). East side: (24,y) y from -23 to 24. At y=-22: second number? Start 2210 at (24,-23), next 2211 at (24,-22). So (24,-22)=2211.

5. (22,-21): max=22 → ring k=22. Coordinate: on east side of ring 22: east side: x=22, y from -21 to 22. Start 1850 at (22,-21). So (22,-21)=1850.

6. (24,-21): max=24 → ring k=24. East side: (24,y), y from -23 to 24. At y=-21: start y=-23: 2210, y=-22:2211, y=-21:2212. So (24,-21)=2212.

7. (22,-23): max=23? Wait x=22,y=-23 → max=23 → ring k=23. Which side? West side: x=-23 fixed? No, here x=22, so not west. South side: y=-23 fixed, x from -23 to 23. At x=22: near end. South side numbers: start 2164 at (-23,-23), each step right: +1 to x. At x=22: that's 2164 + (22 - (-23)) = 2164 + 45 = 2209? Wait, that's same as (23,-23)? Check: south side: (-23,-23) to (23,-23), numbering: 2164 at (-23,-23), so at x=22: number = 2164 + [22 - (-23)] = 2164 + 45 = 2209. But (23,-23) also 2209? That would mean two points with same number? Mist: south side ends at (23,-23) with 2209, so at x=22: number = 2209 - 1 = 2208. Let's check count:  
Points on south side: (-23,-23)..#(23,-23): 47 points. Numbers 2164 to 2164+46=2210? Wait, earlier I said length=46 steps (2k=46), so numbers 2164 to 2164+45=2209. That's 46 numbers. So first point (-23,-23)=2164, last point (23,-23)=2209. So at x=22: number = 2209 - 1 = 2208.

So (22,-23)=2208.

8. (24,-23): max=24 → ring k=24. Start ring 24: 2210 at (24,-23). So (24,-23)=2210.

---

## 7. List of neighbors:

Up: (23,-21)=2027  
Down: (23,-23)=2209  
Left: (22,-22)=2025  
Right: (24,-22)=2211  
NW: (22,-21)=1850  
NE: (24,-21)=2212  
SW: (22,-23)=2208  
SE: (24,-23)=2210

---

## 8. Sum of neighbors

Sum = 2027 + 2209 + 2025 + 2211 + 1850 + 2212 + 2208 + 2210.

Group:  
2027+2025=4052  
2209+2211=4420  
1850+2212=4062  
2208+2210=4418

Now: 4052+4420=8472  
4062+4418=8480  
8472+8480=16952.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{16952}
\]
