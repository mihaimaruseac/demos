Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

---

## **1. Understanding the spiral**

The spiral given is:

```
... 5  4  3 ...
... 6  1  2 ...
... 7  8  9 ...
```

This is the standard Ulam spiral (counterclockwise starting with 1 at the center, going right first).

Let's label coordinates:  
Let’s set **1** at coordinates \((0,0)\).

Movement pattern:  
Start at 1, go **right** (east) to 2, then **up** (north) to 3, then **left** (west) to 4,5, then **down** (south) to 6,7, then **right** to 8,9,10, etc.

Actually, let's check carefully.

**Step-by-step coordinates:**

1 at (0,0)  
2 at (1,0)  
3 at (1,1)  
4 at (0,1)  
5 at (-1,1)  
6 at (-1,0)  
7 at (-1,-1)  
8 at (0,-1)  
9 at (1,-1)  
10 at (2,-1)  
11 at (2,0)  
12 at (2,1)  
13 at (2,2)  
14 at (1,2)  
15 at (0,2)  
16 at (-1,2)  
17 at (-2,2)  
18 at (-2,1)  
19 at (-2,0)  
20 at (-2,-1)  
21 at (-2,-2)  
22 at (-1,-2)  
23 at (0,-2)  
24 at (1,-2)  
25 at (2,-2)  
26 at (3,-2)  
...

## **2. Locating 2026**

We need the coordinates of 2026.

Let’s find which square ring (layer) it’s in.

**Ring k** (k=0 is just {1}, k=1 is numbers 2..9, k=2 is 10..25, etc.)  
Ring k has numbers from \((2k-1)^2 + 1\) to \((2k+1)^2\), but careful:

Actually:  
Ring 0: center 1  
Ring 1: numbers 2 to 9 (max 3x3 square, side length 3)  
Ring 2: numbers 10 to 25 (side length 5)  
Ring 3: numbers 26 to 49 (side length 7)  
Ring n: side length = 2n+1, numbers from \((2n-1)^2+1\) to \((2n+1)^2\).

Check:  
n=1: from 2 to 9 ( (1)^2+1=2 to 3^2=9)  
n=2: from 10 to 25 (3^2+1=10 to 5^2=25)  
n=3: from 26 to 49 (5^2+1=26 to 7^2=49)  
n=4: from 50 to 81 (7^2+1=50 to 9^2=81)  
n=5: from 82 to 121 (9^2+1=82 to 11^2=121)  
...

So ring index n has numbers: start = \((2n-1)^2+1\), end = \((2n+1)^2\).

---

We find n such that \((2n-1)^2+1 \le 2026 \le (2n+1)^2\).

Try n=22:  
(2n-1)=43, 43^2=1849, start=1850, end=(45)^2=2025 → 2025 is in ring 22? Wait, 2025=45^2 is the last number of ring 22? Let’s check:

n=22: side length=2n+1=45, numbers from (43)^2+1=1849+1=1850 to (45)^2=2025. Yes.

So 2025 is the last number of ring n=22.

Thus 2026 is the first number of ring n=23.

---

**Ring n=23**: start=2026, end=(47)^2=2209, side length=47.

---

## **3. Coordinates for first number of a ring**

First number of ring n is at coordinates: starting position after completing ring n-1.

Ring n-1 ends at number (2n-1)^2 at position (n-1, -(n-1))? Let's check pattern:

End of ring n:  
Ring 1 ends at 9 at (1,-1)  
Ring 2 ends at 25 at (2,-2)  
Ring 3 ends at 49 at (3,-3)  
So ring n ends at (n,-n).

So ring 22 ends at 2025 at (22,-22).

---

Now, first number of ring n is 1 step to the right from the end of ring n-1? Wait, no: After finishing ring n-1, we are at (n-1,-(n-1)), then we take 1 step right to start ring n.

But careful: Actually, the spiral goes:  
From end of ring n-1 at (n-1,-(n-1)), step right to (n,-(n-1)), that’s the first number of ring n.

So for n=23:  
End of ring 22: (22,-22)  
Step right: (23,-22) is the coordinate of 2026.

---

## **4. Neighbors of 2026**

Coordinates of 2026: (23,-22).

Neighbors:  
N: (23,-21)  
NE: (24,-21)  
E: (24,-22)  
SE: (24,-23)  
S: (23,-23)  
SW: (22,-23)  
W: (22,-22)  
NW: (22,-21)

---

## **5. Which numbers are these?**

We need to find numbers at these coordinates in the spiral.

We can use: In ring n, side length L=2n+1.

Ring n=23: L=47, numbers 2026..2209.

We can locate by which side the coordinate lies on.

---

**Coordinate (23,-22)**: This is on the **right side** of ring n=23? Let’s check orientation:

Ring n layout:  
Bottom side: y=-n, x from n-1 down to -(n-1)? Wait, let's recall:

For ring n:  
Right side: x=n, y from -(n-1) up to n (but not including corner? Actually corners belong to one side each uniquely except starting corner).

Better: Let’s trace path for ring n=23:

Start: (23,-22) is the first number (2026). Then go up to (23,-21) (2027), etc., up to top-right corner (23,23)? That’s too many steps.

Actually:  
Ring n: start at (n, -(n-1)), go up to (n,n) [top-right corner], then left to (-n,n) [top-left], then down to (-n,-n) [bottom-left], then right to (n,-n) [bottom-right], then up to (n,-(n-1)) but stop before reaching start because that’s the next ring’s start.

Wait, that’s wrong: The start is bottom-right corner? Let’s check small n:

n=2: start 10 at (2,-1) [right side], go up to (2,2) [top-right], left to (-2,2), down to (-2,-2), right to (2,-2), up to (2,-1) (but 10 already used). Actually 10 is at (2,-1), then 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2), 14 at (1,2), etc. So indeed start is on the right side, y from -(n-1) to n.

So for n=23: start at (23,-22), numbers increase going up along x=23 from y=-22 to y=23.

Thus:  
2026 at (23,-22)  
2027 at (23,-21)  
… up to 2026 + (22+23) = 2026+45 = 2071 at (23,23)? Wait: from y=-22 to y=23 is 23-(-22)+1=46 steps? Actually count: -22 to 23 inclusive: 46 numbers. So 2026..2071 are on right side.

So neighbor N: (23,-21) is **2027**.

NE: (24,-21) — that’s outside ring 23, so part of ring 24? No, 24 is bigger ring, but 2026’s NE is not yet present in spiral? Wait, but 2026’s neighbors: some are in ring 22 (previous ring), some in ring 23 (same ring), some in ring 24 (next ring)? Actually no — NE of (23,-22) is (24,-21) which is in next ring (n=24) but next ring starts at (24,-23) maybe? Let’s check: ring 24 starts at (24,-23) (number 2210). So (24,-21) is above that start point, so it’s a later number in ring 24.

But easier: We can find numbers by using the fact that corners are squares of odd integers.

Better approach: Use closed-form coordinate-to-number mapping.

---

## **6. Coordinate-to-number formula**

There’s a known formula for this spiral (counterclockwise, starting right):

If max(|x|,|y|) = k, then:

For right side (x=k): number = (2k-1)^2 + (k+y)  
For top side (y=k): number = (2k-1)^2 + 3k - x  
For left side (x=-k): number = (2k-1)^2 + 5k - y  
For bottom side (y=-k): number = (2k-1)^2 + 7k + x  

Wait, check small k: Let’s test k=2, coordinate (2,0):  
(2*2-1)^2=9, plus (2+0)=2, total 11 — correct.

Let’s test top side: (0,2): 9 + 3*2 - 0 = 15 — correct.

So formula works.

---

## **7. Apply to neighbors**

We know 2026 is at (23,-22), k=23 (since max(|23|,|-22|)=23).

So 2026 = (2*23-1)^2 + (23 + (-22)) = 45^2 + 1 = 2025+1=2026. Good.

---

**Neighbors:**

1. N: (23,-21): k=23, x=23 → formula: 2025 + (23 + (-21)) = 2025 + 2 = 2027.
2. NE: (24,-21): k=max(24,21)=24. Which side? x=24=k → right side: number = (2*24-1)^2 + (24 + (-21)) = 47^2 + 3 = 2209 + 3 = 2212.
3. E: (24,-22): k=24, x=24 → right side: 2209 + (24 + (-22)) = 2209 + 2 = 2211.
4. SE: (24,-23): k=24, x=24 → right side: 2209 + (24 + (-23)) = 2209 + 1 = 2210 (start of ring 24).
5. S: (23,-23): k=23, y=-23 → bottom side: formula for bottom: (2k-1)^2 + 7k + x = 2025 + 7*23 + 23 = 2025 + 161 + 23 = 2025 + 184 = 2209? Wait check: 7*23=161, +23=184, plus 2025=2209. That’s the last number of ring 23.
6. SW: (22,-23): k=23, y=-23 → bottom side: 2025 + 7*23 + x = 2025 + 161 + 22 = 2025 + 183 = 2208.
7. W: (22,-22): k=23, x=22<23 → not on k=23 boundary, so it’s in ring 23 but left side? Wait, x=22, y=-22, max(22,22)=22, so k=22 actually! So it’s in ring 22.

For k=22, which side? x=22, but k=22 means x=22 is right side? But our coordinate (22,-22) has max(22,22)=22, so indeed k=22. But ring 22’s right side is x=22, y from -21 to 22. Our y=-22 is not on right side, so maybe bottom side? y=-22=k? Actually k=22, y=-22 is bottom side.

Bottom side formula: (2k-1)^2 + 7k + x = (43)^2 + 7*22 + 22 = 1849 + 154 + 22 = 1849+176=2025. That’s the last number of ring 22! Yes: 2025 at (22,-22). Good.

So W neighbor is 2025.

8. NW: (22,-21): k=22 (max(22,21)=22), coordinate (22,-21) is on right side of ring 22: formula: (43)^2 + (22 + (-21)) = 1849 + 1 = 1850.

---

## **8. List neighbors and sum**

N: 2027  
NE: 2212  
E: 2211  
SE: 2210  
S: 2209  
SW: 2208  
W: 2025  
NW: 1850

Sum = add them.

Pair them:  
2027+2025=4052  
2212+1850=4062  
2211+2209=4420  
2210+2208=4418

Sum of pairs: 4052+4062=8114, 4420+4418=8838  
Total=8114+8838=16952.

---

**Final answer:**
\[
\boxed{16952}
\]
