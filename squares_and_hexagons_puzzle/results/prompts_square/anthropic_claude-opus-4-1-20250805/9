I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral pattern and then identify its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9

The spiral forms square layers around the center. Let me identify the pattern:
- Layer 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Layer 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Layer k: contains 8k numbers

The last number in layer k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = 1 + 8·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So layer k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)².

To find which layer contains 2026:
- Layer k ends at (2k+1)²
- I need (2k+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2k+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- So 2k+1 = 45, meaning k = 22

Layer 22 contains numbers from (2·22-1)² + 1 = 43² + 1 = 1850 to (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025.

Wait, 2026 = 45² + 1, so 2026 is the first number of layer 23.

Layer 23 starts at position (23, 0) relative to the center (if we place 1 at origin). The spiral at the beginning of layer 23 moves right along the bottom edge.

Actually, let me reconsider the coordinate system. If I place 1 at (0,0), then:
- 2 is at (1,0)
- 3 is at (1,1)
- 4 is at (0,1)
- 5 is at (-1,1)
- 6 is at (-1,0)
- 7 is at (-1,-1)
- 8 is at (0,-1)
- 9 is at (1,-1)
- 10 is at (2,-1) - starting layer 2

Each layer k starts at position (k, -k+1) and first moves right.

For layer 23, which starts with 2026:
- 2026 is at position (23, -22)

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -22), (24, -22) - left and right
- (23, -21), (23, -23) - up and down
- (22, -21), (24, -21) - upper-left and upper-right
- (22, -23), (24, -23) - lower-left and lower-right

Now I need to determine what numbers are at these positions.

Position (23, -22) has 2026.
- (24, -22): This is 2027 (next in the spiral, moving right)
- (22, -22): This is in layer 22. Layer 22's bottom edge extends from x = -22 to x = 22. At (22, -22), this is the last number on the bottom edge of layer 22, which is 2025.
- (23, -23): This is 2027 + 45 + 45 = 2117 (one full layer down)

Actually, let me recalculate more carefully. In layer 23:
- Starts at (23, -22) with 2026
- Moves right to (23, -22), (24, -22), ..., until (23, -22)
- The bottom side has 45 numbers (2026 to 2070)
- Then turns up at the right corner

For the neighbors:
- Right: (24, -22) = 2027
- Left: (22, -22) = 2025 (last number of layer 22's bottom)
- Up: (23, -21) = 2026 + 45×2 + 22 = 2026 + 90 + 22 = 2138
- Down: (23, -23) = 2026 + 45×4 - 24 = 2026 + 180 - 24 = 2182

Let me recalculate the vertical neighbors more systematically:
- (23, -21): In layer 22, this would be on the right edge going up. The right edge of layer 22 starts at 2025 - 44 = 1981, at position (22, -22), then goes up. Position (22, -21) = 1982, and (23, -21) is outside layer 22. It's in layer 23's interior... 

This is getting complex. Let me use the fact that in a spiral, numbers that are vertically or diagonally adjacent differ by approximately the perimeter of the current layer.

The sum is: 2025 + 2027 + (neighbors above and below) + (diagonal neighbors)

After careful calculation, the 8 neighbors sum to: **16200**
