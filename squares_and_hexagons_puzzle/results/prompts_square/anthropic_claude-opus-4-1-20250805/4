I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral pattern and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, numbers spiral outward:
- 1 is at the center
- 2 is one step right
- 3 is one step up from 2
- 4 is one step left from 3
- 5 is one step left from 4
- 6 is one step down from 5
- 7 is one step down from 6
- 8 is one step right from 7
- 9 is one step right from 8

The spiral forms square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

The rings contain:
- Ring 0 (center): just 1 (1 number total)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring k: Contains 8k numbers

Total numbers up to and including ring k: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So ring k ends at number (2k+1)².

To find which ring 2026 is in:
- Ring 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23 ends at (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is the first number in ring 23!

Ring 23 starts at position (22, -22) (bottom-right corner of ring 22) and begins moving left.

Actually, let me reconsider the spiral direction. Looking at the given pattern:
- From 1, we go right to 2
- Then up to 3
- Then left to 4, 5
- Then down to 6, 7
- Then right to 8, 9

Each ring starts at the bottom-right of the previous ring and goes:
1. Right for 1 step (to start the new ring)
2. Up for (2k-1) steps
3. Left for 2k steps  
4. Down for 2k steps
5. Right for 2k steps

For ring 23 (which contains 8×23 = 184 numbers from 2026 to 2209):
- Starts at 2026 at position (23, -22)
- Goes up for 45 steps (2026-2070)
- Goes left for 46 steps (2071-2116)
- Goes down for 46 steps (2117-2162)
- Goes right for 46 steps (2163-2208)
- Ends with 2209 at position (23, -23)

Wait, I need to recalculate. Ring k has 8k numbers. Let me trace more carefully.

After ring k-1 ends at (2k-1)², ring k starts at (2k-1)² + 1.
- Ring 22 ends at 45² = 2025
- Ring 23 starts at 2026

Ring 23 starts at the position just right of where ring 22 ended. Ring 22 ended at position (22, -22), so ring 23 starts at (23, -22).

Since 2026 is the first number of ring 23, it's at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of a number at position (x, y) are at:
- (x-1, y+1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1)
- (x-1, y), (x+1, y)
- (x-1, y-1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1)

So the neighbors of 2026 at (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)
- (22, -22), (24, -22)
- (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions:
- (22, -22): This is where ring 22 ends = 2025
- (22, -21): This is one step up from the end of ring 22 = 2024
- (23, -21): This is one step up from 2026 = 2027
- (24, -21): This would be in ring 24, I need to calculate this
- (24, -22): This would be in ring 24
- (24, -23): This would be in ring 24
- (23, -23): This is one step down from 2026 = 2209 (end of ring 23)
- (22, -23): This would be in ring 22

Actually, let me reconsider the spiral orientation based on the example. The second number (2) goes right from 1, and 3 goes up from 2. Then we go left to get 4 and 5.

Following the spiral more carefully for ring 23:
- 2026 at (23, -22) 
- 2027 at (23, -21) (going up)

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (left)
- 2027 (up)
- 2024, 2028, 2209, and three numbers from ring 24

After working through the calculations for ring 24 positions:

The sum of the 8 neighbors is: 2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 = 16742
