I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is at position (1, 0) - move right
- 3 is at position (1, 1) - move up
- 4 is at position (0, 1) - move left
- 5 is at position (-1, 1) - move left
- 6 is at position (-1, 0) - move down
- 7 is at position (-1, -1) - move down
- 8 is at position (0, -1) - move right
- 9 is at position (1, -1) - move right

The spiral moves in squares of increasing size. Let me identify the pattern:
- Ring 0: just the number 1
- Ring 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring k: contains 8k numbers

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So ring k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)².

Let me find which ring contains 2026:
- We need (2k+1)² ≥ 2026
- 2k+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
- k ≥ 22.005

So 2026 is in ring 23 (since ring 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025).

Actually, let me recalculate: 45² = 2025, so 2026 is the first number in ring 23.

Ring 23 starts at position (23, -22) (bottom-right corner + 1) and moves left.

Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the first number of ring 23.
The first number of ring k starts at position (k, -(k-1)) and moves left.

So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -22): This is in ring 22, on the bottom edge
- (22, -21): Ring 22
- (22, -23): Ring 23
- (23, -21): Ring 22  
- (23, -23): Ring 23
- (24, -21): Ring 23
- (24, -22): Ring 23
- (24, -23): Ring 23

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Ring 22 ends at 45² = 2025.
Ring 22 starts at 43² + 1 = 1850.

In ring 22:
- Bottom-right corner is at (22, -22): number 1850
- Moving left along bottom: positions (21, -22), (20, -22), ..., (-22, -22)
- Then up the left side, across the top, down the right side

Position (22, -22) has number 1850.
Position (22, -21) is 2025 (last number of ring 22, at corner before ring 23 starts).
Position (23, -21) is also in ring 22... wait, let me reconsider.

Actually, let me reconsider the spiral more carefully. Ring 22 has corners at (±22, ±22).
The last number 2025 is at position (22, -21) (moving up the right edge).
Then 2026 starts ring 23 at position (23, -21).

So 2026 is at position (23, -21).

The 8 neighbors are:
- (22, -22): In ring 22, position 1850 
- (22, -21): Number 2025
- (22, -20): Number 2024
- (23, -22): Number 2027
- (23, -20): Will be further along in ring 23
- (24, -22): Number 2028  
- (24, -21): Number 2029
- (24, -20): Number 2030

Wait, I need to trace this more carefully.

Ring 23 starts at 2026 and moves up from (23, -21) to (23, 22), that's 44 numbers (2026-2069).
Then left from (23, 22) to (-23, 22), that's 46 numbers (2070-2115).
Then down from (-23, 22) to (-23, -23), that's 46 numbers (2116-2161).
Then right from (-23, -23) to (23, -23), that's 46 numbers (2162-2207).
Then up from (23, -23) to (23, -22), just 1 number (2208).

So at position (23, -21) is 2026.
The neighbors are:
- (22, -22): 1851
- (22, -21): 2025
- (22, -20): 2024
- (23, -22): 2208
- (23, -20): 2027
- (24, -22): 2209
- (24, -21): 2210
- (24, -20): 2028

Sum = 1851 + 2025 + 2024 + 2208 + 2027 + 2209 + 2210 + 2028 = 16382
