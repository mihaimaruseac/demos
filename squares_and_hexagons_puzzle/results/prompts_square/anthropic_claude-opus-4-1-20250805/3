I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 moves right to (1, 0)
- 3 moves up to (1, 1)
- 4 moves left to (0, 1)
- 5 moves left to (-1, 1)
- 6 moves down to (-1, 0)
- 7 moves down to (-1, -1)
- 8 moves right to (0, -1)
- 9 moves right to (1, -1)

The spiral forms square rings. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Ring 0: just 1 (contains 1 number)
Ring 1: 2-9 (contains 8 numbers)
Ring 2: 10-25 (contains 16 numbers)
Ring k: contains 8k numbers

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = (2k+1)²

So I need to find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 22: last number is (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23: last number is (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

Since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, number 2026 is in ring 23.

2026 is the first number after 2025, so it's the first number of ring 23.

In each ring, the pattern starts by moving right from the bottom-right corner of the previous ring. The number 2025 = 45² is at position (22, -22) (bottom-right of ring 22).

So 2026 moves right to position (23, -22).

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -22): This is 2025
- (24, -22): This is 2027 (continues right)
- (22, -21): Need to determine
- (23, -21): Need to determine  
- (24, -21): Need to determine
- (22, -23): Need to determine
- (23, -23): Need to determine
- (24, -23): Need to determine

Let me trace ring 23 more carefully. Starting from 2026 at (23, -22):
- 2026 at (23, -22)
- 2027 at (24, -22)
- ... continues right until (45, -22)
- Then turns up along the right edge
- Then left along the top
- Then down along the left edge
- Then right along the bottom

The position (23, -23) is directly below 2026. This would be part of ring 24 (the next ring out). Ring 24 starts at 2210 and begins at position (23, -23).

So:
- (23, -23) = 2210
- (24, -23) = 2211
- (22, -23) = need to calculate

For position (22, -23), this is on the bottom edge of ring 23, moving from left to right. The bottom edge of ring 23 starts at (-23, -23) with some number and ends at (22, -23).

In ring 23:
- Total numbers: 8×23 = 184
- Numbers 2026 to 2209
- Right edge: 2026 to 2071 (46 numbers)
- Top edge: 2072 to 2117 (46 numbers)  
- Left edge: 2118 to 2163 (46 numbers)
- Bottom edge: 2164 to 2209 (46 numbers)

Position (22, -23) is the last number on the bottom edge = 2209.

For positions above 2026:
- (23, -21) is on the right edge, 1 position up from 2026 = 2072
- (24, -21) is inside ring 22. Ring 22 position (22, -21) = 1980, so (24, -21) would be... wait, that's not in ring 22.

Let me reconsider. Position (24, -21) is in ring 24. Similarly for (22, -21).

Actually, let me recalculate. At (23, -22), the neighbors are:
- Same row: (22, -22) and (24, -22)
- Row above: (22, -21), (23, -21), (24, -21)  
- Row below: (22, -23), (23, -23), (24, -23)

(22, -22) = 2025 ✓
(24, -22) = 2027 ✓
(23, -21) = 2072 ✓
(22, -21) = 1979 (ring 22, one position up from corner)
(24, -21) = 2073 (ring 23, two positions up)
(22, -23) = 2209 ✓
(23, -23) = 2210 ✓
(24, -23) = 2211 ✓

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2072 + 1979 + 2073 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 = 16806
