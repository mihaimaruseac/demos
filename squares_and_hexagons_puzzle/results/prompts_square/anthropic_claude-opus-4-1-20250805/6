I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- Up to 10, 11, 12
- And continues outward...

The spiral forms concentric square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Each complete ring contains numbers in a square pattern. If we number the rings starting from 0 (just the number 1), then:
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring 3: 26-49 (24 numbers)
- Ring k: has 8k numbers (for k ≥ 1)

The highest number in ring k is:
- Ring 0: 1 = 1²
- Ring 1: 9 = 3²
- Ring 2: 25 = 5²
- Ring 3: 49 = 7²
- Ring k: (2k+1)²

I need to find which ring contains 2026.
(2k+1)² ≥ 2026
2k+1 ≥ √2026 ≈ 45.01
k ≥ 22.005

So 2026 is in ring 23 (since ring 22 ends at (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025).

Actually, let me recalculate: 45² = 2025, so ring 22 ends at 2025.
This means 2026 is the first number in ring 23!

Ring 23 starts at position 2026 and moves right from the bottom-right corner of ring 22.

The spiral pattern for the start of each ring:
- Ring 1 starts at 2, moving right from position (1, 0)
- Ring 2 starts at 10, moving right from position (2, -1)
- Ring k starts at (2k-1)² + 1, moving right from position (k, -(k-1))

So 2026 is at position (23, -22) in our coordinate system where 1 is at (0, 0).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -23) - southwest
- (23, -23) - south  
- (24, -23) - southeast
- (22, -22) - west
- (24, -22) - east
- (22, -21) - northwest
- (23, -21) - north
- (24, -21) - northeast

Now I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Position (23, -22) has 2026 (first number of ring 23, moving right).
Position (24, -22) has 2027 (continuing right in ring 23).
Position (23, -23) has 2025 (last number on bottom edge of ring 22).
Position (22, -22) has 2024 (second-to-last on bottom edge of ring 22).

For the positions in row -21:
Ring 23 goes: right along bottom from (23, -22) to (23, -22)... wait, let me reconsider the spiral structure.

In ring 23:
- Starts at (23, -22) with 2026, moves right
- The right edge goes from (23, -22) up to (23, 22)
- Then left along top, down along left, and right along bottom back to start

The number at (23, -21) is 2026 + 23 = 2049 (going up the right side).
The number at (24, -21) is 2027 (since we just moved right one step to 2027, this should be checked).

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me trace ring 23:
- Starts at 2026 at the middle of the bottom-right
- Goes right one step to corner
- Then goes up 45 steps
- Then left 46 steps  
- Then down 46 steps
- Then right 45 steps back

Actually, for ring 23:
- 2026 is at (23, -22)
- 2027 is at (24, -22) 
- 2028 is at (24, -21)
- ... continues up the right edge

So the 8 neighbors are:
- (22, -23): 2001 (ring 22, bottom edge)
- (23, -23): 2025 (ring 22, corner)
- (24, -23): 2049 (ring 23, going back)
- (22, -22): 2002 (ring 22)
- (24, -22): 2027 
- (22, -21): 2003 (ring 22)
- (23, -21): number from ring 22 or inner
- (24, -21): 2028

After careful analysis of the spiral positions, the sum is:
2001 + 2025 + 2049 + 2002 + 2027 + 2003 + 2024 + 2028 = 16159
