I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center:
- 1 is at position (0, 0)
- 2 is at position (1, 0) - move right
- 3 is at position (1, 1) - move up
- 4 is at position (0, 1) - move left
- 5 is at position (-1, 1) - move left
- 6 is at position (-1, 0) - move down
- 7 is at position (-1, -1) - move down
- 8 is at position (0, -1) - move right
- 9 is at position (1, -1) - move right

The spiral moves in squares of increasing size. Let me analyze the pattern:
- Layer 0: just 1
- Layer 1: numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Layer 2: numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Layer k: contains 8k numbers

The last number in layer k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = (2k+1)²

So layer k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)².

To find which layer 2026 is in:
- Layer 22: ends at (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Layer 23: ends at (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is the first number in layer 23 (since layer 22 ends at 2025).

In each layer, the spiral starts from the bottom-right corner and goes:
1. Right (1 step for the first number)
2. Up (2k+1 steps)
3. Left (2k+1 steps)
4. Down (2k+1 steps)
5. Right (2k steps to complete)

For layer 23, starting at position (23, -22):
- 2026 is at position (23, -22) (first position, moving right from end of layer 22)

Actually, let me reconsider. At the end of layer k, we're at position (k, -k). 
Layer k+1 starts by moving right to (k+1, -k).

So at the end of layer 22 (number 2025), we're at position (22, -22).
Number 2026 (first of layer 23) is at position (23, -22).

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are:
- (22, -23): Let me find this number
- (22, -22): This is 2025 (end of layer 22)
- (22, -21): Let me find this number
- (23, -23): Let me find this number
- (23, -21): This is 2027 (next in the spiral)
- (24, -23): Let me find this number
- (24, -22): Let me find this number
- (24, -21): Let me find this number

For layer 22:
- Starts at 1937 (since (2·21+1)² = 1849 and layer 22 starts at 1850 = 1849 + 1)
- Actually, layer 21 ends at 43² = 1849, so layer 22 starts at 1850
- Layer 22 goes from 1850 to 2025

Let me trace layer 22 more carefully:
- Starts at (22, -21) with 1850
- Goes up to (22, 22): numbers 1850-1893 (44 numbers)
- Goes left to (-22, 22): numbers 1894-1937 (44 numbers)  
- Goes down to (-22, -22): numbers 1938-1981 (44 numbers)
- Goes right to (22, -22): numbers 1982-2025 (44 numbers)

So (22, -22) = 2025 and (22, -21) = 1850.

For layer 23:
- (23, -22) = 2026
- (23, -21) = 2027
- (23, -23) would be in layer 24

For layer 24:
- Starts at 2026 + 8·23 = 2026 + 184 = 2210... No wait, layer 23 ends at 47² = 2209
- Layer 24 starts at 2210 at position (24, -23)

So:
- (24, -23) = 2210
- (24, -22) = 2211  
- (24, -21) = 2212

And for the remaining neighbors:
- (22, -23) is in layer 23, on the right edge going from bottom
- Layer 23: from (23, -22) goes up to (23, 23), that's 2026 to 2071
- Then left to (-23, 23), then down to (-23, -23), then right
- The bottom edge goes from (-23, -23) right to (22, -23)
- That's near the end: 2209 - 0 = 2209 at (22, -23)

The 8 neighbors sum to:
2209 + 2025 + 1850 + 2210 + 2027 + 2211 + 2026 + 2212 = 16,568

Wait, let me recalculate. The neighbors are:
- (22, -23) = 2209
- (22, -22) = 2025  
- (22, -21) = 1850
- (23, -23) = 2210
- (23, -21) = 2027
- (24, -23) = 2211
- (24, -22) = 2212
- (24, -21) = 2213

Sum = 2209 + 2025 + 1850 + 2210 + 2027 + 2211 + 2212 + 2213 = 16,957
