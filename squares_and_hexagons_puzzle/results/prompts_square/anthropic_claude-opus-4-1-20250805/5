I need to find the position of 2026 in the spiral and then sum its 8 neighbors.

First, let me understand the spiral pattern. Starting from 1 at the center, the spiral moves:
- Right to 2
- Up to 3
- Left to 4, 5
- Down to 6, 7
- Right to 8, 9
- Up to 10, 11, 12
- Left to 13, 14, 15
- Down to 16, 17, 18
- Right to 19, 20, 21...

The spiral forms square "rings" around the center. Let me identify which ring 2026 is in.

Each complete ring contains numbers in a square pattern. If we number the rings starting from 0 (the center):
- Ring 0: just 1 (1 number total)
- Ring 1: 2-9 (8 numbers)
- Ring 2: 10-25 (16 numbers)
- Ring k: contains 8k numbers

The highest number in ring k is: 1 + 8(1 + 2 + ... + k) = 1 + 8·k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1) = 4k² + 4k + 1 = (2k+1)²

So ring k contains numbers from (2k-1)² + 1 to (2k+1)².

I need to find which ring contains 2026:
- Ring 22: ends at (2·22+1)² = 45² = 2025
- Ring 23: ends at (2·23+1)² = 47² = 2209

So 2026 is in ring 23, and it's the first number after 2025.

Ring 23 starts at 2026 (since ring 22 ends at 2025). The pattern for ring 23:
- Starts at bottom-right corner of ring 22
- Goes right for 1 step to reach the starting position
- Then up for 46 steps (2·23 steps)
- Then left for 47 steps
- Then down for 47 steps  
- Then right for 46 steps to complete

Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it's the first number of ring 23, located one step to the right of 2025.

2025 = 45² is at position (22, -22) - the bottom-right corner of ring 22.
So 2026 is at position (23, -22).

Now I need to find the 8 neighbors of position (23, -22):
- (22, -22): 2025
- (24, -22): 2027
- (22, -21): Need to find
- (23, -21): Need to find
- (24, -21): Need to find
- (22, -23): Need to find
- (23, -23): Need to find
- (24, -23): Need to find

Let me trace the spiral more carefully in this region:
- 2025 is at (22, -22) 
- 2026 is at (23, -22) - moves right from corner
- 2027 is at (24, -22) - continues right
- 2028 is at (24, -21) - turns up
- 2029 is at (24, -20) - continues up

For the positions below 2026:
Going backwards from 2025:
- 2024 is at (22, -21) 
- 2023 is at (22, -20)
...

Actually, let me reconsider. In ring 22:
- The bottom side goes from right to left
- 2025 is at corner (22, -22)
- 2024 is at (21, -22)
- 2023 is at (20, -22)
...

For position (23, -23), this would be part of ring 23's path going right initially.
Since 2026 is at (23, -22) and 2027 is at (23, -21) (going up), then:
- (23, -23) would be 1969 (going right along bottom of ring 22)
- Wait, let me recalculate...

Ring 22 bottom-right corner is at 2025. The bottom edge of ring 22 has 44 numbers (going right to left).
2025 - 43 = 1982 is at the bottom-left corner.
1982 + 21 = 2003 would be at (0, -22)
1982 + 22 = 2004 would be at (1, -22)

Let me recalculate the exact neighbors:
Starting from 2026 at the beginning of ring 23, the 8 neighbors are:
- 2025 (to the left)
- 2027 (to the right) 
- 1969 (below)
- 1970 (below-left)
- 1971 (below-right)
- 2081 (above)
- 2080 (above-left)
- 2082 (above-right)

Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 1969 + 1970 + 1971 + 2081 + 2080 + 2082 = 16205

Actually wait, let me be more systematic. 2026 starts ring 23, moving right then up.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is: **16208**
