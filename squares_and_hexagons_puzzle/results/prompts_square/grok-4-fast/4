## Explanation

The reasoning begins by determining the position of 2026 in the spiral grid, which starts at (0,0) for 1 and expands counterclockwise. The layer k for a number n is calculated as k = ceil((sqrt(n) - 1) / 2). For n = 2026, sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.011, so k = ceil((45.011 - 1) / 2) = 23. The starting position of layer 23 is at (23, -22), and since 2026 is the first number in this layer, its coordinates are (23, -22).

Next, the eight neighboring positions are identified: (22, -23), (22, -22), (22, -21), (23, -23), (23, -21), (24, -23), (24, -22), and (24, -21). The number at any position (x, y) is found using the formula based on its layer l = max(|x|, |y|). The base value for layer l is (2l - 1)^2 + 1, and the exact number depends on the side of the layer:

- Right side (x = l, y from 1 - l to l): base + (y - (1 - l))
- Top side (y = l, x from l - 1 to -l): base + 2l + (l - 1 - x)
- Left side (x = -l, y from l - 1 to -l): base + 4l + (l - 1 - y)
- Bottom side (y = -l, x from -l + 1 to l): base + 6l + (x - (-l + 1))

Applying this:

- (22, -23): l=23, bottom side, 2026 + 138 + 44 = 2208
- (22, -22): l=22, bottom side, 1850 + 132 + 43 = 2025
- (22, -21): l=22, right side, 1850 + 0 = 1850
- (23, -23): l=23, bottom side, 2026 + 138 + 45 = 2209
- (23, -21): l=23, right side, 2026 + 1 = 2027
- (24, -23): l=24, right side, 2210 + 0 = 2210
- (24, -22): l=24, right side, 2210 + 1 = 2211
- (24, -21): l=24, right side, 2210 + 2 = 2212

The sum of these values is calculated as 2208 + 2025 + 1850 + 2209 + 2027 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952.
