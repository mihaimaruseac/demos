## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the position of 2026 in the spiral grid. The spiral is counterclockwise, starting at (0,0) with 1, and layers are defined by k = max(|x|, |y|). The total numbers up to layer k is (2k+1)^2. For 2026, (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025, so 2026 is the first number in layer 23, at position (23, -22).

To find the numbers at the eight neighboring positions, a formula for the number at any (x, y) is used, based on the layer m = max(|x|, |y|) and the side of the layer:

- For the right side (x = m, 1-m ≤ y ≤ m): number = (2m-1)^2 + y + m
- For the top side (y = m, -m ≤ x ≤ m-1): number = (2m-1)^2 + 2m + (m - x)
- For the left side (x = -m, -m ≤ y ≤ m-1): number = (2m-1)^2 + 4m + (m - y)
- For the bottom side (y = -m, -m+1 ≤ x ≤ m): number = (2m-1)^2 + x + 7m

The neighbors and their numbers are calculated as follows:

- (22, -22): Bottom side of layer 22, number = (43)^2 + 22 + 7*22 = 2025
- (24, -22): Right side of layer 24, number = (47)^2 + (-22) + 24 = 2211
- (23, -21): Right side of layer 23, number = (45)^2 + (-21) + 23 = 2027
- (23, -23): Bottom side of layer 23, number = (45)^2 + 23 + 7*23 = 2209
- (22, -21): Right side of layer 22, number = (43)^2 + (-21) + 22 = 1850
- (24, -21): Right side of layer 24, number = (47)^2 + (-21) + 24 = 2212
- (22, -23): Bottom side of layer 23, number = (45)^2 + 22 + 7*23 = 2208
- (24, -23): Right side of layer 24, number = (47)^2 + (-23) + 24 = 2210

Summing these values: 2025 + 2211 + 2027 + 2209 + 1850 + 2212 + 2208 + 2210 = 16952.
