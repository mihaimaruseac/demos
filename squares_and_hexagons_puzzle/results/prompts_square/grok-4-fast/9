16952

## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the position of 2026 in the Ulam spiral, which starts at (0,0) for 1 and proceeds counterclockwise. The layer k of a number n is determined by finding the smallest k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n. For n=2026, sqrt(2026) ≈ 45.01, and 45^2=2025, so 2026 is in layer 23, specifically the first number after the end of layer 22 at (22,-22):2025. Thus, 2026 is at (23,-22), as it follows the rightward leg extending from the previous layer.

Next, the eight neighboring positions are: (22,-22), (24,-22), (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23), (22,-21), (24,-23), and (24,-21). The number at each position is found by analyzing the spiral's path in the relevant layers:

- (22,-22) is the end of layer 22: 2025.
- (23,-21) is the first position of the upward leg in layer 23, starting from (23,-22): 2027.
- (22,-21) is the start of layer 22 on its right side: 43^2 + 1 = 1850.
- (23,-23) is the end of layer 23: 47^2 = 2209.
- (22,-23) is the 45th position on the final rightward leg of layer 23 (at y=-23, from x=-22 to x=23): 2209 - 1 = 2208.
- (24,-23) is the start of layer 24, the 47th position of layer 23's final leg: 2210.
- (24,-22) and (24,-21) are the first and second positions of the upward leg in layer 24 (at x=24, starting from y=-23): 2211 and 2212, respectively.

The sum is then calculated: 2025 + 2211 + 2209 + 2027 + 2208 + 1850 + 2210 + 2212 = 16952.
