## Explanation

The reasoning begins by identifying the position of 2026 in the spiral grid. The spiral forms layers where layer k contains numbers up to (2k+1)^2. For 2026, sqrt(2026) ≈ 44.99, and 45^2 = 2025, so 2026 is the first number in layer 23, located at coordinates (23, -22).

Next, the eight neighboring positions are: (22, -22), (24, -22), (23, -21), (23, -23), (22, -23), (22, -21), (24, -23), and (24, -21). Each position's number is determined using the spiral's structure, where the layer l = max(|x|, |y|), and values on each side of the layer are calculated based on the starting value of that layer.

- For (22, -22) in layer 22 (bottom-right corner): (2·22 + 1)^2 = 2025.
- For (22, -21) in layer 22 (start of right side): (2·22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850.
- For (23, -21) in layer 23 (right side, offset 1 from start): 2025 + 2 = 2027.
- For (23, -23) in layer 23 (bottom-right corner): (2·23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209.
- For (22, -23) in layer 23 (bottom side, offset 45 from left corner): (47^2 - 46) + 45 = 2163 + 45 = 2208.
- For (24, -23) in layer 24 (start of right side): (2·24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2210.
- For (24, -22) in layer 24 (right side, offset 1): 2210 + 1 = 2211.
- For (24, -21) in layer 24 (right side, offset 2): 2210 + 2 = 2212.

The values are then summed: 2025 + 1850 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952.
