To solve this, we need to determine the pattern of the spiral and find the location of the number 2026.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The difference between the numbers on the diagonals increases by 2 for each step outwards. For example, the difference between 1 and 9 is 8, between 9 and 21 is 12, and so on.

Let's find the ring in which 2026 is located. The numbers on the diagonals of each ring are as follows:

1st ring: 1 (1)
2nd ring: 9, 2, 3, 4 (8, 2, 1, 1)
3rd ring: 21, 16, 17, 18, 19, 14, 15, 10, 11, 12, 13 (12, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1)
4th ring: 37, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22 (16, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1)

We can see that 2026 is not in the 4th ring, as the highest number in the 4th ring is 37. Let's move to the 5th ring:

5th ring: 57, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 49, 50, 51, 46, 47, 48, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 40, 39, 38 (20, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1)

The numbers in the 5th ring range from 37 to 57. Since 2026 is not in this ring either, we continue to the next ring.

6th ring: 81, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 73, 74, 75, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 65, 66, 67, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 59, 58 (24, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1)

The numbers in the 6th ring range from 57 to 81. Since 2026 is not in this ring either, we continue to the next ring.

7th ring: 109, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 101, 102, 103, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 93, 94, 95, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 85, 86, 87, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 (28, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

The numbers in the 7th ring range from 81 to 109. Since 2026 is not in this ring either, we continue to the next ring.

We would continue this process until we find the ring that contains the number 2026. However, this process is quite lengthy and not practical to do manually. Instead, we can write a program or use a more efficient method to find the ring and the position of 2026.

Once we find the position of 2026, we can then determine its 8 neighbors by looking at the numbers directly adjacent to it (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) and sum them up.

Since the exact position of 2026 is not easily determined manually, we would need a computational approach to find the exact location and then calculate the sum of its neighbors.
