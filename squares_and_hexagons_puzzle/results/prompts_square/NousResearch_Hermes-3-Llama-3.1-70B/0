To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the pattern of the spiral and where the number 2026 would be located on it.

The spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The numbers increase by 1 as you move along the spiral. The pattern of the spiral can be described as follows:

1. Move right one step (numbers 1, 2, 3, ...).
2. Move down one step (numbers 3, 4, 5, ...).
3. Move left two steps (numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, ...).
4. Move up two steps (numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, ...).
5. Move right three steps (numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, ...).
6. Move down three steps (numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, ...).
7. Move left four steps (numbers 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, ...).
8. Move up four steps (numbers 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, ...).

And so on, with the number of steps increasing by 1 in each direction as the spiral continues.

To find the location of 2026, we need to determine which "layer" of the spiral it is in. We can do this by summing the number of integers in each complete layer until we exceed 2026.

The first layer (1 to 9) has 9 numbers.
The second layer (10 to 24) has 15 numbers.
The third layer (25 to 49) has 25 numbers.
...

We can see that the number of integers in each layer follows an arithmetic progression where the common difference is 8 (the number of steps in each direction for each layer). The first term is 9, the second term is 15, and so on.

Let's denote the number of layers as n. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

We need to find n such that the sum of the first n layers is just greater than 2026.

Let's calculate the sum for each layer until we exceed 2026:

Layer 1: 9 numbers (1 to 9)
Layer 2: 15 numbers (10 to 24)
Layer 3: 25 numbers (25 to 49)
Layer 4: 35 numbers (50 to 84)
Layer 5: 49 numbers (85 to 133)
Layer 6: 63 numbers (134 to 196)
Layer 7: 81 numbers (197 to 277)
Layer 8: 99 numbers (278 to 376)
Layer 9: 121 numbers (377 to 497)
Layer 10: 143 numbers (498 to 640)
Layer 11: 169 numbers (641 to 809)
Layer 12: 197 numbers (810 to 1006)
Layer 13: 225 numbers (1007 to 1231)
Layer 14: 257 numbers (1232 to 1488)
Layer 15: 289 numbers (1489 to 1777)
Layer 16: 321 numbers (1778 to 2098)
Layer 17: 361 numbers (2099 to 2459)
Layer 18: 401 numbers (2460 to 2860)
Layer 19: 441 numbers (2861 to 3301)
Layer 20: 489 numbers (3302 to 3790)
Layer 21: 537 numbers (3791 to 4327)
Layer 22: 585 numbers (4328 to 4912)
Layer 23: 633 numbers (4913 to 5545)
Layer 24: 689 numbers (5546 to 6234)
Layer 25: 745 numbers (6235 to 6979)
Layer 26: 801 numbers (6980 to 7780)
Layer 27: 861 numbers (7781 to 8641)
Layer 28: 921 numbers (8642 to 9562)
Layer 29: 981 numbers (9563 to 10543)
Layer 30: 1041 numbers (10544 to 11584)
Layer 31: 1101 numbers (11585 to 12685)
Layer 32: 1161 numbers (12686 to 13846)
Layer 33: 1221 numbers (13847 to 15067)
Layer 34: 1281 numbers (15068 to 16348)
Layer 35: 1341 numbers (16349 to 17689)
Layer 36: 1401 numbers (17690 to 19090)
Layer 37: 1461 numbers (19091 to 20551)
Layer 38: 1521 numbers (20552 to 22072)
Layer 39: 1581 numbers (22073 to 23653)
Layer 40: 1641 numbers (23654 to 25294)
Layer 41: 1701 numbers (25295 to 26995)
Layer 42: 1761 numbers (26996 to 28756)
Layer 43: 1821 numbers (28757 to 30577)
Layer 44: 1881 numbers (30578 to 32458)
Layer 45: 1941 numbers (32459 to 34399)
Layer 46: 2001 numbers (34400 to 36400)

We can see that 2026 falls within the 46th layer (34400 to 36400). Now we need to find the exact position of 2026 within this layer.

2026 is the 626th number in the 46th layer (since 34400 + 626 = 35026). The 626th number is located near the end of the layer, in the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now, let's find the 8 neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is near the end of the layer, some of its neighbors will be in the next layer, and some will be in the previous layer.

The neighbors are as follows:

1. The number to the left (in the same layer): 2025
2. The number to the right (in the next layer): 2027
3. The number above (in the previous layer): 2024
4. The number below (in the same layer): 2028
5. The number to the upper left (in the previous layer): 2023
6. The number to the upper right (in the next layer): 2029
7. The number to the lower left (in the same layer): 2027
8. The number to the lower right (in the next layer): 2030

Now, let's sum these neighbors:

2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2027 + 2030 = 16143

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16143.
