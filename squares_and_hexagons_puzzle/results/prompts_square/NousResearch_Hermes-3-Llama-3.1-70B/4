To solve this, we need to determine the pattern of the spiral and then find the location of the number 2026. Once we know where 2026 is, we can find its neighbors and sum them up.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The pattern of numbers in the spiral is as follows:

1. The first ring (just the number 1) has 1 number.
2. The second ring (numbers 2 to 9) has 8 numbers.
3. The third ring (numbers 10 to 25) has 16 numbers.
4. The fourth ring (numbers 26 to 49) has 24 numbers.
5. And so on, with each ring having 8 more numbers than the previous one.

Let's find out in which ring the number 2026 is located.

1. The first ring ends at 1.
2. The second ring ends at 1 + 8 = 9.
3. The third ring ends at 9 + 16 = 25.
4. The fourth ring ends at 25 + 24 = 49.
5. The fifth ring ends at 49 + 32 = 81.
6. The sixth ring ends at 81 + 40 = 121.
7. The seventh ring ends at 121 + 48 = 169.
8. The eighth ring ends at 169 + 56 = 225.
9. The ninth ring ends at 225 + 64 = 289.
10. The tenth ring ends at 289 + 72 = 361.
11. The eleventh ring ends at 361 + 80 = 441.
12. The twelfth ring ends at 441 + 88 = 529.
13. The thirteenth ring ends at 529 + 96 = 625.
14. The fourteenth ring ends at 625 + 104 = 729.
15. The fifteenth ring ends at 729 + 112 = 841.
16. The sixteenth ring ends at 841 + 120 = 961.
17. The seventeenth ring ends at 961 + 128 = 1089.
18. The eighteenth ring ends at 1089 + 136 = 1225.
19. The nineteenth ring ends at 1225 + 144 = 1369.
20. The twentieth ring ends at 1369 + 152 = 1521.
21. The twenty-first ring ends at 1521 + 160 = 1681.
22. The twenty-second ring ends at 1681 + 168 = 1849.
23. The twenty-third ring ends at 1849 + 176 = 2025.

Since 2026 is greater than 2025, it must be in the twenty-fourth ring, which starts at 2026 and ends at 2026 + 184 = 2210.

Now, let's find the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is the first number in the twenty-fourth ring, its neighbors will be the last number in the twenty-third ring (2025), the number above it in the twenty-third ring (2024), and the six numbers that follow it in the twenty-fourth ring (2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032). The sum of these neighbors is:

2024 + 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 = 16196

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16,196.
