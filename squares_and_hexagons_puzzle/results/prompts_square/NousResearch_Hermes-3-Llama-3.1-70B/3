To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how the numbers are placed in the grid. The given grid shows the starting pattern:

```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```

From this, we can see that the spiral starts at 1 and moves clockwise, increasing by 1 with each step. To find the position of 2026, we need to determine how many turns the spiral has made and where 2026 would be located in the grid.

First, let's find out how many numbers are in each complete turn of the spiral. The first turn has 9 numbers (1 to 9), the second turn has 16 numbers (10 to 25), and so on. Each subsequent turn adds 8 more numbers than the previous turn because each turn requires one more number on each side of the square.

The number of numbers in each turn follows the sequence: 9, 16, 25, 36, ... which is a sequence of odd squares (1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, ...).

To find the turn in which 2026 is located, we can sum the numbers in each turn until we exceed 2026. Let's calculate the cumulative sums:

1st turn: 9 (1^2)
2nd turn: 9 + 16 = 25 (1^2 + 3^2)
3rd turn: 25 + 25 = 50 (1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2)
4th turn: 50 + 36 = 86 (1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2)
...

We continue this process until the cumulative sum exceeds 2026. However, manually calculating this would be time-consuming, so we can use a more efficient method to find the turn and the position within that turn.

Let's find the largest odd square less than or equal to 2026. We can do this by finding the square root of 2026 and then finding the largest odd number less than or equal to that square root.

The square root of 2026 is approximately 45.01. The largest odd number less than or equal to 45 is 45 itself. So, the largest odd square less than or equal to 2026 is 45^2, which is 2025.

This means that 2026 is in the turn immediately following the one that ends with 2025. The sum of the numbers up to the end of the turn that ends with 2025 is 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + ... + 45^2.

Now, we need to find the position of 2026 within its turn. Since 2026 is the first number in the new turn, it is located at the corner of the spiral. The neighbors of a corner number in the spiral are the numbers that come before and after it in the spiral, as well as the numbers that are diagonally adjacent to it.

Since 2026 is the first number in its turn, the previous number is 2025, and the next number is 2027. The two numbers diagonally adjacent to 2026 would be the last number of the previous turn (2025) and the first number of the next turn after 2026 (2027).

However, we need to consider that the spiral grid wraps around, so the neighbors of 2026 could include numbers from the previous turn. To find the exact neighbors, we would need to know the exact layout of the spiral at the point where 2026 is located.

Since the exact layout of the spiral is not given, and calculating it would be complex without additional information, we cannot determine the exact sum of the neighbors of 2026.
