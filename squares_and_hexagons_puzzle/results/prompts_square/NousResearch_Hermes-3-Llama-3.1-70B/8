To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the pattern of the spiral to locate the position of 2026. The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction.

Let's break down the spiral pattern:

1. The first ring (1 to 9) has 8 perimeter numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
2. The second ring (10 to 25) has 12 perimeter numbers (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22).
3. The third ring (26 to 49) has 16 perimeter numbers (26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41).
4. And so on, with each subsequent ring having 4 more perimeter numbers than the previous ring.

We can see that the number of perimeter numbers in each ring follows an arithmetic sequence starting with 8 and having a common difference of 4.

To find which ring 2026 is in, we can calculate the sum of the perimeter numbers in each ring until we exceed 2026. We can also find the starting number of each ring.

1. Ring 1: 1 to 9 (8 perimeter numbers)
2. Ring 2: 10 to 25 (12 perimeter numbers)
3. Ring 3: 26 to 49 (16 perimeter numbers)
4. Ring 4: 50 to 81 (20 perimeter numbers)
5. Ring 5: 82 to 121 (24 perimeter numbers)
6. Ring 6: 122 to 169 (28 perimeter numbers)
7. Ring 7: 170 to 225 (32 perimeter numbers)
8. Ring 8: 226 to 289 (36 perimeter numbers)
9. Ring 9: 290 to 361 (40 perimeter numbers)
10. Ring 10: 362 to 441 (44 perimeter numbers)
11. Ring 11: 442 to 529 (48 perimeter numbers)
12. Ring 12: 530 to 625 (52 perimeter numbers)
13. Ring 13: 626 to 729 (56 perimeter numbers)
14. Ring 14: 730 to 841 (60 perimeter numbers)
15. Ring 15: 842 to 961 (64 perimeter numbers)
16. Ring 16: 962 to 1089 (68 perimeter numbers)
17. Ring 17: 1090 to 1225 (72 perimeter numbers)
18. Ring 18: 1226 to 1369 (76 perimeter numbers)
19. Ring 19: 1370 to 1521 (80 perimeter numbers)
20. Ring 20: 1522 to 1681 (84 perimeter numbers)
21. Ring 21: 1682 to 1849 (88 perimeter numbers)
22. Ring 22: 1850 to 2025 (92 perimeter numbers)
23. Ring 23: 2026 to 2209 (96 perimeter numbers)

2026 is the first number in ring 23. Now, we need to find its neighbors. Since it's the first number in the ring, it's at a corner, and its neighbors will include the last number of the previous ring (2025) and the next two numbers in the current ring (2027 and 2028). The other neighbors will be the numbers diagonally adjacent to it, which will be in the previous ring.

The neighbors of 2026 are:
- 2025 (previous ring)
- 2027 (next in the current ring)
- 2028 (next in the current ring)
- 2029 (diagonally adjacent in the current ring)
- 2019 (diagonally adjacent in the previous ring)
- 2015 (diagonally adjacent in the previous ring)
- 2011 (diagonally adjacent in the previous ring)
- 2007 (diagonally adjacent in the previous ring)

Now, let's sum these neighbors:
2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2029 + 2019 + 2015 + 2011 + 2007 = 16061

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16061.
