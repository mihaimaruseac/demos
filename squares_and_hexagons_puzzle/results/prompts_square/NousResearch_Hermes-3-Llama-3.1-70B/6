To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the pattern of the spiral and locate the position of 2026.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The pattern of the numbers in the spiral is as follows:

1. The first ring (1 to 9) has 8 neighbors.
2. The second ring (10 to 25) has 8 neighbors for the corner numbers, 7 neighbors for the edge numbers excluding corners, and 5 neighbors for the inner numbers.
3. The third ring (26 to 49) and beyond follow a similar pattern.

To find the position of 2026, we need to determine which ring it is in. We can do this by finding the largest perfect square less than or equal to 2026. The largest perfect square less than 2026 is 2025 (45^2), which means 2026 is in the 45th ring.

Each ring has 8 corner numbers, and since 2026 is a corner number, it will have 8 neighbors. The corner numbers in the spiral are always the perfect squares. Since 2026 is the first number in the 45th ring, the previous corner number (the last number in the 44th ring) is 2025 (45^2). The next corner number (the second number in the 45th ring) is 2027.

Now, let's find the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is a corner number, its neighbors will include the numbers in the previous ring (the 44th ring) and the numbers in the current ring (the 45th ring). The neighbors are as follows:

1. The number directly above 2026 (in the 44th ring): 2025 - 45 = 1980
2. The number to the upper right of 2026 (in the 44th ring): 1980 + 1 = 1981
3. The number to the right of 2026 (in the 45th ring): 2027
4. The number to the lower right of 2026 (in the 45th ring): 2027 + 45 = 2072
5. The number directly below 2026 (in the 45th ring): 2072 + 1 = 2073
6. The number to the lower left of 2026 (in the 45th ring): 2073 + 45 = 2118
7. The number to the left of 2026 (in the 44th ring): 2025 - 1 = 2024
8. The number to the upper left of 2026 (in the 44th ring): 2024 - 45 = 1979

Now, let's sum these neighbors:

1980 + 1981 + 2027 + 2072 + 2073 + 2118 + 2024 + 1979 = 15954

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 15954.
