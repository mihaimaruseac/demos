To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the pattern of the spiral to locate the position of 2026.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The numbers on the edges of each spiral layer form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. The corners of each layer are the squares of odd numbers starting from 1^2.

Let's find the layer in which 2026 is located.

Layer 1: 1 to 1^2 (1)
Layer 2: 2 to 3^2 (9)
Layer 3: 10 to 5^2 (25)
Layer 4: 26 to 7^2 (49)
Layer 5: 50 to 9^2 (81)
Layer 6: 82 to 11^2 (121)
Layer 7: 122 to 13^2 (169)
Layer 8: 170 to 15^2 (225)
Layer 9: 226 to 17^2 (289)
Layer 10: 290 to 19^2 (361)
Layer 11: 362 to 21^2 (441)
Layer 12: 442 to 23^2 (529)
Layer 13: 530 to 25^2 (625)
Layer 14: 626 to 27^2 (729)
Layer 15: 730 to 29^2 (841)
Layer 16: 842 to 31^2 (961)
Layer 17: 962 to 33^2 (1089)
Layer 18: 1090 to 35^2 (1225)
Layer 19: 1226 to 37^2 (1369)
Layer 20: 1370 to 39^2 (1521)
Layer 21: 1522 to 41^2 (1681)
Layer 22: 1682 to 43^2 (1849)
Layer 23: 1850 to 45^2 (2025)
Layer 24: 2026 to 47^2 (2209)

2026 is located in the 24th layer. It is the first number in this layer, which means it is at the bottom-right corner of the spiral.

The 8 neighbors of 2026 would be the numbers surrounding it in the spiral. Since 2026 is at the corner, it will have 3 neighbors from the previous layer (2025, 2024, 2023), 1 neighbor from the same layer (2027), and 4 neighbors from the next layer. However, since we don't have the next layer's numbers, we can only calculate the sum of the 5 neighbors we know.

The sum of the known neighbors is:
2025 (top-left) + 2024 (top) + 2023 (top-right) + 2027 (right) = 2025 + 2024 + 2023 + 2027 = 8099

Without the 4 neighbors from the next layer, we cannot determine the complete sum of all 8 neighbors.
