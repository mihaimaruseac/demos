To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the pattern of the spiral and locate the position of 2026.

The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. The pattern of numbers added to each subsequent layer of the spiral is as follows:

- After 1, we add 2, 3, 4 (4 numbers)
- After 4, we add 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (6 numbers)
- After 9, we add 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (8 numbers)
- After 16, we add 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (10 numbers)
- And so on, increasing by 2 each time.

We can see that the numbers added in each layer form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. The number of terms in each layer increases by 2 each time.

Let's find out in which layer 2026 is located:

1. The first layer has 1 number (1).
2. The second layer has 4 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), summing up to 5.
3. The third layer has 6 numbers (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), summing up to 11.
4. The fourth layer has 8 numbers (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19), summing up to 19.
5. The fifth layer has 10 numbers (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29), summing up to 29.

We continue this process until we find the layer containing 2026. We can calculate the sum of numbers in each layer and subtract it from 2026 to find the position within the layer.

After calculating the sums for each layer, we find that 2026 is in the 17th layer of the spiral. The sum of the numbers in the 16th layer is 1296, and the sum of the numbers in the 17th layer is 2025. Since 2026 - 1296 = 730, we know that 2026 is the 730th number in the 17th layer.

Now, we need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in the spiral, including the numbers in the previous and next layers.

Since 2026 is the last number in the 17th layer, its neighbors will include the last number of the 16th layer (1296), the first number of the 18th layer (2027), and the six numbers that are adjacent to 2026 in the spiral (2025, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, and 2032).

The sum of these 8 neighbors is:
1296 + 2027 + 2025 + 2028 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 + 2032 = 16198

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16198.
