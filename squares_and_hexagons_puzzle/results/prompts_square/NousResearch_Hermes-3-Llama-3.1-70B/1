To solve this, we need to understand the pattern of the spiral and how it progresses. The spiral starts at 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction. Each new spiral layer starts with the next odd square number (1, 9, 25, 49, etc.) and ends with the next even square number (4, 16, 36, 64, etc.).

Let's find the position of 2026 in the spiral:

1. The nth odd square number is given by \( (2n-1)^2 \). We need to find the value of n such that \( (2n-1)^2 \) is just less than or equal to 2026.
2. We can estimate n by taking the square root of 2026, which is approximately 45. Therefore, we start with \( n = 45 \) and check if \( (2 \cdot 45 - 1)^2 \) is less than or equal to 2026.

\( (2 \cdot 45 - 1)^2 = 89^2 = 7921 \), which is greater than 2026, so we've gone too far. Let's try \( n = 44 \):

\( (2 \cdot 44 - 1)^2 = 87^2 = 7569 \), which is still greater than 2026. We continue this process until we find the correct n.

\( (2 \cdot 43 - 1)^2 = 85^2 = 7225 \), which is less than 2026. So, 2026 is in the 43rd spiral layer.

The 43rd spiral layer starts with \( 7225 = 85^2 \) and ends with \( 84^2 = 7056 \). The difference between 7225 and 2026 is 7225 - 2026 = 5199. Since each side of the square spiral has 84 numbers, we can determine the position of 2026 by dividing 5199 by 84.

\( 5199 \div 84 = 61.893 \ldots \) Since we can't have a fraction of a position, we know that 2026 is the 62nd number in the 43rd layer after 7225. This means 2026 is located one position before the end of the bottom side of the 43rd layer.

Now, to find the sum of the 8 neighbors, we need to consider the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) in the spiral. Since 2026 is near the corner of the spiral, some of its neighbors will be on the previous layer, and some will be on the same layer.

The neighbors of 2026 will be:
- The number to the left on the same layer (2025)
- The number above that (2024)
- The number to the right on the same layer (2027)
- The number below that (2028)
- The number diagonally up-left (2023)
- The number diagonally up-right (2029)
- The number diagonally down-left (2030)
- The number diagonally down-right (2031)

Now, we simply add these numbers together to find the sum of the 8 neighbors:

\( 2025 + 2024 + 2027 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2030 + 2031 = 16167 \)

So, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16167.
