To find the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026, we first need to determine the coordinates of 2026 on the spiral square grid. The spiral starts at the center with the number 1 and spirals outward in a clockwise direction.

Let's find the position of 2026:

1. The first spiral (1 to 9) has 9 numbers.
2. The second spiral (10 to 25) has 16 numbers.
3. The third spiral (26 to 49) has 25 numbers.
4. Continuing this pattern, we see that each new spiral adds an additional 8 numbers to the previous spiral's count.

We can calculate the number of numbers in each spiral by using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2, and then subtracting the sum of the previous spiral.

For the first spiral:
Sum = 9(9+1)/2 = 9*10/2 = 45

For the second spiral:
Sum = 16(16+1)/2 = 16*17/2 = 136

For the third spiral:
Sum = 25(25+1)/2 = 25*26/2 = 325

We continue this process until we find the spiral that contains the number 2026.

Let's find the spiral that contains 2026:

1. The first spiral ends at 9.
2. The second spiral ends at 25.
3. The third spiral ends at 49.
4. The fourth spiral ends at 81.
5. The fifth spiral ends at 121.
6. The sixth spiral ends at 169.
7. The seventh spiral ends at 225.
8. The eighth spiral ends at 289.
9. The ninth spiral ends at 361.
10. The tenth spiral ends at 441.
11. The eleventh spiral ends at 529.
12. The twelfth spiral ends at 625.
13. The thirteenth spiral ends at 729.
14. The fourteenth spiral ends at 841.
15. The fifteenth spiral ends at 961.
16. The sixteenth spiral ends at 1089.
17. The seventeenth spiral ends at 1225.
18. The eighteenth spiral ends at 1369.
19. The nineteenth spiral ends at 1521.
20. The twentieth spiral ends at 1681.
21. The twenty-first spiral ends at 1849.
22. The twenty-second spiral ends at 2025.

Since 2026 is greater than 1849 and less than or equal to 2025, it is in the twenty-second spiral.

Now, we need to find the exact position of 2026 within the twenty-second spiral. We know that the twenty-second spiral starts at 1850 and ends at 2025. So, the position of 2026 within this spiral is:

2026 - 1849 = 177

The twenty-second spiral is the 8th spiral out from the center (since each spiral adds 8 more numbers than the previous one), so the width of the square at this point is 8*2+1 = 17 (since the first spiral is 3x3, and each subsequent spiral adds 2 to the length of each side).

Now, we can determine the coordinates of 2026 by counting its position from the start of the spiral. The spiral starts at the bottom right corner of the square, goes up the right side, then goes left along the top, down the left side, and finally right along the bottom before going back up to the center. 

Since the width of the square is 17, the right side of the square will have 17 numbers (1850 to 1866), the top side will have 17-1 = 16 numbers (1867 to 1882), the left side will have 17-1 = 16 numbers (1883 to 1898), and the bottom side will have 16 numbers (1899 to 1914). The remaining numbers will be on the inner sides of the square.

2026 is the 177th number in the spiral, so we count along the sides:

- Right side: 17 numbers (1850 to 1866)
- Top side: 16 numbers (1867 to 1882)
- Left side: 16 numbers (1883 to 1898)
- Bottom side: 16 numbers (1899 to 1914)

We've used up 17 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 65 numbers, so we have 177 - 65 = 112 numbers left to count.

The remaining numbers will be on the inner sides of the square:

- Right inner side: 15 numbers (1915 to 1929)
- Top inner side: 14 numbers (1930 to 1943)
- Left inner side: 14 numbers (1944 to 1957)
- Bottom inner side: 14 numbers (1958 to 1971)

We've used up another 15 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 57 numbers, so we have 112 - 57 = 55 numbers left to count.

The remaining numbers will be on the next inner sides of the square:

- Right inner side: 13 numbers (1972 to 1984)
- Top inner side: 12 numbers (1985 to 1996)
- Left inner side: 12 numbers (1997 to 2008)
- Bottom inner side: 12 numbers (2009 to 2020)

We've used up another 13 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 49 numbers, so we have 55 - 49 = 6 numbers left to count.

The remaining 6 numbers will be on the final inner right side of the square:

- Right inner side: 6 numbers (2021 to 2026)

So, 2026 is the 6th number on the inner right side of the twenty-second spiral. The coordinates of 2026 will be (x, y) where x is the distance from the center of the grid and y is the distance from the bottom of the grid. Since the width of the square is 17, the center is at (8, 8). The coordinates of 2026 will be (8+6-1, 8) = (13, 8) because we subtract 1 to account for the fact that the spiral has an odd width.

Now, we need to find the 8 neighbors of 2026. The neighbors are the numbers directly adjacent to 2026 in all directions (up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonals). Since we know the coordinates of 2026, we can find the coordinates of its neighbors by adding or subtracting 1 from the x and y values:

- Top: (13, 9)
- Bottom: (13, 7)
- Left: (12, 8)
- Right: (14, 8)
- Top-Left: (12, 9)
- Top-Right: (14, 9)
- Bottom-Left: (12, 7)
- Bottom-Right: (14, 7)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these coordinates. Since the spiral is clockwise, the numbers will increase as we move around the spiral. We can find the numbers by counting from 2026 in the appropriate direction:

- Top: 2027
- Bottom: 2025
- Left: 2024
- Right: 2028
- Top-Left: 2023
- Top-Right: 2029
- Bottom-Left: 2022
- Bottom-Right: 2030

Finally, we sum these numbers to find the sum of all 8 neighbors:

2027 + 2025 + 2024 + 2028 + 2023 + 2029 + 2022 + 2030 = 16208

Therefore, the sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16208.
