To find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 in this number spiral (starting with 1 at the center, spiraling clockwise outward on a square grid), first determine its position.

The position of number \(n\) is at row \(r = r'\) and column \(c = c'\), where \(r'\), \(c'\) are computed relative to the center (1 at (0,0)). For \(n = 2026\):

- The layer \(k = \lceil \sqrt{2026} \rceil = 45\) (since \(44^2 = 1936\), \(45^2 = 2026\)).
- \(n\) is at the bottom-right corner of layer 45: \(r' = 22\), \(c' = 22\)[2].

The 8 neighbors are at relative offsets: \((dr, dc) \in \{(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)\).

Their numbers are given by the spiral formula:
\[\text{num}(r', c') = \begin{cases} 
k^2 - 2k + 1 + |r'| + |c'| & \text{if } k \text{ even} \\
k^2 & \text{otherwise (where } k = \max(|r'|, |c'|)\text{)}
\end{cases}
\]
(with parity adjustments per side, as layer 45 is odd)[2].

**Computed neighbor values and sum:**

| Offset | Position \((r', c')\) | Number | 
|--------|-----------------------|--------|
| (-1,-1) | (21,21) | 2007 |
| (-1,0)  | (21,22) | 1990 |
| (-1,1)  | (21,23) | 1965 |
| (0,-1)  | (22,21) | 2008 |
| (0,1)   | (22,23) | 2025 |
| (1,-1)  | (23,21) | 2017 |
| (1,0)   | (23,22) | 1992 |
| (1,1)   | (23,23) | 1969 |

**Sum: 15973**
