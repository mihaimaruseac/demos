16952

Sketch:
- In this spiral, odd squares are at bottom-right corners: 45^2 = 2025 is at (22, −22), so 2026 is at (23, −22).
- Its eight neighbors’ coordinates and values are:
  (22, −23)=2208, (23, −23)=2209, (24, −23)=2210,
  (22, −22)=2025, (24, −22)=2211,
  (22, −21)=1850, (23, −21)=2027, (24, −21)=2212.
- Sum = 2208+2209+2210+2025+2211+1850+2027+2212 = 16952.
