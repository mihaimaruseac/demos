16952

Reasoning (sketch):
- 45^2 = 2025 is at (22, −22); thus 2026 is at (23, −22).
- Ring r has max m = (2r+1)^2 at (r, −r). For a point on ring r:
  - bottom: y = −r → n = m − (r − x)
  - left: x = −r → n = m − 2r − (r + y)
  - top: y = r → n = m − 4r − (r + x)
  - right: x = r → n = m − 6r − (r − y)
- Using r = 22, 23, 24 where needed, the 8 neighbors around (23, −22) are:
  2208, 2209, 2210, 2025, 2211, 1850, 2027, 2212
- Their sum is 16952.
