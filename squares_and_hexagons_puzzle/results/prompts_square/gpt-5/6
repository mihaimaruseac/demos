16952

Reason (sketch):
- The spiral has odd squares at the SE corners. So 45^2 = 2025 is SE of the 45-ring, and 47^2 = 2209 is SE of the 47-ring.
- Since 2026 = 2025 + 1, it is the first step into the 47-ring, at the position just to the right of 2025 and one above the bottom edge.
- Its eight neighbors are:
  - On the 47- and 49-rings near the SE corner: 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212
  - On the 47-ring: 2027 (north)
  - On the 45-ring: 2025 (west), and 1850 (the right side one-above-bottom of the 45-ring; equals 45^2 − [6·22 + 43] = 2025 − 175 = 1850)
- Sum: 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 2027 + 2025 + 1850 = 16952.
