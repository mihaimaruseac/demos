Let the spiral be laid out as described.
The spiral starts with 1 at the center.
The numbers are arranged in layers.
The first layer contains 1 number: 1
The second layer contains 8 numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The third layer contains 16 numbers: 10, 11, ..., 25
The fourth layer contains 24 numbers: 26, ..., 49
The $n$th layer contains $8(n-1)$ numbers.
The number of numbers in the first $n$ layers is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^n 8(i-1) = 1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = 1 + 8 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 4n(n-1) = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 = (2n-1)^2$.
We are looking for the layer that contains 2026.
We need to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \geq 2026$.
$2n-1 \geq \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$
$2n \geq 46.01$
$n \geq 23.005$
So, $n=24$.
The number of numbers in the first 23 layers is $(2(23)-1)^2 = (46-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
Thus, 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer.
We can determine the coordinates of 2026.
Since the spiral grows outwards from the center, we can think of the coordinates as $(x, y)$ starting at $(0,0)$ for 1.
In the $n$th layer, we have $(2n-1)^2$ numbers.
The 24th layer has $48^2 - 45^2 = 2304 - 2025 = 279$ numbers.
The first 23 layers contain 2025 numbers. So 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer.
The position of 2026 can be found by considering the layers.
Let the center be $(0, 0)$. The coordinates of the numbers are given by the following:
$1 \rightarrow (0, 0)$
$2 \rightarrow (1, 0)$
$3 \rightarrow (1, 1)$
$4 \rightarrow (0, 1)$
$5 \rightarrow (-1, 1)$
$6 \rightarrow (-1, 0)$
$7 \rightarrow (-1, -1)$
$8 \rightarrow (0, -1)$
$9 \rightarrow (1, -1)$
For the $n$th layer, the side length is $2n-1$.
The coordinates of 2026 are $(12, 12)$.
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2024, 2028, 2023, 2029, 2022, 2030.
However, we need to find the precise location of 2026.

Let's consider the coordinates. The center is $(0, 0)$.
The numbers in the first layer are (0, 0).
The numbers in the second layer are (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1), (0, -1), (1, -1).
The side length of the $n$th layer is $2n-1$. The $n$th layer starts at $(n-1, n-1)$ and ends at $(-n+1, -n+1)$.
The numbers in the 24th layer are from 2026 to 2304.
The side length of the 24th layer is $2(24)-1 = 47$.
Since 2026 is the first number in the 24th layer, it is at $(23, 23)$.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
(23+1, 23) = (24, 23) = 2027
(23, 23+1) = (23, 24) = 2028
(23-1, 23) = (22, 23) = 2025
(23, 23-1) = (23, 22) = 2024
(23+1, 23+1) = (24, 24) = 2029
(23-1, 23+1) = (22, 24)
(23+1, 23-1) = (24, 22)
(23-1, 23-1) = (22, 22)
Sum of neighbors: 2025 + 2027 + 2024 + 2028 + 2029 + ...
$2026-1+2026+1+2026-x+2026+x = 4(2026) = 8104$.

Since 2025 is $(22, 23, 24)$, after 2025 there are 2026, so it is wrong.
In the 24th layer, the coordinates start at (23, 23), and the 279th number is $(23+(n-1), 23-)$, which isn't right.

2026 is in the 24th layer. The size of the layer is 48.
The numbers are 2026, ...
We have 2025 numbers in layers 1-23. The next number is 2026.
The side is 2n-1. 2n-1 = 47.
So the side is 47.
The position of 2026 is the first number.
The coordinates of 2026 is (12, 12). No.

The 23rd square has 2025 numbers. Size $(2 \times 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
Sum of the neighbors = $4(2026) = 8104$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{8104}$
