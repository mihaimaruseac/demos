Let the spiral be laid out on a square grid as follows:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
The numbers are written in a spiral starting from 1. The spiral is centered at 1. We need to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

The numbers are arranged in concentric squares, like layers of an onion. The size of the square increases as the numbers get larger.

Let's find the layer where 2026 is located. Let $n$ be the number of layers.
The number of elements in the $n$th layer is $8n$. The last element in the $n$th layer is $1 + \sum_{i=1}^n 8i = 1 + 8 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 4n(n+1) = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n+1)^2$.
We need to find $n$ such that $(2n+1)^2 \ge 2026$.
$2n+1 \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$. So $2n \ge 44$, which means $n \ge 22$.
The last number in the 22nd layer is $(2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
So 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer.

Since 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, its position is $(23+1)/2 = 12$ on one side of the center, and $(23+1)/2 = 12$ on the other side.
Let's assume 1 is at the center of the grid.
The numbers are written in the following order:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
The number 2025 is at the corner of the square. The next number, 2026, is to the right of 2025.
The coordinates of 1 are (0,0). The coordinates of 2025 are (11, -11). Thus, the coordinates of 2026 are (12, -11).

The 8 neighbors of 2026 are:
(11, -11), (11, -10), (12, -10), (13, -11), (13, -10), (13, -12), (12, -12), (11, -12).

We need to find the values of these 8 neighbors.
The coordinates of 2025 are (11, -11), which means the value is 2025.
Since we know the layout of the numbers, we can find the numbers around 2025 and 2026.
2025 is in the 22nd layer. 2026 is in the 23rd layer.
2025, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, ... are the numbers in the 22nd layer.
The coordinates of 2026 are (12, -11).
The next numbers are 2027, 2028, ...
The values of the neighbors of 2026 are:
(11, -11) = 2025
(11, -10) = 2027
(12, -10) = 2028
(13, -11) = 2023
(13, -10) = 2022
(13, -12) = 2019
(12, -12) = 2018
(11, -12) = 2017
Sum = 2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2023 + 2022 + 2019 + 2018 + 2017 = 16279

Since the number 2026 is the first number in the 23rd layer, the numbers in the 23rd layer are 2026, 2027, 2028, ...
Let's consider 2025. The neighbors are 2024, 2023, 2017, 2018, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014.
2025 = $45^2$. Since $2026 = 45^2 + 1$, the neighbors of 2026 are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2023, 2022, 2019, 2018, 2017.
Sum = $2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2023 + 2022 + 2019 + 2018 + 2017 = 16279$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16279}$
