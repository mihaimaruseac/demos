Let the spiral start at 1 in the center. Then the spiral is:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21
22 23 24 25 26 27 28
29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
...

The numbers in the spiral can be written as:
1
2, 3
4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9, 10
11, 12, 13, 14, 15
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
...

The number 1 is at the center (0, 0).
The number 2 is at (0, 1).
The number 3 is at (1, 1).
The number 4 is at (1, 0).
The number 5 is at (1, -1).
The number 6 is at (0, -1).
The number 7 is at (-1, -1).
The number 8 is at (-1, 0).
The number 9 is at (-1, 1).

In general, the $n$-th square has $(2n-1)^2$ elements.
$1^2 = 1$
$3^2 = 9$
$5^2 = 25$
$7^2 = 49$
$9^2 = 81$
$11^2 = 121$
$13^2 = 169$
$15^2 = 225$
$17^2 = 289$
$19^2 = 361$
$21^2 = 441$
$23^2 = 529$
$25^2 = 625$
$27^2 = 729$
$29^2 = 841$
$31^2 = 961$
$33^2 = 1089$
$35^2 = 1225$
$37^2 = 1369$
$39^2 = 1521$
$41^2 = 1681$
$43^2 = 1849$
$45^2 = 2025$
$47^2 = 2209$

Since $45^2 = 2025$ and $47^2 = 2209$, the number 2026 is in the square $46 \times 46$.
The side of the square is $2(45)+1 = 91$.
The center is at $(0,0)$. The number 2025 is at $(0,0)$.
Since $2026 = 2025 + 1$, 2026 is close to 2025.

In the spiral, 2025 is at the center of the $91 \times 91$ square.
So 2025 is at the coordinates $(0, 0)$.
2026 is one step away from 2025.
We need to find the neighbors of 2026.

If the position of $n$ is $(x, y)$, the neighbors are $(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y+1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1)$.

We know that 2025 is at the center of the $91 \times 91$ square.
The coordinates of 2025 are $(0, 0)$.
The 2026 is the next number in the spiral. We can find its coordinate.
When $n=1$, $(x, y)=(0, 0)$.
When $n=2$, $(x, y)=(0, 1)$.
When $n=3$, $(x, y)=(1, 1)$.
When $n=4$, $(x, y)=(1, 0)$.
When $n=5$, $(x, y)=(1, -1)$.
...

$45^2 = 2025$
$46^2 = 2116$
$2026$ is in the $46th$ square.
The sides of the square are $2(45)+1 = 91$.
The side length is $2n-1$.
The equation of the spiral is $n = (k-1)^2 + k$.

We can write $2026 = 2025 + 1 = 45^2 + 1$.
2025 is at the center.
Going counterclockwise from the center:
The numbers are 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, ...
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, ...
Since we are looking for 8 neighbors of 2026, we cannot deduce it easily.

Consider the number $2026$. The number $2025 = 45^2$ is at the center.
We can estimate the position of 2026.
Since $45^2 = 2025$ and $46^2 = 2116$, $45^2 < 2026 < 46^2$.
The side length of the square is $2 \cdot 45 + 1 = 91$.

The sum of the 8 neighbors is $2025 + 2027 + ...$.

The eight neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2028, 2024, 2030, 2023, 2029.

The eight neighbors are:
2025, 2027, 2028, 2030, 2024, 2023, 2029, 2031

The sum is $2025 + 2027 + 2028 + 2030 + 2024 + 2023 + 2029 + 2031 = 16227$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16227}$
