Let the grid be such that the number 1 is in the center, and the numbers spiral outwards. The numbers are arranged as follows:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
The sequence of numbers follows a spiral pattern.
The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... are arranged in the spiral.
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026.

Let's find the coordinates of the number 2026 in the grid.
The concentric squares have side lengths 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
The number of integers in a square with side length $2n+1$ is $(2n+1)^2$.
The number of integers in the $n$-th layer (starting from $n=0$) is $(2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = 4n+1$.
The total number of integers in the first $n$ layers is $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (4i+1) = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i + n = 4 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n = 2n(n-1) + n = 2n^2 - 2n + n = 2n^2 - n$.
We want to find $n$ such that $2n^2 - n \le 2026 < 2(n+1)^2 - (n+1)$.
We have $2n^2 - n \approx 2026$, so $2n^2 \approx 2026$, $n^2 \approx 1013$, $n \approx \sqrt{1013} \approx 31.8$.
For $n=31$, we have $2(31)^2 - 31 = 2(961) - 31 = 1922 - 31 = 1891$.
For $n=32$, we have $2(32)^2 - 32 = 2(1024) - 32 = 2048 - 32 = 2016$.
For $n=33$, we have $2(33)^2 - 33 = 2(1089) - 33 = 2178 - 33 = 2145$.
Since $2016 \le 2026 < 2145$, we know that 2026 is in the $32$-nd layer.
The number of elements in the $32$-nd layer is $2(32)^2 - 32 - (2(31)^2 - 31) = 2048 - 32 - (1922 - 31) = 2016 - 1891 = 125$.
Since $2026 - 2016 = 10$, we are in the $10$-th position of this layer.

The numbers in the $n$-th layer are $2n^2-n+1$ to $2n^2-n+4n+1=2n^2+3n+1$.
The $n=32$ layer has numbers from $2(32)^2 - 32 + 1 = 2017$ to $2(32)^2 + 3(32)+1 = 2048+96+1=2145$.
The numbers are arranged in spiral form. The coordinates of 2026 are $(32, 32-9) = (32, 23)$.
The 8 neighbors are:
(31, 23), (33, 23), (32, 22), (32, 24), (31, 22), (31, 24), (33, 22), (33, 24).
The numbers in the positions are:
(31, 23) = $2017 - (32-31) - 1 = 2016$. No!
Trying to position the value 2026:
$2026 = 2n^2 - n + k$ with $1 \le k \le 4n+1$.
$2026 = 2(32^2) - 32 + 10 = 2016 + 10$.
The sides are given by $2n+1$, so $2(32)+1 = 65$.
The coordinates of 2026 are approximately $(0, 0)$.

We have $2026 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

However, let's consider the neighbors of 1: 2, 4, 6, 8. The sum is 20.
Consider the neighbors of 2: 1, 3, 5, 9. The sum is 18.
Observe $2026 = 2025 + 1 = 45^2 + 1$.

The neighbors of 2026 are 2017, 2018, 2025, 2027, 2035, 2034, 2033, 2032.
If we assume the grid is constructed properly, the eight numbers surrounding 2026 are 2017, 2025, 2027, 2035, 2018, 2034, 2033, 2032.
Then the sum is $2017+2025+2027+2035+2018+2034+2033+2032 = 16221$.

Let us consider a small example.
What is the sum of neighbors of 5?
Neighbors: 4, 6, 2, 8. Sum is 20.
Neighbors of 6: 5, 7, 1, 9. Sum is 22.
Neighbors of 7: 6, 8, 2, 10. Sum is 26.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16220}$
