Let the spiral be arranged in a square grid, with the center being the number 1.
The numbers are arranged in a spiral pattern, with the natural numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots$ arranged in a spiral order.
The given spiral is:
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
The center is 1. The layers are:
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5
Layer 3: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number 2026.
Let's determine which layer 2026 is in.
The number of terms in the $n$-th layer is $8n-8$ for $n > 1$.
The total number of terms up to layer $n$ is $1 + \sum_{i=2}^n (8i-8) = 1 + 8 \sum_{i=2}^n (i-1) = 1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = 1 + 8 \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 1 + 4n(n-1) = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 = (2n-1)^2$.
We want to find $n$ such that $(2n-1)^2 \approx 2026$.
$2n-1 \approx \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.0111$.
$2n \approx 46.0111$, so $n \approx 23.0055$.
Let's check $n=23$.
$(2n-1)^2 = (2(23)-1)^2 = (46-1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
So 2025 is the last term in layer 23. The next term is 2026, which is in layer 24.
The last term in layer 23 is 2025, so the terms in layer 24 are 2026, 2027, 2028, ...
Since 2026 is the first term in layer 24, we need to figure out its position in the spiral.
The starting point of layer $n$ is $(2n-1)^2$. The terms in layer $n$ are $2025 + k$ for $k=1, 2, \dots, 8n-8$.
The number 2026 is the first term in layer 24.
Since 2025 is the end of layer 23, the next term is 2026.
The terms in layer 23 are from $45^2 - (8(23)-8) + 1$ to $45^2$, or from $2025 - (184-8)+1 = 2025 - 176 + 1 = 1850$ to $2025$.
The last term in each layer is a perfect square, $(2n-1)^2$.
We want the 8 neighbors of 2026.
Let the center be (0,0). Then the spiral is laid out such that:
1: (0,0)
2: (1,0)
3: (1,1)
4: (0,1)
5: (-1,1)
6: (-1,0)
7: (-1,-1)
8: (0,-1)
9: (1,-1)
When $n=23$, the last term is $45^2=2025$.
When $n=24$, we start at 2026. We can determine the coordinates of 2026.
$2n-1 = 47$. $47^2 = 2209$.
We have $(n,n)$, $(n,-n)$, $(-n,n)$, $(-n,-n)$.
The number 2026 is located close to the edge of the spiral.

Since 2026 is the first term in layer 24, the next terms in layer 24 are 2027, 2028, 2029, ...
The eight neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2034, 2035, 2033, 2032, 2029, 2030.
The sum is $2025 + 2027 + 2034 + 2035 + 2033 + 2032 + 2029 + 2030 = 16245$.

If we consider the neighbors of 2026 in the grid, we have
2025, 2027, 2034, 2033, 2032, 2031, 2030, 2029.
The sum is $2025 + 2027 + 2034 + 2033 + 2032 + 2031 + 2030 + 2029 = 16241$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16241}$
