Let the spiral be arranged as follows:
```
37 36 35 34 33
38 17 16 15 32
39 18  1  2  31
40 19 20 21 30
41 22 23 24 29
```
We want to find the sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 in the spiral.
The given spiral is arranged in layers.
The center is 1.
The next layer has 2, 3, 4, 5 and the numbers increase as we move outwards.
Let $n$ be the number in the spiral.
The number of layers we need to reach 2026.
We can estimate the approximate side length of the square containing the number 2026 by taking the square root of 2026, which is approximately 45.
Let $k$ be the index of the layer such that $1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = n$.
The numbers in the $n$-th layer are from $1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i$ to $1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i + 8n - 1$.
$1 + 8 \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = 1 + 8 \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1 + 4k(k+1)$.
We need to find $k$ such that $1 + 4k(k+1) \le 2026$.
$4k(k+1) \le 2025$
$k(k+1) \le \frac{2025}{4} = 506.25$
If $k=22$, $22(23) = 506$.
So, $1 + 4(22)(23) = 1 + 2024 = 2025$.
The number 2025 is at position $(22, 22)$ from the center (1).
Therefore, the number 2026 is the next number in the spiral.
From 2025 to 2026, we move to the right.
2026 is in the next layer, so the $k=23$ layer.
We have $2026 = 1 + 4(22)(23) + 1 = 1 + 2024 + 1 = 2026$.
So $2026$ is next to 2025.
2025 is on the layer $k=22$, which has $8k=8(22)=176$ numbers in the layer.
The layer $k=23$ has $8k-8 = 8(23)-8 = 184-8 = 176$ numbers in the layer.
We are looking for the neighbors of 2026.
The numbers in the spiral are arranged as follows:
Layer 1: 1
Layer 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Layer 3: 10, 11, ..., 17, 18, 19, ...
The numbers are arranged in a spiral around the center 1.
$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, \dots$
The number 2026 is in the 23rd layer. The number of layers is $k$ such that
$1 + 4k(k+1) \le 2026$.
If $k=22$, then $1 + 4(22)(23) = 1 + 2024 = 2025$.
Thus, $2026$ is the next number after $2025$.
The numbers in the spiral are arranged such that the differences between adjacent terms increase by 1.
The neighbor values are centered around 2026.
The neighbors are:
$2025, 2027, 2026-9 \times 2, 2026-9 \times 2$

2025 is the previous number in the spiral.
2027 is the next number in the spiral.

Consider the case when the numbers are arranged in a square array.
The neighbors of 2026 are:
2025 (left), 2027 (right),
2026 - 45 (up), 2026 + 45 (down),
2026 - 46 (up-left), 2026 - 44 (up-right),
2026 - 46 (down-left), 2026 - 44 (down-right).
The sum is $2025 + 2027 + 2026 - 45 + 2026 + 45 + 2026 - 46 + 2026 + 46 = 5(2026) + 2025 + 2027 = 10130 + 4052 = 14182$.
However, this is for the square grid and the spiral.
$2025 + 2027$ are the neighbors for the next turn.

2025 + 2027 = 4052
The neighbors are $2026 - 1, 2026+1, 2026-45, 2026+45$
Sum is $4052 + 2(2026) = 4052 + 4052 = 8104 + 2026 - 45 + 2026 + 45 = 8104$
The sum of the 8 neighbors of 2026 is $2025 + 2027 + 2010 + 2042 + 1979 + 1981 + 2080 + 2078 = 16222$

The sum of the 8 neighbors is $8 \times 2026 = 16208$.

$2026+2025+2027 = 6078$

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16208}$
