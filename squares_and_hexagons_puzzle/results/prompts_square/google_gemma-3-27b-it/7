Let the spiral be filled with natural numbers in the following way:
```
... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...
```
The numbers are arranged in a spiral manner. We want to find the sum of the neighbors of 2026.

Consider the sequence of numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots$. We can see that they are arranged in layers.
The first layer is 1.
The second layer is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The third layer is 10, 11, ..., 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
Let $n$ be the number of layers. The last number in layer $n$ is $n^2$.
The numbers in the $n$-th layer are from $(n-1)^2+1$ to $n^2$.
We want to find the layer that contains 2026.
$n^2 \ge 2026$
$n \ge \sqrt{2026} \approx 45.01$.
Thus, $n = 46$.
The last number in layer $n=45$ is $45^2 = 2025$. So 2026 is in the 46th layer.
Since $2026 = 45^2 + 1$, it is the first number in the 46th layer.
The 46th layer is arranged as follows:
```
... a b c ...
... d 2026 e ...
... f g h ...
```
The neighbors of 2026 are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.
However, we can use the following pattern to find the neighbors of a number.
The largest number in layer $n$ is $n^2$.
The largest number in layer $n-1$ is $(n-1)^2$.
If a number $x$ is in layer $n$, then $n-1 \le \sqrt{x} < n$.
The neighbors of $x$ are $x-1, x+1, x-n, x+n, x-n-1, x+n-1, x-n+1, x+n+1$.
However, this is not always true.
In this case, $x = 2026$. We want to find the 8 neighbors.
Since 2025 is the last number in layer 45, we have 2026 is in the 46th layer.
Since $2026 = 45^2 + 1$, the number is the first number in the 46th layer.
The numbers in the previous layer are $(n-1)^2+1, \dots, n^2$.
The numbers in layer 45 are $44^2+1 = 1937$ to $45^2 = 2025$.
In layer 45, the numbers are arranged in the following manner:
```
... 1961 1962 1963 ...
... 1964 1965 1966 ...
... 1967 1968 1969 ...
```
The neighboring numbers of 2026 are 2025, 2027. Also, we can consider the numbers where the spiral turns.
The side length of the square containing the number $x$ is $2 \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor - 1$.
The coordinates of the number 2026 are:
$n = 46$, so the side length is $2(46)-1 = 91$.
$2026 = 45^2 + 1$.
We can find the position of 2026 in the spiral.
Since 2026 is the first number in layer 46, it is at the bottom right corner of the spiral.
The position of 2026 is $(45, 45)$ in the grid.
The coordinates are $(x, y) = (45, 45)$.
The neighbors are (44, 45), (46, 45), (45, 44), (45, 46).
We can also find the neighbors by working backward.
The number before 2026 is 2025. Since 2025 is the last number in layer 45, we have 2026's immediate neighbor is 2025.
Consider the coordinates of 2025 = (x, y) = (45, 44).
By moving in the spiral, we can find the neighbors of 2026. Since 2026 is the first element of the layer 46, the neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1969, 2089.
The neighbors are 2025, 2027, 1965+9+40 = 2087, 2088.
The number before 2026 is 2025. The next number is 2027.
Layer 46: 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, ...
The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 1969, and some other numbers.
The sum of neighbors is 2025 + 2027 + 1969 + ...
However, the numbers are arranged in a spiral. The neighbors are 2025, 2027, and the 6 other neighbors in the spiral.
$2026 = 45^2+1$. The coordinates of 2026 are (45, 45).
Neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2027, 2089, 1969.
2025, 2027, 1969, 2089, 2087, 1967, 1971.

The numbers around 2026 are:
2025, 2027,
1969, 2089,
1967, 2091,
1971, 2087.
The sum is 2025+2027+1969+2089+1967+2091+1971+2087 = 16226.
The sum of neighbors of 2026 is 16226-2026.

$2026 = 45^2 + 1$. The layer number is 46.
The numbers around 2026 are $2025, 2027, 1969, 1970 \dots, 1961$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16226}$
