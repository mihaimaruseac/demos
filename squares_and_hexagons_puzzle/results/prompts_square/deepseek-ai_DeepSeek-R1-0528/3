<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand how the spiral is constructed and locate where 2026 is in this spiral.

The spiral starts at the center with 1, then moves right to 2, down to 3, left to 4,5,6? Looking at the given part:

It shows 5,4,3 on top, then 6,1,2 in the middle, and 7,8,9 below. So, probably, it's centered at 1, with 2 to the right, 3 above? No.

Let me sketch this out. Assume the center is 1. Then to the right is 2. Then above 2 should be 3? But in the grid, it shows:

Row above: 5,4,3 — so probably positions: let's define coordinates.

Set the center (where 1 is) as (0,0). Then to the east (right) is (1,0) which is 2. Then the next number should be north? But in the grid, above 1 is 6? No.

Given:

It says: ... 5 4 3 ... so probably this is the top row, but it's incomplete.

From the context, it seems that directly above 1 is 6? Let's see:

The middle row is: ... 6 1 2 ... so if we assume that 1 is at center, then left of 1 is 6? But that doesn't make sense because typically spirals go right, then up, but here it might be different.

Perhaps the spiral is oriented differently. Let me think how spirals usually grow.

Standard Ulam spiral starts at center, goes right, then up, then left, then down, and so on.

But in this representation, it shows:

Positions: let's list the numbers around 1.

From the grid: west of 1 is 6? The row is "6 1 2", so if this is a row, then x-coordinates: let's say column 0 has 1, column 1 has 2, column -1 has 6? Then above, it says "5 4 3", so probably row above, columns -1,0,1 have 5,4,3? But that would mean at (0,1) is 4? But directly above 1 should be at (0,1), but here it's 4? But 4 is not adjacent to 1.

I need to infer the positions.

Assume that the center is (0,0) with value 1.

Then to the east (1,0) is 2.

Then the next number is north? But in the grid, above 1 is not given directly. The row above has 5,4,3. If (0,1) is above 1, and it's 4, then (1,1) is 3, (-1,1) is 5? Then below, "7 8 9", so probably row below: (-1,-1) is 7, (0,-1) is 8, (1,-1) is 9.

But then adjacent to 1: east is 2, north is 4? But 4 is not adjacent; adjacent would be (0,1) which is 4, but in a grid, (0,1) is directly above, so yes, but typically in spiral, after 2, it should go to 3 above 2, not above 1.

Let's see the sequence. From 1, it goes to 2 (east). Then to 3 (north), but if (1,0) is 2, then north of 2 is (1,1), which should be 3. But in the grid, at (1,1) is 3, yes. Then west to 4, which should be (0,1), but in the grid, (0,1) is 4? But above 1 is (0,1), so yes, 4 is at (0,1). Then west to 5, which is (-1,1), which is 5. Then down to 6, which should be (-1,0), but in the grid, west of 1 is 6? The middle row is "6 1 2", so if 1 is at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), then left should be (-1,0), which is 6. But according to spiral, after 5 at (-1,1), it should go down to (-1,0), which is 6, yes. Then down to 7, (-1,-1), which is 7. Then east to 8 (0,-1), and 9 (1,-1).

So the grid is:

At y=1 (top row): x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But in the given, it says "5 4 3", so yes, (-1,1)=5, (0,1)=4, (1,1)=3.

Middle row y=0: (-1,0)=6, (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2.

Bottom row y=-1: (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

But is this correct? Let's see the spiral order: start 1 at (0,0). Move east to (1,0)=2. Then north to (1,1)=3. Then west to (0,1)=4? But (0,1) is directly north of 1, but in spiral, after 2 at (1,0), moving north to (1,1)=3, then west to (0,1)=4, then west to (-1,1)=5. Then south to (-1,0)=6, then south to (-1,-1)=7, then east to (0,-1)=8, then east to (1,-1)=9, then north to (1,0) but that's already occupied, so probably next is north to (2,-1)? But we don't have that.

After 9 at (1,-1), it should go north to (1,0), but that's occupied, so instead, it increases the step size. Standard spiral: after completing a layer, it moves to the next.

From 1, it goes right 1 step to 2. Then up 1 step to 3. Then left 2 steps: to 4 (at (0,1)), then to 5 (at (-1,1)). Then down 2 steps: to 6 (at (-1,0)), then to 7 (at (-1,-1)). Then right 2 steps: to 8 (at (0,-1)), then to 9 (at (1,-1)). Then next, since it's a new layer, it goes up 2 steps: but (1,-1) to (1,0) is occupied, so it goes to (1,0) but that's taken, no, after 9 at (1,-1), it should move up to the next row.

Standard direction: after right, up, left, down, then right again but with larger step.

After down, it should go right again. From (1,-1)=9, move east to (2,-1)=10. Then north to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, and so on.

But in our grid, we have up to 9, so for larger numbers, it extends.

Now, I need to find the position of 2026 in this spiral.

To do that, I need a way to compute the coordinates for a given number n.

Since the spiral is symmetric, I can find which "layer" or "ring" 2026 is in.

Notice that the spiral grows in layers. The center is layer 0, with just 1.

Then layer 1: numbers 2 to 9? 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 8 numbers.

Layer 2: from 10 to 25? Let's see: after 9 at (1,-1), next is 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2)? Then left to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2)? Then down to (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2)? Then right to (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)? Then up to (2,-1), but occupied, so stop.

The size of each layer: layer k (k>=1) has side length 2k+1? For layer k, the numbers on the ring.

The starting number of layer k: for k=0, start at 1.

k=1, start at 2.

k=2, start at 10? 1, then 2 to 9 (8 numbers), then 10 to 25? 25-10+1=16, which is 8*2? 8 numbers for k=1, but k=2 should have more.

The maximum number in layer k: since it's a square, the side length increases.

The numbers are placed in a spiral, so the largest number in each "ring" is a perfect square.

Notice that the bottom-right corner of each layer is an odd square.

For example, at (1,-1) is 9, which is 3^2.

At (2,-2) would be? After layer 1 ends at 9=3^2.

Layer 2: starts at 10, ends at? From above, after 9, to 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25? 25=5^2.

At position (2,-2)? Let's compute.

From (1,-1)=9, move east to (2,-1)=10.

North to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13.

West to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17.

South to (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21.

East to (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25.

Yes, so (2,-2)=25=5^2.

Similarly, layer 1 ended at (1,-1)=9=3^2.

Layer 0 is just (0,0)=1=1^2.

So the ending corners are at (k, -k) for k odd? k=1: (1,-1), k=3: (3,-3)? But 9 is k=3? 3^2, but k=1? Inconsistency.

Set m such that the square is (2m+1) x (2m+1) centered at origin.

For m=0: size 1x1, number 1.

m=1: size 3x3, numbers 1 to 9, with max at corners, but (1,-1)=9.

m=2: size 5x5, numbers 1 to 25, max at (2,-2)=25.

The max number is (2m+1)^2.

For m=0: (1)^2=1, correct.

m=1: 3^2=9, correct.

m=2: 5^2=25, correct.

The layer m consists of all numbers from (2m-1)^2 + 1 to (2m+1)^2.

For m=1: from (2*1 -1)^2 +1 =1^2 +1=2 to 3^2=9, yes.

m=2: from (4-1)^2 +1=9+1=10 to 25, yes.

m=0: from ( -1)^2? Doesn't make sense, so layer m for m>=1.

The center is separate.

Now, for a given n, find which layer it is in.

Find m such that (2m-1)^2 < n <= (2m+1)^2.

For n=2026, find m.

Set k=2m+1, so k is odd, and k^2 >= n, and (k-2)^2 < n.

Since k is odd, let k be the smallest odd integer such that k^2 >= n.

Then m = (k-1)/2.

Compute sqrt(2026). 44^2=1936, 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

45^2=2025, which is less than 2026? 2025 < 2026, so k^2 >= n, 45^2=2025 < 2026, so not >=, so next odd is 47? But 45 is odd, but 45^2=2025 < 2026, so not >= n. Next odd is 47, 47^2=2209 > 2026.

But (k-2)^2 should be less than n. k-2=45? But k=47, k-2=45, 45^2=2025 < 2026, yes.

So k=47, m=(k-1)/2=(47-1)/2=46/2=23.

k=47, m=(k-1)/2=46/2=23.

The layer m=23 has numbers from (2*23 -1)^2 +1 to (2*23 +1)^2 = (46-1)^2 +1? 2m-1=2*23-1=45, so from 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1=2026 to (47)^2=2209.

Exactly, n=2026 is the first number in layer m=23.

So it starts at 2026.

Now, where is this located? In the spiral, each layer starts at a specific position.

For layer m, it starts at the position immediately to the right of the end of the previous layer.

The previous layer ended at the bottom-right corner.

For layer m-1, it ended at (m-1, -(m-1))? Earlier for m=1, ended at (1,-1).

m=2, ended at (2,-2).

So in general, for layer m, it ends at (m, -m).

And since it ends at bottom-right corner, and the next number is to the east, so the start of layer m is at (m, -m +1)? Let's see.

After layer m-1 ends at (m-1, -(m-1)).

For example, m-1=1, ends at (1,-1).

Then next number is to the east, so (2,-1)? But for m=2, it started at (2,-1)=10.

But (2,-1) is x=m, y= -(m-1) ? m=2, y=-1 = -(2-1)? -(m-1).

x=m=2, y= -(m-1) = -1.

But earlier we said it starts at (m, -m +1)? -m +1 = -2+1=-1, same.

-(m-1) = -m +1, yes.

But for layer m, the start is at (m, -(m-1)) = (m, -m +1).

In this case, m=23, so position is (23, -23 +1) = (23, -22).

Now, is this correct? For m=1: start at (1, -1 +1)=(1,0). But earlier for layer m=1, it started at 2, which is at (1,0)? In our initial grid, at (1,0) is 2, yes.

For m=2: start at (2, -2+1)=(2,-1)=10, which matches.

Good.

So for n=2026, it is at (23, -22).

Now, I need to find its eight neighbors. That is, the eight adjacent cells: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.

So positions: (x,y) = (23,-22)

Neighbors:

N: (x,y+1) = (23,-21)

S: (x,y-1) = (23,-23)

E: (x+1,y) = (24,-22)

W: (x-1,y) = (22,-22)

NE: (x+1,y+1) = (24,-21)

NW: (x-1,y+1) = (22,-21)

SE: (x+1,y-1) = (24,-23)

SW: (x-1,y-1) = (22,-23)

Now, I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since the spiral is filled in order, I need to compute the number corresponding to each coordinate.

So I need a function f(x,y) that gives the number at position (x,y).

To find that, I can use the layer information.

Note that each layer m corresponds to a square from x=-m to m, y=-m to m, but excluding inner squares.

The maximum of |x| and |y| determines the layer.

For a point (x,y), the layer m is m = max(|x|, |y|).

For example, (0,0): max(0,0)=0, layer 0.

(1,0): max(1,0)=1, layer 1.

(1,1): max(1,1)=1, layer 1.

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, layer 2, which is correct, since it's in layer m=2.

(2,-2): max(2,2)=2, layer 2.

(3,0): max(3,0)=3, layer 3.

Now, within a layer m, the numbers go from (2m-1)^2 +1 to (2m+1)^2.

The total numbers in layer m: from (2m-1)^2 +1 to (2m+1)^2, so number of elements is (2m+1)^2 - (2m-1)^2 = [4m^2 + 4m +1] - [4m^2 -4m +1] = 8m.

Yes, as we saw earlier, 8m numbers in layer m.

Now, within the layer, the path goes: start at (m, -m+1), then move up to (m, m), then left to (-m, m), then down to (-m, -m), then right to (m, -m).

But not exactly, because it starts at (m, -m+1), and moves north to (m,m), then west to (-m,m), then south to (-m,-m), then east to (m,-m).

But (m,-m) is the end.

Now, the direction: from start (m, -m+1), move north: increasing y, same x.

Until y=m.

Then move west: decreasing x, same y=m.

Until x=-m.

Then move south: decreasing y, same x=-m.

Until y=-m.

Then move east: increasing x, same y=-m.

Until x=m.

But since it ends at (m,-m), and starts at (m,-m+1), so the east move ends at (m,-m).

Now, the length of each segment:

- North: from y=-m+1 to y=m, so number of steps: m - (-m+1) = m + m -1 = 2m -1? Steps: from y=-m+1 to y=m, inclusive? The number of points.

Start at y=-m+1, end at y=m. The y-coordinates: from -m+1 to m, inclusive.

Number of integers: m - (-m+1) + 1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

For example, m=1: y from -1+1=0 to 1? But for m=1, start at (1,0), then move north to (1,1). So y from 0 to 1, two points: (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is start, (1,1) is next. But in the path, it moves from (1,0) to (1,1), so the segment includes both ends? Typically, when moving, it includes the starting point and then moves to new points.

In the north move, it starts at (m, -m+1) and moves to (m,m), so the points covered are from y=-m+1 to y=m, inclusive.

Number of points: m - (-m+1) + 1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

For m=1: y=0 to 1, number: 2, which are (1,0)=2? But in layer m=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3. But total in north segment should include both.

But the start is already included, and it moves to new points.

In this segment, it covers 2m points? For m=1, 2 points: (1,0) and (1,1). But (1,0) is the start of the layer, and it goes to (1,1). Then next is west.

But in layer m=1, total 8 points, but north segment has 2 points? But 2<8.

After north, it moves west to (0,1), etc.

For m=1: points: start (1,0)=2, north to (1,1)=3, then west to (0,1)=4, then west to (-1,1)=5, then south to (-1,0)=6, then south to (-1,-1)=7, then east to (0,-1)=8, then east to (1,-1)=9.

So segments:

- North: from (1,0) to (1,1): two points: 2 and 3? But 2 is start, 3 is new. Actually, the segment includes the starting point and the new points added while moving.

In this case, moving north: starts at (1,0), moves to (1,1), so adds one new point: (1,1). But the start is already counted.

To avoid confusion, when we say "the segment", it includes all points added during that move, excluding the start if it's already placed.

In the path, the start position is already occupied by the first number, then each move adds new positions.

For layer m, it starts at (m, -m+1) with the first number.

Then it moves north: each step increases y by 1, same x, until y=m.

The y-coordinates: from -m+1 to m, but since it starts at y=-m+1, and moves to y=m, it moves a distance of m - (-m+1) = 2m -1? From y=a to y=b, number of moves is |b-a|, but number of new positions is |b-a|.

Start at y=-m+1. Move north: next position is (m, -m+2), then (m,-m+3), ..., up to (m,m).

The y-values: start at y_s = -m+1, end at y_e = m.

The sequence of y: y_s, y_s+1, ..., y_e.

Number of points: y_e - y_s + 1 = m - (-m+1) + 1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

But for m=1: y from 0 to 1, points: (1,0),(1,1), two points, yes.

But in the path, the first point (1,0) is already set as the start, so when moving north, it adds 2m - 1 new points? For m=1, adds one new point: (1,1). But we have two points in total for north segment, but the start is included.

In terms of the path, the north segment consists of the points from (m, -m+1) to (m,m), inclusive, which is 2m points.

Similarly for other segments.

After reaching (m,m), it moves west to (-m,m).

So from x=m to x=-m, same y=m.

x from m to -m, inclusive? Start at (m,m), move west to (m-1,m), ..., to (-m,m).

x-values: from m down to -m, inclusive.

Number of points: m - (-m) + 1 = 2m +1.

But for m=1: from x=1 to x=-1, points: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), three points. But (1,1) is already set (from north end), so new points added: (0,1) and (-1,1), two points.

Total points in west segment: three, but including the start.

Similarly, then south from (-m,m) to (-m,-m).

y from m to -m, inclusive? Start at (-m,m), move south to (-m,m-1), ..., to (-m,-m).

y-values: from m down to -m, inclusive, number: m - (-m) +1 = 2m+1.

For m=1: y from 1 to -1, points: (-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1), three points.

But (-1,1) is already set (from west end), so new points added: (-1,0),(-1,-1).

Then east from (-m,-m) to (m,-m).

x from -m to m, inclusive, number: m - (-m) +1 = 2m+1.

For m=1: x from -1 to 1, points: (-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1), three points, but (-1,-1) already set, so new points: (0,-1),(1,-1).

Now total points: north: 2m, west: 2m+1, south: 2m+1, east: 2m+1? But total should be 8m.

For m=1: north:2, west:3, south:3, east:3? 2+3+3+3=11, but should be 8, inconsistency.

Problem: the corners are shared.

In the north segment, it includes (m,-m+1) to (m,m), which includes the start and the end.

West segment includes (m,m) to (-m,m), but (m,m) is already included in north.

Similarly, south includes (-m,m) to (-m,-m), and east includes (-m,-m) to (m,-m).

So the corners are counted twice if we just add.

To avoid double-counting, we should consider that each segment starts from the last point of previous, but since it's already placed, we add new points.

For layer m, it starts at (m, -m+1) with the first number.

Then:

- Move north: to (m, y) for y from -m+2 to m. So adds points with y = -m+2, -m+3, ..., m. Number of new points: from -m+2 to m inclusive: m - (-m+2) + 1 = m + m -2 +1 = 2m -1.

Start y_s = -m+2, y_e = m, number: m - (-m+2) + 1 = 2m -1.

For m=1: y from -1+2=1 to 1, so only y=1, one point: (1,1). Which is correct, adds 3.

Then move west: from (m,m) to (-m,m), but excluding start? Start at (m,m), move west to (m-1,m), ..., to (-m,m). But (m,m) is already occupied, so new points: x from m-1 down to -m, same y=m.

x-values: m-1, m-2, ..., -m.

Number: from m-1 to -m, inclusive: (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 + m +1 = 2m.

For m=1: x from 1-1=0 to -1, so x=0,-1? Points (0,1),(-1,1), two points. Correct, adds 4 and 5.

Then move south: from (-m,m) to (-m,-m). Start at (-m,m), already occupied, move south to (-m, m-1), ..., to (-m,-m).

New points: y from m-1 down to -m, same x=-m.

y-values: m-1, m-2, ..., -m.

Number: (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 + m +1 = 2m.

For m=1: y from 1-1=0 to -1, so y=0,-1? Points (-1,0),(-1,-1), adds 6 and 7.

Then move east: from (-m,-m) to (m,-m). Start at (-m,-m), occupied, move east to (-m+1,-m), ..., to (m,-m).

New points: x from -m+1 to m, same y=-m.

x-values: -m+1, -m+2, ..., m.

Number: m - (-m+1) + 1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

For m=1: x from -1+1=0 to 1, so x=0,1? Points (0,-1),(1,-1), adds 8 and 9.

Total new points: north: 2m-1, west:2m, south:2m, east:2m. Sum: (2m-1) + 2m + 2m + 2m = 8m -1. But should be 8m, since total numbers in layer is 8m, but we have the start point already, so total points are 1 (start) + (8m-1) = 8m, yes.

Good.

Now, for a given point (x,y) in layer m (i.e., max(|x|,|y|)=m), we can find where it is in the layer and compute the number.

The number at (x,y) is the start number of layer plus the offset in the path.

Start number of layer m is s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1.

Then we traverse: first north segment, then west, then south, then east.

Each segment adds a certain number of points.

To find the offset, we need to see in which segment the point is, and its position in that segment.

Now, for a point (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|)=m.

Now, depending on its position, it could be on the north, west, south, or east side.

Specifically:

- If y = m and |x| < m? But at corners, it might be shared, but since max is m, and if |x| < m, but y=m, then it's on the top side, so in west segment? Let's see.

The segments:

- North segment: points where x = m, and y from -m+1 to m.

But since max(|x|,|y|)=m, and x=m, so |y| <= m, but since x=m, max is m, so y can be from -m to m, but in the north segment, it's from y=-m+1 to m, but y=-m is not included? For example m=1: north segment: x=1, y=0 and y=1. But y=-1 is not in north; it's in south or east.

Actually, for a fixed m, the north side is when x=m and y > -m? But y=-m is corner.

Typically, the sides are:

- Right side: x=m, -m <= y <= m? But includes corners.

But in our path, the north segment is specifically the vertical move on x=m, but only for y from -m+1 to m, excluding y=-m.

Similarly, west segment is on y=m, x from m down to -m, but excluding x=m? Start from x=m.

To classify, we can see based on the direction.

Note that:

- If x = m and y < m, then it might be in north segment.

Specifically, for north segment: x = m, and y >= -m+1, and since max is m, y <= m.

But y >= -m+1, and since x=m, |y| <= m, but y could be -m, but if y=-m, it would be on the bottom, not north.

In fact, for north segment, x=m, and y > -m? Since it starts at y=-m+1 > -m.

So condition: x = m and y >= -m+1 and y <= m.

But since max(|x|,|y|)=m and x=m, we have |y| <= m, so y >= -m, but here y >= -m+1, so it's x=m and -m+1 <= y <= m.

Similarly, west segment: after north, so y=m, and x < m? But starts at x=m, but that point is already included in north, so for new points, x < m, but in the segment, it includes x from m to -m, but only the points with y=m and x <= m, but excluding the start if we consider only new, but for the segment, it includes all points with y=m and x from -m to m? But for west segment, it's specifically when moving west, so y=m, and x decreasing.

In the path, the west segment consists of points where y=m and x <= m, but since max is m, and y=m, so |x| <= m, so x >= -m.

But the north segment already included (m,m), so for west segment, it includes (m,m) to (-m,m), but (m,m) is shared.

To avoid confusion, we can define the segments exclusively.

For a point on the perimeter, it belongs to one segment based on the direction.

But corners might be shared, but in this path, each corner is the start or end of a segment.

Specifically:

- The point (m,m) is the end of north segment and start of west segment.

- (-m,m) is end of west and start of south.

- (-m,-m) is end of south and start of east.

- (m,-m) is end of east.

Now for our purpose, since we need the offset, we can include the corner in one segment or the other, but consistently.

In the traversal, the north segment includes (m,-m+1) to (m,m).

West segment includes (m,m) to (-m,m)? But (m,m) is repeated.

To compute the cumulative offset, we can assign the corner to the next segment.

For example, in north segment, include from (m,-m+1) to (m,m-1)? But then (m,m) is not included.

Better to include all points in the segment as per path.

For offset calculation, we can compute the cumulative steps.

Define the segments in order:

1. North segment: from (m, -m+1) to (m, m). This includes points with x=m, y from -m+1 to m inclusive.

Number of points: as before, 2m.

The y-coordinates range from -m+1 to m.

The offset in this segment: since it moves north, increasing y, so the offset depends on y.

Specifically, the y-value increases from -m+1 to m.

So for a point (m,y), the offset in the north segment is proportional to y - (-m+1).

The first point (m,-m+1) has offset 0 in this segment? But it's the start of layer.

Set: at (m,-m+1), offset 0.

Then moving north, each step increases y by 1, so for each increase in y, offset increases by 1.

So for point (m,y), offset in north segment is y - (-m+1).

Since y >= -m+1, offset >=0.

For example m=1: (1,y), y from 0 to 1.

At y=0: offset = 0 - (-1+1) = 0 - 0 =0.

At y=1: offset=1-0=1.

But total offset: since it's the first segment, the number is s_m + offset.

s_m = (2m-1)^2 +1.

For m=1, s1=1^2 +1=2.

At (1,0): offset=0, number=2+0=2, correct.

At (1,1): offset=1, number=2+1=3, correct.

Now, after north segment, we have added 2m points: from offset 0 to 2m-1? Since number of points is 2m, offsets 0 to 2m-1.

At (m,m), offset= m - (-m+1) = m + m -1 = 2m-1.

Now next, west segment: starts at (m,m), but this point is already included in north, so for the west segment, we start from the next point, but since it's continuous, we need to include it or not.

In the path, after (m,m), we move west to (m-1,m), etc.

So the west segment includes points from (m,m) to (-m,m), inclusive? But (m,m) is already counted.

To avoid double-counting, in the cumulative offset, when we start west segment, we have already covered the north segment, so the offset for west segment starts after north.

So cumulative offset: after north segment, we have covered 2m points (offsets 0 to 2m-1).

Now west segment: points with y=m, and x from m down to -m.

But since (m,m) is already included in north, if we include it again, it would be double.

So for west segment, we should start from (m-1,m) to (-m,m), excluding (m,m).

The points added in west segment: as earlier, x from m-1 down to -m, same y=m.

Number: 2m points? Earlier we said 2m new points, but for m=1, from x=0 to -1? But x=m-1=0, to x=-m=-1, points (0,1),(-1,1), two points, which is 2m.

But the segment includes (m-1,m) to (-m,m).

Now, the x-coordinates: from m-1 down to -m, inclusive.

So for a point (x,m), with x <= m-1, x >= -m.

The offset in west segment: since it moves west, decreasing x.

Start at (m-1,m)? But the first point is (m-1,m).

So offset 0 at (m-1,m).

Then as x decreases, offset increases.

So offset = (m-1) - x.

Since x decreases from m-1 to -m, so m-1 - x ranges from 0 to (m-1) - (-m) = m-1 + m = 2m-1.

Number of points: from x=m-1 to x=-m, inclusive, number is (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 + m +1 = 2m.

Offsets from 0 to 2m-1.

For example m=1: points x=0,-1? At (0,1): offset=1-1 -0? m-1 -x=1-1-0=0? x=0, offset=0.

At (-1,1): offset=1-1 -(-1)=0+1=1.

Cumulative offset: after north, we have 2 points (for m=1), so cumulative offset before west is 2 (since offsets 0 and 1).

Start of west: first point (0,1), cumulative offset = offset from start of layer + offset in segment.

Offset from start of layer: since north had 2 points, indices 0 and 1, so next index is 2.

At (0,1): offset in segment is 0, so cumulative offset = 2 + 0 = 2.

Number = s_m + cumulative offset = 2 + 2 =4? But should be 4, yes.

At (-1,1): offset in segment=1, cumulative=2+1=3, number=2+3=5? s_m=2, 2+3=5, but should be 5, yes.

Now next, south segment: after west, ends at (-m,m).

Move south to (-m, m-1), ..., to (-m,-m).

Points: same x=-m, y from m-1 down to -m.

Exclude the start (-m,m) since it's already in west? In west segment, we included up to (-m,m), so for south, we start from (-m, m-1) to (-m,-m).

New points: y from m-1 down to -m, inclusive.

Number: (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 + m +1 = 2m.

Offset in south segment: start at (-m, m-1), offset 0.

Move south, decreasing y, so offset = (m-1) - y.

y from m-1 down to -m, so (m-1) - y from 0 to (m-1) - (-m) = m-1 + m = 2m-1.

Cumulative offset before south: after north and west, total points so far: north 2m, west 2m, total 4m.

For m=1: 2+2=4 points: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5.

Now south: points (-1,y), y from 1-1=0 to -1? y=0,-1.

At (-1,0): offset in south= (m-1) - y = (1-1) - 0 = 0 - 0 =0? But should be offset 0.

Cumulative offset = 4 + 0 =4? Number= s_m + offset=2+4=6, correct.

At (-1,-1): offset in south= (0) - (-1) =1? Cumulative=4+1=5, number=2+5=7, correct.

Then east segment: after south, ends at (-m,-m).

Move east to (-m+1,-m), ..., to (m,-m).

Points: same y=-m, x from -m+1 to m.

Exclude start (-m,-m) since already in south.

So points (-m+1,-m) to (m,-m).

Number: from x=-m+1 to m, inclusive: m - (-m+1) +1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

Offset in east segment: start at (-m+1,-m), offset 0.

Move east, increasing x, so offset = x - (-m+1).

x from -m+1 to m, so offset from 0 to m - (-m+1) = m + m -1 = 2m-1.

Cumulative offset before east: after north, west, south: 2m + 2m + 2m = 6m.

For m=1: 6 points, cumulative offset 6.

At (0,-1): offset in east= x - (-m+1) = 0 - (-1+1) =0-0=0? Cumulative=6+0=6, number=2+6=8, correct.

At (1,-1): offset=1 - 0=1? Cumulative=6+1=7, number=2+7=9, correct.

Now, what about the corners? For example, (m,-m) is in east segment, offset= x - (-m+1) = m - (-m+1) = 2m-1, cumulative=6m + (2m-1) = 8m-1, number=s_m + 8m -1 = [(2m-1)^2 +1] + 8m -1 = (4m^2 -4m +1) +1 +8m -1 = 4m^2 +4m +1 = (2m+1)^2, which is correct, the last number.

Now, for points not on the perimeter? But in layer m, all points are on the perimeter since it's the outermost layer for that square. Layer m consists of points where max(|x|,|y|)=m, which are exactly the perimeter of the square from -m to m, excluding the inner part, but since it's the layer, it includes all points with max(|x|,|y|)=m, which for a square, is the boundary, but not including points where max < m.

In the spiral, layer m includes all points that are added in that layer, which are exactly those with max(|x|,|y|)=m. And since the inner layers are already filled, yes.

Moreover, these points are all on the boundary of the square [-m,m] x [-m,m].

Now, for such a point, we can determine which side it's on, but in our segment definition, we have covered all possibilities.

Specifically:

- If x = m, then it's on the north segment, as long as y >= -m+1 and y <= m. But since max(|x|,|y|)=m and x=m, |y|<=m, and if y >= -m+1, then it's in north segment.

But what if y = -m? Then x=m, max(|x|,|y|)=m, but y=-m, which is the bottom-right corner. In this case, it should be in the east segment? Because east segment includes (m,-m).

Similarly, if y=m and x < m, it's in west segment, but if x=m, it's in north.

So for x=m, if y > -m, specifically y >= -m+1, it's in north, but if y = -m, it's in east.

Similarly, for y=m, if x < m, it's in west, but if x=m, it's in north.

For x=-m, if y > -m, it's in south? South segment includes x=-m, y from m-1 down to -m, but excludes y=m? Earlier we have south segment includes (-m,y) for y from m-1 to -m, inclusive? In our earlier, for south segment, we included y from m-1 to -m, so includes y=-m.

But for x=-m, y=m: if y=m, and x=-m, max=m, but in west segment? West segment includes (-m,m), since it goes to (-m,m).

So conflict.

For example, point (-m,m): max(|x|,|y|)=m.

In west segment: when we move west, we end at (-m,m), so it's included in west segment.

In south segment, we start from (-m,m-1), so (-m,m) is not in south segment.

Similarly, (-m,-m) is in south segment, since we end there.

(m,-m) is in east segment.

So to summarize:

For a point (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|)=m:

- If x = m and y > -m, then north segment? But y >= -m+1 > -m, so yes, but excludes y=-m.

Specifically: if x = m and y >= -m+1, then north segment.

- Else if y = m and x < m, then west segment? But when x=m, it's in north, so for west, y=m and x <= m, but since x=m is excluded, so y=m and x < m? But x >= -m.

Since max is m, and y=m, x >= -m.

So if y = m and x <= m, but since x=m is already covered, so for west segment: y=m and -m <= x <= m-1? Since x < m.

But at x=-m, it's included.

For example m=1: (-1,1): y=1, x=-1 <1? 1 is m, so x < m=1, yes, and x=-1 >= -1, so in west segment.

Similarly, (0,1): x=0<1, in west.

(1,1): x=1=m, so not in west, in north.

Now, if x = -m, then? For example (-m,y).

If y = m, it's in west segment.

If y < m, then? For example (-m,0), should be in south segment.

Specifically: if x = -m and y < m, then south segment? But y could be -m.

In south segment, we have y from m-1 down to -m, so includes y=-m.

But when y=m, it's not in south.

So: if x = -m and y <= m-1? Since y < m, and y >= -m.

Since max is m, y >= -m.

So if x = -m and -m <= y <= m-1, then south segment.

But at y=m, it's not included, good.

Then, finally, if none of the above, but max=m, then it must be on the bottom side, i.e., y = -m, and since not in north (which requires x=m and y>=-m+1), and not in west or south, so if y = -m and x > -m, then east segment.

But when x=m and y=-m, it should be in east, but according to above, if y=-m and x> -m, but if x=m, it is greater than -m, so included.

And if x=-m and y=-m, it's in south segment, not east.

So check: for (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|)=m,

- If x = m and y >= -m+1, then north segment.

- Else if y = m and x <= m-1, then west segment. (since if x=m, already covered)

x <= m-1 and since max=m, x >= -m.

- Else if x = -m and y <= m-1, then south segment. (since if y=m, already covered in west)

- Else if y = -m and x >= -m+1, then east segment. (since if x=-m, it would be in south)

Now, is there any point missing? For example, corner (m,-m): x=m, y=-m. Now, y=-m >= -m+1? -m >= -m+1? No, -m < -m+1, so not in north. y=m? No. x=-m? No. y=-m, and x=m >= -m+1? Since m >=1, m > -m+1? For m=1, -1+1=0, 1>0 yes, so in east segment, correct.

Corner (-m,-m): x=-m, y=-m. Not in north (x≠m). Not in west (y≠m). Then x=-m and y=-m <= m-1? For m=1, y=-1 <=0? Yes, so in south segment, correct.

Corner (-m,m): not in north, y=m and x=-m <= m-1? For m=1, x=-1 <=0? Yes, so in west segment, correct.

Corner (m,m): in north segment, since x=m, y=m >= -m+1, yes.

Now, for non-corners, say (m,0) for m>1: x=m, y=0 >= -m+1? Since m>=1, -m+1 <=0? For m=2, -2+1=-1, 0>=-1 yes, so north.

Similarly, (0,m): y=m, x=0 <= m-1? For m=2, 0<=1 yes, so west.

(-m,0): x=-m, y=0 <= m-1? For m=2, 0<=1 yes, so south.

(0,-m): y=-m, x=0 >= -m+1? For m=2, -2+1=-1, 0>=-1 yes, so east.

Good.

Now, for each segment, we have the offset within the segment, and the cumulative offset before the segment.

As above:

- North segment: offset_local = y - (-m + 1)

Cumulative offset before: 0 (since first segment)

So total offset = offset_local

- West segment: offset_local = (m - 1) - x  ? Earlier we had offset_local = (m-1) - x

In west segment, x from -m to m-1, decreasing.

At x=m-1, offset_local=0, at x=-m, offset_local= (m-1) - (-m) = 2m-1

Cumulative offset before west: number of points in north = 2m

So total offset = 2m + offset_local = 2m + (m-1 - x)

- South segment: offset_local = (m-1) - y

Cumulative before south: north + west = 2m + 2m = 4m

Total offset = 4m + (m-1 - y)

- East segment: offset_local = x - (-m + 1)

Cumulative before east: north + west + south = 2m + 2m + 2m = 6m

Total offset = 6m + (x - (-m + 1))

Now, the number at (x,y) is s_m + total offset, where s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Now, for our case, we have the neighbors of (23,-22), and m for each neighbor might be different? No, because neighbors are adjacent, so they might be in the same layer or adjacent layers.

Specifically, since (23,-22) is on layer m=23, because max(|23|,|-22|)=max(23,22)=23.

Now the neighbors:

N: (23,-21): max(|23|,|-21|)=max(23,21)=23, same layer.

S: (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, same.

E: (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, different layer.

W: (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, different.

NE: (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, different.

NW: (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, different.

SE: (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, different.

SW: (22,-23): max(22,23)=23? |22|=22, |23|=23, max=23, same layer.

Let me compute:

- N: (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23

- S: (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23

- E: (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24

- W: (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22

- NE: (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24

- NW: (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22

- SE: (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24

- SW: (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23

So, same layer (m=23) for: N, S, SW? SW: (22,-23), max(22,23)=23, yes.

S: (23,-23), max(23,23)=23.

N: (23,-21), max(23,21)=23.

SW: (22,-23), max(22,23)=23.

But W: (22,-22), max(22,22)=22, different.

E: (24,-22), max(24,22)=24, different.

NE: (24,-21), max(24,21)=24.

SE: (24,-23), max(24,23)=24.

NW: (22,-21), max(22,21)=22.

So neighbors in same layer m=23: N(23,-21), S(23,-23), SW(22,-23)

But that's only three? What about others? For example, west is (22,-22), which is layer 22.

Similarly, east is layer 24.

But there should be neighbors like northwest, but NW is (22,-21), layer 22.

And northeast (24,-21), layer 24.

Southeast (24,-23), layer 24.

Southwest is already included.

But what about west? (22,-22), layer 22.

And east? (24,-22), layer 24.

But north and south are same, southwest same.

But missing northwest and southeast? No, NW is (22,-21), which is layer 22, SE is (24,-23), layer 24.

But is there a neighbor directly west? (22,-22) is west, but it's layer 22.

Similarly, directly east is layer 24.

But also, northeast is (24,-21), layer 24, etc.

But for the eight neighbors, we have:

- Same layer: N(23,-21), S(23,-23), SW(22,-23)

But SW is southwest, which is (-1,-1) direction, but in coordinates, from (23,-22), SW is (22,-23), yes.

But what about west? West is (22,-22), which is not same layer.

Similarly, northwest is (22,-21), not same.

So only three neighbors in same layer? That can't be right because typically, in the grid, each cell has neighbors, but since it's on the boundary of the layer, some neighbors might be in inner or outer layers.

Specifically, since (23,-22) is on the "east" side? Let's see which segment it is in.

For (23,-22), m=23.

x=23=m, y=-22.

Now, y=-22 >= -m+1? -m+1=-23+1=-22, so y>=-22, and y=-22 >= -22? Yes, equal.

So since x=m and y >= -m+1, it is in north segment.

y=-22, -m+1=-23+1=-22, so y = -m+1, which is the start.

So it is in north segment.

Now, in north segment, so it's on the right side.

Now, its neighbors:

- North: (23,-21), same x, y+1, which is still in north segment since y=-21 >= -22? -21 > -22, and -21 >= -m+1=-22, yes, so same segment, same layer.

- South: (23,-23), same x, y-1. Now y=-23 < -22? -m+1=-22, so y=-23 < -22, so not in north segment. Is it in another segment? Check: x=23=m, but y=-23 < -m+1=-22? -23 < -22, so not in north. y=m? m=23, y=-23 ≠23. x=-m? x=23≠-23. y=-m? y=-23, and x=23 >= -m+1? -m+1=-23+1=-22, x=23 >= -22? Yes, so it should be in east segment? For east segment: y=-m and x >= -m+1.

Here y=-23, -m=-23? m=23, -m=-23, yes. x=23 >= -23+1=-22? 23 >= -22, yes. So in east segment, but same layer m=23? Since max(|23|,|-23|)=23, yes.

But earlier I thought S is same layer, which it is, but in a different segment.

Similarly, west: (22,-22), max(|22|,|-22|)=22, so layer m=22.

Similarly, east: (24,-22), max(24,22)=24, layer 24.

Now, for southwest: (22,-23), x=22,y=-23, max(22,23)=23, same layer.

Similarly, northwest: (22,-21), max(22,21)=22, layer 22.

Northeast: (24,-21), max(24,21)=24, layer 24.

Southeast: (24,-23), max(24,23)=24, layer 24.

So we have neighbors in three different layers: m=22,23,24.

Specifically:

- Layer 23: N(23,-21), S(23,-23), SW(22,-23)

- Layer 22: W(22,-22), NW(22,-21)

- Layer 24: E(24,-22), NE(24,-21), SE(24,-23)

SW is in layer 23, but NW is in layer 22? NW is (22,-21), max(22,21)=22, yes.

But SW is (22,-23), max(22,23)=23, yes.

Now, we need to compute the number at each of these eight positions.

So we need to compute f(x,y) for each neighbor.

To compute f(x,y), we first find m = max(|x|,|y|), then determine which segment it's in, then compute offset, then number.

s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Then total offset as above.

Now, let's compute for each neighbor.

First, list them:

1. N: (23,-21), m=max(23,21)=23

Segment: x=23=m, y=-21 >= -m+1 = -23+1=-22? -21 >= -22, yes, so north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m +1) = -21 - (-22) = -21 +22 =1

Cumulative before: 0 (since north first)

Total offset = 1

s_m = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026

Number = s_m + total offset = 2026 + 1 = 2027

But is that correct? The point itself is (23,-22), which is start, number 2026.

North should be the next one, since moving north, so yes, 2027.

But we need neighbors, but this is for neighbor.

Now, S: (23,-23), m=23

x=23=m, y=-23

y=-23 >= -m+1? -23 >= -22? No, -23 < -22, so not north.

y=m? 23? y=-23 ≠23.

x=-m? -23? x=23≠-23.

y=-m? y=-23, and x=23 >= -m+1? -m+1=-23+1=-22, x=23 >= -22? Yes, so east segment.

Offset_local = x - (-m +1) = 23 - (-23 +1) = 23 - (-22) = 23 +22=45

Cumulative before east: 6m = 6*23=138

Total offset = 138 + 45 = 183

s_m=2026

Number=2026 + 183 = 2209? But s_m is the start, but east segment is the last segment, so should be larger.

s_m + total offset = 2026 + 183 = 2209

But the end of layer is (2m+1)^2=47^2=2209, and (23,-23) should be a corner? x=23,y=-23, which is bottom-right? For layer m, bottom-right is (m,-m)=(23,-23), and it should be the last number, (2m+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes.

But is it adjacent? S is (23,-23), and original is (23,-22), so same x, y differs by 1, so yes, adjacent vertically.

Now, SW: (22,-23), m=max(22,23)=23

x=22, y=-23

Check segments:

x=m? 23? x=22≠23.

y=m? 23? y=-23≠23.

x=-m? -23? x=22≠-23.

y=-m? y=-23, and x=22 >= -m+1? -23+1=-22, x=22 >= -22? Yes, so east segment.

Offset_local = x - (-m +1) = 22 - (-23 +1) = 22 - (-22) = 22 + 22 = 44

Cumulative before east: 6m=138

Total offset=138+44=182

s_m=2026

Number=2026+182=2208

Now, next, neighbors in layer 22.

First, W: (22,-22), m=max(22,22)=22

s_m = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

Now segment: x=22=m, y=-22

y=-22 >= -m+1? -22+1=-21? y=-22 >= -21? No, -22 < -21, so not north.

y=m? 22? y=-22≠22.

x=-m? -22? x=22≠-22? Wait, x=22, -m=-22, so x ≠ -m? But x=m=22, while -m=-22, not equal.

y=-m? y=-22, and x=22 >= -m+1? -22+1=-21, x=22 >= -21? Yes, so east segment.

Offset_local = x - (-m +1) = 22 - (-22 +1) = 22 - (-21) = 22 + 21 = 43

Cumulative before east: 6m=6*22=132

Total offset=132+43=175

Number= s_m + offset = 1850 + 175 = 2025

1850 + 175=2025, which is 45^2, and since layer 22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, and (22,-22) is bottom-right corner, so yes.

Now, NW: (22,-21), m=22

x=22=m, y=-21

y=-21 >= -m+1? -22+1=-21, so y=-21 >= -21, yes, so north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m +1) = -21 - (-22 +1) = -21 - (-21) = -21 +21=0

Cumulative before: 0

Total offset=0

s_m=1850

Number=1850 + 0 = 1850

Now, neighbors in layer 24.

First, E: (24,-22), m=max(24,22)=24

s_m = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

Segment: x=24=m, y=-22

y=-22 >= -m+1? -24+1=-23? -22 >= -23? Yes, so north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m +1) = -22 - (-24 +1) = -22 - (-23) = -22 +23=1

Cumulative before: 0

Total offset=1

Number=2210 +1=2211

Now, NE: (24,-21), m=24

x=24=m, y=-21

y=-21 >= -m+1? -24+1=-23? -21 >= -23? Yes, so north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m +1) = -21 - (-23) = -21 +23=2

Total offset=2 (since cumulative 0)

Number=2210 +2=2212

Now, SE: (24,-23), m=24

x=24=m, y=-23

y=-23 >= -m+1? -24+1=-23? -23 >= -23? Yes, so north segment? But y=-23, -m+1=-23, so equal.

Offset_local = y - (-m +1) = -23 - (-24 +1) = -23 - (-23) = -23 +23=0

Total offset=0

Number=2210 +0=2210

But is this correct? (24,-23), should be the start of layer 24? Since for layer m, start at (m, -m+1)=(24,-24+1)=(24,-23), yes, so number s_m=2210, correct.

Now, we have all eight neighbors:

List:

N: (23,-21) = 2027

S: (23,-23) = 2209

SW: (22,-23) = 2208

W: (22,-22) = 2025

NW: (22,-21) = 1850

E: (24,-22) = 2211

NE: (24,-21) = 2212

SE: (24,-23) = 2210

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers:

2027, 2209, 2208, 2025, 1850, 2211, 2212, 2210

Now sum.

First, group them.

Notice that some are consecutive or close.

Since they are neighbors, but perhaps compute pairwise.

List in order:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Now sum.

Add step by step.

First, the layer 22 neighbors: NW=1850, W=2025

Sum: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Layer 23 neighbors: N=2027, S=2209, SW=2208

Sum: 2027 + 2208 = 4235, plus 2209 = 4235 + 2209 = 6444? Let me compute:

2027 + 2208 = 2027 + 2200 + 8 = 4227 + 8 = 4235? 2027 + 2200 = 4227, +8=4235, yes.

Then 4235 + 2209 = 4235 + 2200 = 6435, +9=6444.

Layer 24 neighbors: E=2211, NE=2212, SE=2210

Sum: 2211 + 2212 = 4423, plus 2210 = 4423 + 2210 = 6633? 4423 + 2200 = 6623, +10=6633.

Now total sum: layer22 + layer23 + layer24 = 3875 + 6444 + 6633

First, 3875 + 6444.

3875 + 6400 = 10275, plus 44 = 10319? Better: 3875 + 6444.

3000+6000=9000, 875+444=1319? 800+400=1200, 75+44=119, total 1200+119=1319, so 9000+1319=10319.

Now add layer24: 10319 + 6633.

10319 + 6600 = 16919, plus 33 = 16952.

10319 + 6633.

10000 + 6000 = 16000

319 + 633 = 952

Total 16000 + 952 = 16952.

Is that right? 319 + 633: 300+600=900, 19+33=52, total 952, yes.

So sum is 16952.

But let me verify with another way.

Notice that some numbers are close to the corners.

For example, original point is 2026, which is start of layer 23.

Its neighbors:

North: 2027, which is next in north direction.

South: 2209, which is the end of the layer, since (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

SW: 2208, which is before end.

W: 2025, which is end of previous layer, since layer 22 ends at 45^2=2025.

NW: 1850, which is start of layer 22? s_m for m=22 is (43)^2 +1=1849+1=1850, yes, which is at (22,-21)? Earlier we computed (22,-21)=1850, and for layer 22, start at (m,-m+1)=(22,-22+1)=(22,-21), yes, so northwest neighbor is the start of layer 22.

E: 2211, which is second in layer 24, since start is 2210 at (24,-23), then north to (24,-22)=2211? Earlier computation: E is (24,-22)=2211, and NE is (24,-21)=2212.

SE is (24,-23)=2210, start.

Now sum: 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Now, we can pair:

1850 and 2212? Not symmetric.

Notice that 1850 + 2212 = ? 1850 + 2200 = 4050, +12=4062? Not helpful.

Group consecutive:

1850 (NW)

2025 (W)

2027 (N)

2208 (SW)

2209 (S)

2210 (SE)

2211 (E)

2212 (NE)

Now, sum from 2025 to 2027: 2025+2027=4052, plus 2026? But not included.

Note that 2025 and 2027 are symmetric around 2026.

Similarly, 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 might be around something.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Sum = 1850 + (2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)

Compute each:

2025 + 2027 = 4052

Now 2208 to 2212: this is an arithmetic series? 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Five terms, average 2210, sum=5*2210=11050.

2208+2212=4420, 2209+2211=4420, and 2210, so 4420+4420=8840, plus 2210=11050, yes.

Now total sum: 1850 + 4052 + 11050

First, 1850 + 4052 = 5902

Then 5902 + 11050 = 16952

Same as before.

1850 + 11050 = 12900, plus 4052 = 12900 + 4000 = 16900, +52=16952.

So sum is 16952.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a smaller example to see if the neighbor sum makes sense.

Suppose we take number 1, at (0,0). Its neighbors should be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? In the initial grid.

From earlier: east: (1,0)=2, northeast? (1,1)=3, north? (0,1)=4? In our grid, (0,1)=4, but directly north should be (0,1), which is 4? But adjacent.

Standard neighbors: for (0,0):

N: (0,1)=4? But in spiral, (0,1) is 4.

S: (0,-1)=8

E: (1,0)=2

W: (-1,0)=6

NE: (1,1)=3

NW: (-1,1)=5

SE: (1,-1)=9

SW: (-1,-1)=7

So neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? 2(E),3(NE),4(N),5(NW),6(W),7(SW),8(S),9(SE).

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9= let's see, arithmetic series, sum= (2+9)*8/2=11*4=44.

Now, according to our method, for n=1, but it's center, layer 0.

But in our case, 2026 is not center, but on the boundary.

Another example: take number 2, at (1,0).

Neighbors: should include 1,3,9? etc.

Position (1,0), m=max(1,0)=1.

Neighbors:

N: (1,1)=3

S: (1,-1)=9

E: (2,-1)? But not yet, in initial, but for larger, but in layer, but we need to compute.

For (1,0), neighbors:

N: (1,1)

S: (1,-1)

E: (2,0)? But (2,0) is in next layer.

W: (0,0)=1

NE: (2,1)

NW: (0,1)=4

SE: (2,-1)

SW: (0,-1)=8

In the grid we have: (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (0,0)=1, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8, but (2,0),(2,1),(2,-1) are not in the initial 3x3, but for larger spiral.

After 9, next is 10 at (2,-1), etc.

So for (1,0)=2, neighbors:

- W: (0,0)=1

- NW: (0,1)=4

- N: (1,1)=3

- NE: (2,1)? Later

- E: (2,0)? Later

- SE: (2,-1)? Later

- S: (1,-1)=9

- SW: (0,-1)=8

So immediate neighbors: 1(W), 4(NW), 3(N), but NE, E, SE are in outer layer, which are 10,11,12? At (2,-1)=10, (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12.

But SW is (0,-1)=8, S is (1,-1)=9.

So neighbors: 1,3,4,8,9, and 10,11,12? But that's eight: W:1, NW:4, N:3, NE:12? Assuming, E:11, SE:10, S:9, SW:8.

In the spiral, after 9, next is 10 at (2,-1), then 11 at (2,0), then 12 at (2,1), etc.

So yes, neighbors are: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=4, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=12, (2,0)=11, (2,-1)=10, (1,-1)=9, (0,-1)=8.

So numbers: 1,4,3,12,11,10,9,8.

Sum: 1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12.

Compute: 1+12=13, 3+11=14, 4+10=14, 8+9=17? Better: list: 1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12.

Sum: 1+3=4, +4=8, +8=16, +9=25, +10=35, +11=46, +12=58.

Now, according to our formula, for (1,0), m=1.

But we need neighbors:

N: (1,1), m=max(1,1)=1

S: (1,-1), m=1

E: (2,0), m=max(2,0)=2

W: (0,0), m=max(0,0)=0? Oh, different.

NE: (2,1), m=2

NW: (0,1), m=max(0,1)=1

SE: (2,-1), m=2

SW: (0,-1), m=max(0,1)=1? |0|=0,|1|=1, max=1.

So neighbors in m=0: W(0,0)

m=1: N(1,1), S(1,-1), NW(0,1), SW(0,-1)

m=2: E(2,0), NE(2,1), SE(2,-1)

Now compute each:

First, W: (0,0), m=0. Layer 0, only one point, number 1.

Now, for m=1 neighbors:

N: (1,1), m=1, segment: x=1=m, y=1 >= -1+1=0? Yes, north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m+1) =1 - (-1+1)=1-0=1

Total offset=1 (since north)

s_m=(2*1-1)^2 +1=1^2 +1=2? But should be 3? Mistake.

s_m for m=1 is (2*1-1)^2 +1=1+1=2, but at (1,1) should be 3.

Offset_local=1, total offset=1, number=2+1=3, yes.

S: (1,-1), m=1

x=1=m, y=-1

y=-1 >= -m+1? -1+1=0? -1>=0? No, so not north.

y=m?1? y=-1≠1.

x=-m?-1? x=1≠-1.

y=-m? y=-1, and x=1 >= -m+1? -1+1=0, 1>=0? Yes, so east segment.

Offset_local = x - (-m+1) =1 - (-1+1)=1-0=1

Cumulative before east: 6m=6*1=6

Total offset=6+1=7

s_m=2

Number=2+7=9, correct.

NW: (0,1), m=1

x=0,y=1

max(|0|,|1|)=1

Segment: x=m?1? no. y=m?1? yes, and x=0 <= m-1? m=1, m-1=0, x=0<=0? yes, so west segment.

Offset_local = (m-1) - x = (1-1) - 0 =0-0=0

Cumulative before west: 2m=2*1=2

Total offset=2+0=2

s_m=2

Number=2+2=4, correct.

SW: (0,-1), m=1

x=0,y=-1

Segment: not north, not west, not south? x=-m? -1? x=0≠-1. y=-m? y=-1, and x=0 >= -m+1? -1+1=0, 0>=0? yes, so east segment.

Offset_local = x - (-m+1) =0 - (-1+1)=0-0=0

Cumulative before east:6m=6

Total offset=6+0=6

s_m=2

Number=2+6=8, correct.

Now layer 2 neighbors:

E: (2,0), m=2

s_m=(2*2-1)^2 +1=(4-1)^2 +1=9+1=10

Segment: x=2=m, y=0 >= -m+1? -2+1=-1? 0>=-1? yes, so north segment.

Offset_local = y - (-m+1) =0 - (-2+1)=0 - (-1)=1

Total offset=1 (since north)

Number=10+1=11, correct.

NE: (2,1), m=2

x=2,y=1

North segment: y=1 >= -1? yes.

Offset_local= y - (-m+1)=1 - (-1)=1+1=2

Total offset=2

Number=10+2=12, correct.

SE: (2,-1), m=2

x=2,y=-1

y=-1 >= -m+1? -2+1=-1? yes, so north segment.

Offset_local= y - (-m+1)= -1 - (-1)= -1+1=0

Total offset=0

Number=10+0=10, correct.

So neighbors: W:1, NW:4, N:3, NE:12, E:11, SE:10, S:9, SW:8

Numbers:1,4,3,12,11,10,9,8 sum to 1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12= as before 58? 1+12=13, 3+11=14, 4+10=14, 8+9=17, total 13+14=27, +14=41, +17=58, yes.

In our calculation for 2026, we got sum 16952, which seems consistent.

But in the problem, it asks for sum of all eight neighbors, and we have computed all eight.

Now, to confirm, original number is 2026, neighbors sum to 16952.

Is there a pattern or easier way? Probably not necessary, since we have the answer.

But notice that in our sum, we have numbers from different layers, but we computed correctly.

Another way: since the neighbors include the start of inner layer, end of inner layer, start of outer layer, and some others.

But anyway, we have the sum.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me write it down.

Neighbors:

NW:1850

W:2025

N:2027

SW:2208

S:2209

SE:2210

E:2211

NE:2212

Sum: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

2027 + 2208 = 4235

2209 + 2210 = 4419? Better as before.

1850 + 2212 = 4062? Since they are symmetric? Not really.

From earlier calculation: 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Note that 2025 + 2027 = 4052

2208 + 2212 = 4420

2209 + 2211 = 4420

2210 alone = 2210

And 1850 alone.

But 1850 is extra.

Sum = 1850 + 4052 + (2208 + 2212) + (2209 + 2211) + 2210

2208+2212=4420

2209+2211=4420

So total: 1850 + 4052 + 4420 + 4420 + 2210

Now compute step by step.

1850 + 4052 = 5902

5902 + 4420 = 10322

10322 + 4420 = 14742

14742 + 2210 = 16952

Same as before.

1850 + 2210 = 4060? Then others.

But anyway, consistent.

So the sum is 16952.

Therefore, the answer is 16952.

But let me confirm the position again.

Original number: 2026 at (23,-22), layer m=23, start of layer.

North neighbor: (23,-21), same segment, offset 1, so 2027.

South neighbor: (23,-23), which is bottom-right corner, end of layer, 2209.

Southwest: (22,-23), which is on the east segment? Earlier we computed as east segment, offset 44, total 182, number 2208.

West: (22,-22), which is bottom-right corner of layer 22, 2025.

Northwest: (22,-21), start of layer 22, 1850.

East: (24,-22), second in layer 24, 2211.

Northeast: (24,-21), third? Offset 2, so 2212.

Southeast: (24,-23), start of layer 24, 2210.

All seem correct.

Sum is 16952.

So I think that's the answer.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, which is the start of layer \(m = 23\). The eight neighbors of this position are:

- North (N): (23, -21) → 2027
- South (S): (23, -23) → 2209
- Southwest (SW): (22, -23) → 2208
- West (W): (22, -22) → 2025
- Northwest (NW): (22, -21) → 1850
- East (E): (24, -22) → 2211
- Northeast (NE): (24, -21) → 2212
- Southeast (SE): (24, -23) → 2210

The sum of these neighbors is calculated as follows:

\[
1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212
\]

Grouping the terms:
- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(2208 + 2212 = 4420\)
- \(2209 + 2211 = 4420\)
- Remaining terms: \(1850\) and \(2210\)

Summing these:
\[
1850 + 2210 = 4060
\]
\[
4052 + 4420 = 8472
\]
\[
8472 + 4420 = 12892
\]
\[
12892 + 4060 = 16952
\]

Alternatively, summing all directly:
\[
1850 + 2025 = 3875
\]
\[
3875 + 2027 = 5902
\]
\[
5902 + 2208 = 8110
\]
\[
8110 + 2209 = 10319
\]
\[
10319 + 2210 = 12529
\]
\[
12529 + 2211 = 14740
\]
\[
14740 + 2212 = 16952
\]

Both methods confirm the sum is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
