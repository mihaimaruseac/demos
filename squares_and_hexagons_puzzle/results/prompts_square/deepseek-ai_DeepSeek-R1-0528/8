<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to understand how the spiral is laid out. It seems like it starts from the center with 1, then moves right to 2, down to 3? Let me sketch this out.

From the given:

- Above 1 is 4? No, looking at the grid:

It says: ... 5 4 3 ...

Then ... 6 1 2 ...

Then ... 7 8 9 ...

So, reading it as a grid, let's assume the center is 1.

So, row above: 5, 4, 3

Center row: 6, 1, 2

Row below: 7, 8, 9

But that doesn't make sense because typically spirals start at center and go outwards. Here, 1 is at center, then 2 is to the right, 3 is above? But 3 is above 4? I'm getting confused.

Perhaps the grid is oriented such that the numbers increase as we move clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let me list the positions.

Assume that the center is at some coordinate. Set (0,0) as the position of 1.

Then, 2 is to the right, so (1,0).

Then, 3 is above? But in the grid, above 1 is 4? The grid shows:

Position: let's say columns x, rows y.

Set x increasing right, y increasing up, like standard math coordinates.

So, for the center row: at y=0, x=-1:6? The grid is:

It says: ... 5 4 3 ... so probably x decreasing.

Perhaps it's better to think of the sequence.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are placed in a spiral pattern starting from center.

Let me recall the Ulam spiral or something, but that's for primes, but the layout is similar.

Typically, it starts at center, moves right, then up, left, down, etc.

In this case, from 1, it moves right to 2, then since it's surrounded, but 3 should be above 2? But in the grid, above 2 is 3? Let's see:

In the given grid:

Row above center: 5,4,3 — so if center is y=1, but better to set center at (0,0).

Set coordinate system: let (0,0) be position of 1.

Then, to the right, at (1,0) is 2.

Above 1, at (0,1) is? The grid shows above 1 is 4? But that can't be, because 4 is larger than 2.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the grid.

The grid is written as:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So, assuming this is a snapshot, with center row being 6,1,2, so at positions, say, x= -1,0,1 for that row.

Set for the center row: y=0.

At x= -1: 6

x=0: 1

x=1: 2

Then above, y=1, what is there? It says ...5 4 3, so probably at x= -1:5? But that would be above 6, which is at (-1,0), so above it at (-1,1) should be 5? But 5 is less than 6, but in spiral, numbers increase, so it should be higher numbers as we go out.

Perhaps the spiral is going counter-clockwise.

From 1, it goes right to 2, then up to 3? But in the grid, above 2 is not shown, but above 1 is 4, which is larger.

Let's calculate the positions.

Suppose at (0,0): 1

(1,0):2

Then next number 3 should be placed. Typically, after 2, it would go up or down. In standard spiral, it turns left or right.

In this case, from 1, go right to 2, then since it can't go further right? No, it can, but usually it turns when it hits a filled cell or boundary.

At start, 1 is placed. Then move right to place 2. Then move up to place 3? But in the grid, at (0,1) should be 3, but the grid shows at y=1, x=1 is 3? In the top row, it's 5,4,3, so if y=1, x=1 is 3, x=0 is 4, x=-1 is 5.

But then below, at y=-1, x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9.

But then what about 3? 3 is at (1,1)? But 4 is at (0,1), which is above 1, and 3 at (1,1), which is above 2.

But the sequence should be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...

After 2, next is 3. Where is 3 placed? If it's at (1,1), then above 2.

Then next 4 should be left of 3, so at (0,1).

Then next 5 should be left of 4, so at (-1,1).

Then next 6 should be down from 5, so at (-1,0).

Then next 7 down from 6, so at (-1,-1).

Then next 8 right from 7, so at (0,-1).

Then next 9 right from 8, so at (1,-1).

But in the grid, it shows at bottom: 7,8,9, which matches (-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1).

Top:5,4,3 at (-1,1),(0,1),(1,1).

Center:6 at (-1,0),1 at (0,0),2 at (1,0).

Perfect. So the spiral is: start at (0,0)=1, move right to (1,0)=2, then move up to (1,1)=3, then left to (0,1)=4, left to (-1,1)=5, then down to (-1,0)=6, down to (-1,-1)=7, then right to (0,-1)=8, right to (1,-1)=9, and so on.

Now, the direction changes: after placing 2, it turns up to place 3; after 3, it turns left to place 4; after 4, left to 5; after 5, it turns down to place 6; after 6, down to 7; after 7, it turns right to place 8; after 8, right to 9; then next would be up? But above 9 is (1,0)=2, which is already filled, so it should turn left or something. After 9, it should go up to (1,0) but it's occupied, so it turns left to place 10 at (0,-1)? But (0,-1) is already 8. Mistake.

After placing 9 at (1,-1), the next move: typically, it tries to continue in the same direction if possible, but since it's at the edge, or based on neighbors.

After placing a number, if the cell in the "forward" direction is free, it moves there, else it turns left (or right, depending on convention).

In this case, after placing 9 at (1,-1), it was moving right. Next forward would be (2,-1). Since no number there, it should place 10 at (2,-1)? But in our grid, we don't have that, but logically, yes.

Then 11 at (2,0)? But (2,0) is free? After 10 at (2,-1), then moving right? Direction was right, forward is (3,-1), but typically, after moving in a direction, when it hits a point where it can't go further or based on left neighbor.

Standard spiral: after placing a number, it checks if the cell to the left (relative to direction) is free; if not, it moves forward, else it turns left.

I need to recall the exact rule.

From the sequence: after 1 at (0,0), move east to place 2 at (1,0).

Then, since it can turn left (north), it turns north to place 3 at (1,1).

Then, from (1,1), direction north, can it turn left? Left would be west, and cell (0,1) is free, so it should turn west? But in our case, it went west to (0,1)=4.

Then from (0,1), direction west, can it turn left? Left would be south, but cell (0,0) is occupied, so it moves forward west to (-1,1)=5.

Then from (-1,1), direction west, can it turn left? Left is south, cell (-1,0) is free? Yes, so it turns south to (-1,0)=6.

But in our earlier, it went down to (-1,0)=6, which is correct.

Then from (-1,0), direction south, can it turn left? Left is east, cell (0,0) occupied? No, cell to the east is (0,0), but direction is south, so moving south to (-1,-1).

After placing 6 at (-1,0), direction is south. Now, can it turn left? Left would be east. But relative to direction.

When moving south, left is east. The cell to the east is (0,0), which is occupied (by 1), so it cannot turn left? But typically, it should move forward if forward is free.

Forward is south to (-1,-1), which is free, so it moves there to place 7.

Then from (-1,-1), direction south, can it turn left? Left is east, cell (0,-1) is free, so it turns east to (0,-1)=8.

Then from (0,-1), direction east, can it turn left? Left is north, cell (0,0) occupied, so move forward east to (1,-1)=9.

Then from (1,-1), direction east, can it turn left? Left is north, cell (1,0) is occupied (by 2), so move forward east to (2,-1)=10.

Then from (2,-1), direction east, can it turn left? Left is north, cell (2,0) is free, so turn north to (2,0)=11.

And so on.

But in our initial grid, we have up to 9, so next is 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), etc.

But for now, we have the layout.

Now, I need to find where 2026 is located, and then find its eight neighbors and sum them.

So, first, I need a way to find the coordinates of a given number n in this spiral.

Since the spiral is symmetric, I can find which "layer" or "ring" it is in.

Notice that the spiral forms concentric squares.

The center is 1.

Then the first ring around it: numbers 2 to 9? 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. That's 8 numbers.

1 is at layer 0, or ring 0.

Ring k for k>=1 contains numbers from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2? Let's see.

For k=1: ring 1 should contain numbers from 2 to 9? But (2*1-1)^2 =1^2=1, so from 2 to (2*1+1)^2=3^2=9? Yes, 2 to 9 inclusive.

Number of elements: 9-2+1=8, which is 8*1? For ring k, the side length is 2k+1? The ring has numbers from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

For k=1: (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1+1=2 to (2*1+1)^2=9, yes.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

The first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

The size of ring k: number of numbers is [(2k+1)^2] - [(2k-1)^2] = (4k^2 +4k +1) - (4k^2 -4k +1) = 8k.

Yes, 8k numbers in ring k.

Now, ring k corresponds to numbers where the "distance" from center is k.

In terms of max(|x|,|y|), since it's a square spiral.

The coordinates, the max of |x| and |y| is exactly the ring number k.

For example, ring k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, numbers 2 to 9: positions like (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1). All have max(|x|,|y|)=1.

Similarly, for center, max=0.

Now, for a given n, I need to find the smallest k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

Since the last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

So, find k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n and (2k-1)^2 < n.

More precisely, ring k contains n if (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

For example, n=1: (2*0+1)^2=1, but k starts from 0? For center, k=0.

Define ring k for k>=0.

Ring 0: just 1, at (0,0).

Ring k for k>=1: from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

But for k=1: from 2 to 9, as above.

Now, for n=1, it's ring 0.

For n>1, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Set m = floor(sqrt(n-1)) or something.

Set L_k = (2k+1)^2, the last number of ring k.

F_k = first number of ring k = L_{k-1} +1 for k>=1, with L_0=1.

L_k = (2k+1)^2.

For ring k, first number is L_{k-1} +1 = (2(k-1)+1)^2 +1 = (2k-1)^2 +1.

Last number is (2k+1)^2.

For a given n, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Since (2k+1)^2 is the upper bound.

k is the smallest integer such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

Set r = floor(sqrt(n)), but need to adjust.

Note that the ring index k can be found by k = ceil( (sqrt(n) - 1)/2 ) or something.

Set m = floor(sqrt(n))

Then, if m is odd, say m=2k+1, then n is in ring k, since last number is m^2.

But if m is even, then it might be different.

For example, n=1: sqrt(1)=1, odd, m=1=2*0+1, so k=0.

n=2: sqrt(2)≈1.414, floor=1, odd, m=1=2*0+1, k=0? But should be ring 1.

Problem.

n=2: (2k-1)^2 < 2 <= (2k+1)^2.

For k=1: (2-1)^2=1<2<=9, yes.

But m=floor(sqrt(2))=1, which is odd, but k should be 1, not 0.

So perhaps k = ceil( sqrt(n) / 2 ) or something.

Set s = ceil( sqrt(n) )

Then if s odd, k = (s-1)/2, but for n=1, s=1, k=(1-1)/2=0.

n=2, s=ceil(sqrt(2))=2? ceil(1.414)=2, which is even.

n=3, s=2.

n=4, s=2.

n=5, s=3? sqrt(5)≈2.236, ceil=3.

n=9, s=3.

n=10, s=4? sqrt(10)≈3.162, ceil=4.

Now, for ring k, last number is (2k+1)^2, which is odd.

The ring starts after (2k-1)^2.

So for given n, find smallest k such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

k = ceil( (sqrt(n) - 1)/2 )

Compute for n=1: (1-1)/2=0, ceil=0.

n=2: (1.414-1)/2≈0.414/2=0.207, ceil=1? Yes.

n=3: (1.732-1)/2≈0.732/2=0.366, ceil=1.

n=4: (2-1)/2=1/2=0.5, ceil=1.

n=5: (2.236-1)/2≈1.236/2=0.618, ceil=1.

n=9: (3-1)/2=1, ceil=1.

n=10: (3.162-1)/2≈2.162/2=1.081, ceil=2? Should be ring 2? Last of ring1 is9, so ring2 starts at10? Yes, from10 to25? (2*2+1)^2=5^2=25.

Yes.

n=25: (5-1)/2=4/2=2, ceil=2.

But last of ring2 is25, so should be included in ring2.

k=2.

n=26: (5.099-1)/2≈4.099/2=2.0495, ceil=3? But ring3 starts at26? Last of ring2 is25, so ring3 from26 to (7)^2=49.

k should be3.

Formula k = ceil( (sqrt(n) - 1)/2 ) gives for n=26: sqrt(26)≈5.099, minus1=4.099, divide by 2=2.0495, ceil=3, yes.

n=25: sqrt(25)=5, minus1=4, div2=2, ceil=2, correct.

n=1:0, good.

n=2: as above,1.

So k = ceil( (sqrt(n) - 1)/2 )

Now, once I have k, I know that n is in ring k.

The ring has 8k numbers.

The first number in the ring is a_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

Last number is b_k = (2k+1)^2

Now, within the ring, the numbers are placed in order.

The ring has four sides: right, top, left, bottom.

Each side has how many numbers? Since total 8k, and four sides, but corners are shared? No, in this spiral, each side has exactly 2k numbers? Let's see.

For ring k, the side length: from max(|x|,|y|)=k, so the square has size (2k+1) by (2k+1), but the ring is the outer layer, so it has the perimeter.

The perimeter of a square of side s is 4(s-1), but here side s=2k+1.

The inner square is size (2k-1) by (2k-1), so the outer ring has size (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = 8k, as before.

Now, the four sides: without corners, each side would have (2k+1) - 2 = 2k -1 elements? But corners are included.

Total corners: 4 corners.

Each side between corners has (2k+1) - 2 = 2k -1 elements? Side length in terms of cells.

For example, k=1: side length 3 cells per side.

Ring: positions like for x=k=1, y from -1 to 1? Earlier: (1,-1),(1,0),(1,1) for right side? But (1,0) and (1,1) are corners? In a square, corners are where |x|=k and |y|=k.

So for ring k, the four sides:

- Right side: x=k, |y| < k? But includes corners.

Typically, we traverse: starting from the bottom-right? In our earlier placement.

For ring k, it starts at the bottom-right corner? Let's see for k=1.

Ring k=1: numbers 2 to 9.

Starts at (1,0)=2? But (1,0) is not a corner; corners are (1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1).

In our sequence: after ring 0 (1), we start ring 1 at (1,0)=2, which is on the right side, but not corner.

Then move up to (1,1)=3, which is top-right corner.

Then left to (0,1)=4, then (-1,1)=5, top-left corner.

Then down to (-1,0)=6, then (-1,-1)=7, bottom-left corner.

Then right to (0,-1)=8, then (1,-1)=9, bottom-right corner.

So the order is: start at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

For k=1, start at (1,0) = (k, 0) = (k, -(k-1)? -(1-1)=0, yes.

Then move up to (1,1)=(k,k), corner.

Then left to (0,1), then (-1,1)=(-k,k), corner.

Then down to (-1,0), then (-1,-1)=(-k,-k), corner.

Then right to (0,-1), then (1,-1)=(k,-k), corner.

So the sequence: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k), then to (-k,k), then to (-k,-k), then to (k,-k).

The segments:

- From (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k): this is moving up along x=k, from y= -(k-1) to y=k.

The y-coordinates: from -(k-1) to k, which is a range of k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1, but number of steps: from y=a to y=b, number of points is |b-a|+1.

From y= -(k-1) to y=k, difference in y: k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1.

Number of integers from -(k-1) to k inclusive is [k - (-(k-1))] + 1 = (k + k -1) +1 = 2k.

But this includes both ends. For k=1: from y=0 to y=1, points y=0 and y=1, two points: (1,0) and (1,1). But in sequence, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, so two numbers.

But earlier we have corners included.

In this segment, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) and ends at (k,k), which is a corner.

Similarly, next segment: from (k,k) to (-k,k), moving left along y=k, from x=k to x=-k.

x from k to -k, difference |k - (-k)| = 2k, number of points: from k to -k inclusive? But that would be 2k+1 points, too many.

In our case for k=1: from (1,1) to (-1,1), moving left: (1,1)=3, then (0,1)=4, then (-1,1)=5. So three points? But k=1, 2k+1? No.

x from 1 to -1, step -1, points x=1,0,-1. Number: 3, which is 2k+1? k=1, 3.

But earlier segment had 2 points.

Inconsistency.

For the right side: when moving up, it includes the start but not the end? No.

In the sequence: from (1,0) to (1,1): two points, but (1,1) is corner.

Then from (1,1) to (-1,1): moving left, points (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), three points.

But (1,1) is shared, so total unique points.

To avoid double-counting, we consider the sides excluding the starting corner but including ending corner or something.

In terms of the path, it visits each cell once.

For ring k, total cells 8k.

The four sides: each side has how many cells?

For a square ring, each side has (2k+1) cells, but corners are shared, so total 4*(2k+1) - 4 = 8k +4 -4=8k, yes.

Each side has exactly 2k+1 cells? For k=1, 2*1+1=3 cells per side? But earlier right side: (1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)? But in our sequence, for k=1, the right side has (1,-1)=9, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3? But they are not consecutive in the sequence.

In the traversal order, it's not per side; it's traversed in order.

For positioning, it's better to find where in the ring it is.

The ring starts at (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k) since -(k-1)=1-k.

For k=1: (1,0).

Then it moves up for how many steps? From y=1-k to y=k.

For k=1: y=0 to y=1, so moves up 1 step? But it places two numbers: at start and after move.

The displacement: from start to end of first segment: from (k,1-k) to (k,k), so delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1.

Number of moves: 2k-1? But number of cells: since it starts at one cell and moves 2k-1 times? No.

The number of cells in the first segment: from (k,1-k) to (k,k), inclusive.

y-coordinates: from 1-k to k.

The values: min y=1-k, max y=k, number of integers: k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1: y=0 to 1, numbers 0,1, two cells.

For k=2: ring k=2, first number: a_k = (2*2-1)^2 +1 = 9 +1=10.

Position: (k,1-k)=(2,1-2)=(2,-1).

Then moves up to (2,2)? End at (k,k)=(2,2).

y from -1 to 2, values -1,0,1,2, four cells? 2k=4.

Numbers: 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (2,0)? Earlier we said after 9 at (1,-1), next is 10 at (2,-1), then 11 at (2,0)? Then 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2)? But (2,2) is corner.

Then next segment: move left to (-2,2)? From (2,2) to (-2,2), along y=2.

x from 2 to -2, values 2,1,0,-1,-2? Five cells? But 2k+1? k=2, 5.

Numbers: 13 at (2,2), then 14 at (1,2)? Then 15 at (0,2), 16 at (-1,2), 17 at (-2,2).

Then down to (-2,-2)? From (-2,2) to (-2,-2), y from 2 to -2, values 2,1,0,-1,-2, five cells: 17 at (-2,2), 18 at (-2,1), 19 at (-2,0), 20 at (-2,-1), 21 at (-2,-2).

Then right to (2,-2)? From (-2,-2) to (2,-2), x from -2 to 2, values -2,-1,0,1,2, five cells: 21 at (-2,-2), 22 at (-1,-2), 23 at (0,-2), 24 at (1,-2), 25 at (2,-2).

But ring should end at 25, which is (2,-2), but earlier start was (2,-1), and (2,-2) is different.

Total numbers: from 10 to 25, 16 numbers, 8k=16 for k=2.

Segments: first segment: right side, moving up: from (2,-1) to (2,2): y=-1,0,1,2: four cells: 10,11,12,13.

But 13 at (2,2).

Second segment: top side, moving left: from (2,2) to (-2,2): x=2,1,0,-1,-2: five cells? But 13 is already placed, so it should start from next.

In the path, after placing 13 at (2,2), it moves left to place next number.

So next is at (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17.

So cells: (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2). Four cells? But x from 1 to -2, but (2,2) is already done, so it starts from x=1 down to x=-2.

x-coordinates: 1,0,-1,-2. Four values, so four cells: 14,15,16,17.

But for k=2, 2k=4, same as first segment.

First segment had y from -1 to 2, but excluding the start? No, it included (2,-1) and (2,2).

y-values: -1,0,1,2: four points.

Second segment: from (2,2) to (-2,2), but since (2,2) is already occupied, it moves to (1,2), then to (0,2), etc., down to (-2,2), so x=1,0,-1,-2? But (-2,2) is included, and x decreases from 1 to -2, step -1, so x=1,0,-1,-2: four cells.

But earlier I said five, but no, since it doesn't include x=2 because it's already placed.

Similarly, third segment: from (-2,2) to (-2,-2). After placing 17 at (-2,2), it moves down to (-2,1), etc.

y from 2 to -2, but y=2 is already done, so y=1,0,-1,-2: four cells: (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21.

Fourth segment: from (-2,-2) to (2,-2). After 21 at (-2,-2), move right to (-1,-2), etc.

x from -2 to 2, but x=-2 done, so x=-1,0,1,2: four cells: (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25.

Perfect. So each of the four segments has exactly 2k cells? For k=2, 4 cells each.

But total 4 * 4 =16, yes.

For k=1: each segment should have 2*1=2 cells.

First segment: right side, up: from (1,0) to (1,1): (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3. Two cells.

Second segment: top side, left: from (1,1) to (-1,1)? But (1,1) done, so to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5. Two cells? x=0,-1? But for k=1, should be two cells: (0,1) and (-1,1).

Third segment: left side, down: from (-1,1) to (-1,-1)? Done (-1,1), so to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7. Two cells.

Fourth segment: bottom side, right: from (-1,-1) to (1,-1)? Done (-1,-1), so to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9. Two cells.

Yes, each segment has 2k cells.

The segments are:

1. Right side: moving up: x=k, y from 1-k to k. But in order, from y=1-k to y=k, inclusive, and since it's moving up, y increases.

Number of cells: as above, 2k cells? For k=1, y from 0 to 1, two cells; k=2, y from -1 to 2, but -1,0,1,2, four cells, yes 2k.

The y-values: min y=1-k, max y=k, and since k>=1, 1-k <= k, and the values are consecutive integers from 1-k to k inclusive.

Number: k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 + k +1 = 2k, yes.

Similarly for other sides.

The segments in order:

- Segment 1: right side: x=k, y from 1-k to k. Direction: increasing y.

- Segment 2: top side: y=k, x from k-1 down to -k? In our case, for segment 2: moving left, so decreasing x.

x from k-1 to -k? For k=1: x from 0 to -1? But we had x=0,-1.

k-1=0, -k=-1, so from k-1 down to -k inclusive.

Values: for k=1: x=0,-1.

k=2: x=1,0,-1,-2? But earlier we had x=1,0,-1,-2? -k=-2, k-1=1, so from 1 to -2, but decreasing, so x=1,0,-1,-2. But earlier I said for segment 2: (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2), yes x=1,0,-1,-2? k=2, x from k-1=1 to -k=-2, decreasing.

But -k = -2, and it includes -2, which is corner.

Number: from k-1 to -k, decreasing, number of integers: |k-1 - (-k)| +1 = |k-1 +k| +1 = |2k-1| +1, since k>=1, 2k-1+1=2k. Yes.

Similarly, segment 3: left side: x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k? Moving down, decreasing y.

For k=1: y from 0 to -1? Values y=0,-1? But earlier (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, so y=0,-1.

Min y= -k = -1, max y=k-1=0? So from k-1 down to -k: 0 down to -1.

For k=2: y from 1 to -2? Earlier: (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2), so y=1,0,-1,-2. From k-1=1 to -k=-2, decreasing.

Number: 2k.

Segment 4: bottom side: y=-k, x from -k+1 to k? Moving right, increasing x.

For k=1: y=-1, x from -0? -k+1=0? Earlier (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, so x=0,1.

From -k+1 = -1+1=0 to k=1.

For k=2: y=-2, x from -2+1=-1 to 2? Earlier (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25, so x=-1,0,1,2. From -k+1=-1 to k=2.

Number: from -k+1 to k, increasing, number: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

Perfect.

So, summary for ring k:

- Segment 1 (right): x=k, y from 1-k to k (increasing)

- Segment 2 (top): y=k, x from k-1 down to -k (decreasing)

- Segment 3 (left): x=-k, y from k-1 down to -k (decreasing)

- Segment 4 (bottom): y=-k, x from -k+1 to k (increasing)

Each segment has exactly 2k cells.

The first cell of the ring is at segment 1, position (k, 1-k)

The index within the ring: let p = n - a_k + 1, where a_k = first number = (2k-1)^2 + 1

So p ranges from 1 to 8k.

Now, segment 1: p from 1 to 2k

Segment 2: p from 2k+1 to 4k

Segment 3: p from 4k+1 to 6k

Segment 4: p from 6k+1 to 8k

Now, within each segment, we can find the coordinates.

For segment 1: x=k, y starts at 1-k and increases to k.

The y-value: when p=1, y=1-k

p=2, y=1-k +1? Since moving up, each step increases y by 1.

The y-coordinate: initial y_min = 1-k

After m steps, y = (1-k) + (m-1) ? When p=1, y=1-k

p=2, y=1-k +1

...

p=j, y= (1-k) + (j-1)

For j from 1 to 2k.

When j=1, y=1-k

j=2k, y=1-k + (2k-1) = 1-k+2k-1=k, yes.

So for segment 1: x=k, y= (1-k) + (p - 1)

Similarly, for segment 2: y=k, x decreases from k-1 to -k.

Initial x_max = k-1

When p=2k+1 (first of seg2), x=k-1

Then decreases by 1 each step.

So for index within segment: let q = p - 2k, so q from 1 to 2k.

Then x = (k-1) - (q - 1) ? When q=1, x=k-1

q=2, x=k-2

...

q=2k, x=k-1 - (2k-1) = k-1-2k+1= -k, yes.

So x = (k-1) - (q - 1) = k - q? Since q-1 is the step.

x = k - 1 - (q - 1) = k - q

q from 1 to 2k, so x = k - q

When q=1, x=k-1

q=2, x=k-2

...

q=2k, x=k-2k= -k, good.

y=k.

Segment 3: x=-k, y decreases from k-1 to -k.

p from 4k+1 to 6k, so q = p - 4k, from 1 to 2k.

Initial y_max = k-1

Decreases, so y = (k-1) - (q - 1) = k - q? Same as before.

When q=1, y=k-1

q=2, y=k-2

...

q=2k, y=k-2k= -k, good.

x=-k.

Segment 4: y=-k, x increases from -k+1 to k.

p from 6k+1 to 8k, q = p - 6k, from 1 to 2k.

Initial x_min = -k+1

Increases by 1 each step.

So x = (-k+1) + (q - 1) = -k + q? 

q=1, x=-k+1

q=2, x=-k+2

...

q=2k, x=-k + 2k = k, good.

y=-k.

So, to summarize:

Given n, find k = ceil( (sqrt(n) - 1)/2 )

Then a_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1

p = n - a_k + 1  (so p=1 to 8k)

Now, if p <= 2k, segment 1: x=k, y= (1-k) + (p - 1)

Else if p <= 4k, segment 2: q = p - 2k, x = k - q, y = k

Else if p <= 6k, segment 3: q = p - 4k, x = -k, y = k - q

Else if p <= 8k, segment 4: q = p - 6k, x = -k + q, y = -k

Now, I need to find the neighbors of n=2026.

First, find k for n=2026.

k = ceil( (sqrt(2026) - 1)/2 )

First, compute sqrt(2026).

2025 = 45^2 = 2025, since 40^2=1600, 50^2=2500, 45^2=2025.

2026 > 2025, so sqrt(2026) ≈ 45 + 1/(2*45) = 45 + 1/90 ≈ 45.01111...

More accurately, (45.01)^2 = 45^2 + 2*45*0.01 + (0.01)^2 = 2025 + 0.9 + 0.0001 = 2025.9001

2026 - 2025.9001 = 0.0999, so need a bit more.

Set s = sqrt(2026), s^2 = 2026

s ≈ 45 + d, d small.

(45 + d)^2 = 2025 + 90d + d^2 = 2026

90d + d^2 =1

d ≈ 1/90 ≈ 0.011111, but d^2 negligible, so s ≈ 45.011111...

More precisely, 90d ≈1, d≈1/90≈0.011111, d^2≈0.000123, so 90d + d^2 ≈ 90*(1/90) + (1/90)^2 ≈1 + 0.000123, but we need 1, so slightly less.

Set 90d + d^2 =1

d = [ -90 + sqrt(8100 + 4) ] / 2 ≈ [ -90 + sqrt(8104) ] / 2

sqrt(8104): 90^2=8100, 90.02^2=8103.6004? 90.01^2=8101.8001, 90.02^2=8103.6004, 90.03^2=8105.4009, too big.

8104 - 8100 =4, so sqrt(8104)≈90 + 4/(2*90) =90 + 4/180≈90 + 1/45≈90.02222

Then d≈ [ -90 + 90.02222 ] / 2 ≈ 0.02222 / 2 ≈ 0.011111

Same as before.

90d + d^2 =90*(1/90) + (1/90)^2=1 + 1/8100≈1.000123>1, so d slightly less.

Set d=1/90 - e, but perhaps compute s=sqrt(2026)≈45.0111107 or something.

But for ceiling, we need the value.

k = ceil( (s - 1)/2 ) with s=sqrt(2026)

s ≈ 45.011111

s - 1 ≈ 44.011111

(s - 1)/2 ≈ 22.0055555

ceil of that is 23? Since 22.0055, ceiling is 23? Ceiling is smallest integer greater than or equal.

22.0055, greater than 22, so ceil is 23? But 23 is greater than 22.0055? No, 22.0055 is between 22 and 23, so ceil is 23? Ceiling of x is smallest integer >= x. For x=22.0055, it is greater than 22, less than 23, so smallest integer >= x is 23? No, 22 is less than x? 22 < 22.0055, but 22 is not greater than or equal? Ceiling is smallest integer not less than x, so for x=22.0055, integers not less than x are 23,24,... but 22 is less than x? 22 < 22.0055, so not >= x. 23 > x, but is there an integer between? No, so smallest integer >= x is 23? But that can't be, because 22 < x < 23, so ceiling should be 23? But intuitively, since it's greater than 22, but ceiling to next integer.

For example, ceil(22.1)=23? No, ceil(22.1) is 23? Mistake.

Ceil(22.1): smallest integer >=22.1 is 23? No, 22 is less than 22.1? 22 < 22.1, so not >=, next is 23>22.1, but 22.1 is greater than 22, but 22 is not >=22.1, so yes, ceil(22.1)=23? That can't be right.

I think I confuse with floor.

Floor of 22.1 is 22, ceil is 23? No, ceil(22.1) should be 23? But 22.1 is closer to 22, but ceil is the smallest integer greater than or equal, so for 22.1, 22<22.1, so not >=, 23>22.1, so yes, ceil(22.1)=23? But that is wrong because ceil(22.1) is 23 only if it's ceiling to next integer, but standard definition: ceil(22.1) is 23? No, I think I have a mistake.

Recall: for example, ceil(2.3)=3? No, ceil(2.3) is 3? That doesn't make sense. Ceil(2.3) should be 3? But 2.3 is between 2 and 3, smallest integer >=2.3 is 3? But 2 is less than 2.3, so not >=, 3>2.3, so yes? But that is incorrect because ceil(2.3) is 3 only if it's rounding up, but in mathematics, ceil(x) for x not integer is the next integer up.

But for x=2.3, ceil(x)=3? No, I think I am confusing.

Standard definition: ceil(2.3) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.3. Since 2<2.3<3, and 2 is not >=2.3, 3 is >=2.3, so yes, ceil(2.3)=3.

But that seems counterintuitive; I thought ceil was for ceiling function, but yes, for example ceil(2.0)=2, ceil(2.1)=3? No, ceil(2.1) should be 3? But that can't be; I think I have a fundamental mistake.

Ceil(2.1): integers greater than or equal to 2.1 are 3,4,5,... but 2 is not greater than or equal to 2.1? 2 < 2.1, so 2 is not >=2.1, so the smallest integer >=2.1 is 3? But that is wrong because 3 is greater than 2.1, but 2 is less, but is there an integer between? No, but intuitively, for 2.1, ceiling should be 3 only if we are rounding up, but mathematically, ceil(2.1) is 3? No, I think I recall now: ceil(2.1) is 3? Let me calculate.

For example, ceil(1.5) is 2, because 2 is the smallest integer >=1.5.

Ceil(2) =2.

Ceil(2.0001)=3? No, ceil(2.0001) should be 3? That can't be; it should be 3 only if it's greater than 2, but 2.0001 is greater than 2, so smallest integer >=2.0001 is 3? But 2 is less than 2.0001, so not >=, so yes, it would be 3, but that is absurd because 2.0001 is very close to 2.

I think I have a confusion. Let me think: for x=2.0001, is there an integer that is >= x? Yes, 3,4,5,... but also 2? 2 < 2.0001, so 2 is not greater than or equal to 2.0001? Greater than or equal means >=, and 2 < 2.0001, so 2 is not >= 2.0001. The next integer is 3 > 2.0001, so ceil(2.0001) = 3? But that is incorrect; it should be 3 only if it's greater than 2, but for example ceil(2.0) =2, but for 2.0001, it should be 3? That doesn't make sense.

I see the mistake: for x=2.0001, the integer 2 is less than x, so not >= x. The integer 3 is greater than x, so it is >= x. But is there an integer between 2 and 3? No, so the smallest integer >= x is 3? But that is wrong because 2 is an integer, and 2 < x, but for x=2, ceil(x)=2, for x>2, if x is not integer, ceil(x) is the next integer up, so for x=2.0001, ceil(x) = 3? But that is not standard.

Let me check with a known value. Take n=2. For n=2, k = ceil( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ) ≈ (1.414-1)/2=0.414/2=0.207, ceil=1, which is correct, ring 1.

n=3: same, k=1.

n=4: (2-1)/2=0.5, ceil=1.

n=5: (2.236-1)/2=1.236/2=0.618, ceil=1.

n=9: (3-1)/2=1, ceil=1.

n=10: (3.162-1)/2=2.162/2=1.081, ceil=2, correct.

Now for n=2026, s=sqrt(2026)≈45.011111, s-1≈44.011111, (s-1)/2≈22.0055555.

Now, is this greater than 22? Yes. Is it less than 23? Yes. So ceil is 23? But for n=2025, which is 45^2=2025.

n=2025, s=45, s-1=44, (s-1)/2=22, ceil=22.

Now, which ring? (2k+1)^2 for k=22: (44+1)^2=45^2=2025, so last number of ring k=22 is 2025.

So n=2025 is in ring 22.

n=2026 is the next number, so should be in ring 23? Because ring 23 starts at (2*23-1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Exactly! So a_{23} = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

So n=2026 is the first number of ring k=23.

Perfect. So k=23.

Now, a_k = a_{23} = 2026

p = n - a_k + 1 = 2026 - 2026 + 1 = 1

So p=1.

Now, since p=1 <= 2k = 2*23=46, so segment 1.

Segment 1: x=k=23

y = (1-k) + (p - 1) = (1-23) + (1 - 1) = (-22) + 0 = -22

So coordinates (x,y) = (23, -22)

Now, I need the eight neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors are at:

(x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), (x-1,y-1)

So, for (23,-22):

- Right: (24,-22)

- Left: (22,-22)

- Up: (23,-21)

- Down: (23,-23)

- Up-right: (24,-21)

- Down-right: (24,-23)

- Up-left: (22,-21)

- Down-left: (22,-23)

Now, I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since the spiral is symmetric, and we have the mapping from position to number.

So, for each neighbor, I need to find the number at that coordinate.

Note that the center is (0,0), and numbers increase outward.

The ring number for a point (x,y) is m = max(|x|, |y|)

Because as we saw earlier, for a cell, its ring is max(|x|,|y|).

For example, (23,-22), |x|=23, |y|=22, max=23, so ring k=23.

Similarly, for neighbors:

- (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24, so ring 24

- (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, ring 22

- (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23, ring 23

- (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23

- (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24, ring 24

- (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24, ring 24

- (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, ring 22

- (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23? |y|=23>22, so max=23, ring 23

Let me list:

Neighbor | |x| | |y| | max | ring k

(24,-22) | 24 | 22 | 24 | 24

(22,-22) | 22 | 22 | 22 | 22

(23,-21) | 23 | 21 | 23 | 23

(23,-23) | 23 | 23 | 23 | 23

(24,-21) | 24 | 21 | 24 | 24

(24,-23) | 24 | 23 | 24 | 24

(22,-21) | 22 | 21 | 22 | 22? max(22,21)=22

(22,-23) | 22 | 23 | 23 | 23? max(22,23)=23

So rings: two neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Three neighbors in ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)? (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, yes.

And three neighbors in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

List:

Ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

Ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

Ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

(22,-21) is ring 22, since max(22,21)=22.

(22,-23) is ring 23, since max(22,23)=23.

Now, total eight neighbors: two in ring 22, three in ring 23, three in ring 24? 2+3+3=8, yes.

But our point is at (23,-22), which is ring 23, and neighbors include same ring and adjacent rings.

Now, I need to find the number at each of these positions.

So, for each coordinate, I can compute the number using the same mapping.

Given a coordinate (x,y), find its ring m = max(|x|, |y|)

Then, depending on the position, find which segment it is in, and then the index.

Since we have the ring m, and the position relative to the ring.

The ring m has first number a_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Then, we need to find where (x,y) is located in the ring.

The ring is divided into four segments as before.

For ring m:

- Segment 1: right side: x=m, y from 1-m to m

- Segment 2: top side: y=m, x from m-1 down to -m? But x decreasing.

To determine which segment:

- If x = m and |y| < m? But includes corners? Earlier we have specific ranges.

From earlier definition:

- If x = m and y >= 1-m and y <= m, but since max(|x|,|y|)=m, and x=m, then |y| <= m, so y from -m to m, but in segment 1, y from 1-m to m.

Note that for segment 1: x=m, y >= 1-m and y <= m, but since |y| <= m always when max is m, but the range is y from 1-m to m, which for m>=1, 1-m <= m, and includes y=1-m to y=m.

But y could be from -m to m, but segment 1 only covers part of it.

Specifically, for x=m, it is only in segment 1 if y >= 1-m and y <= m.

But since |y| <= m, and m>=1, 1-m <=0, -m <=1-m? -m <= 1-m always? For example m=1: y from 0 to 1, but y could be -1, which is not included.

Similarly, for m=2: segment 1: y from -1 to 2, but the full right side would be y from -2 to 2? But in ring m=2, the right side is x=2, y from -2 to 2? But earlier for segment 1, we had y from -1 to 2? For m=2, segment 1: x=2, y from 1-2=-1 to 2, so y=-1,0,1,2.

But the full x=2 should include y=-2? But y=-2 is in segment 4, since bottom side.

So yes, for a given (x,y), we need to classify which segment it belongs to in its ring m.

The conditions:

- Segment 1: x = m and y >= 1-m

- But also, since it's the right side, and we have the range.

Note that segment 1 covers x=m, y from 1-m to m.

Segment 2 covers y=m, x from -m to m-1? Earlier: for segment 2: y=m, x from k-1 down to -k, i.e., x from -m to m-1? For ring m, segment 2: y=m, x from m-1 down to -m, so x <= m-1 and x >= -m.

But since y=m, and max(|x|,|y|)=m, so |x| <= m, so x from -m to m.

Segment 2: x from -m to m-1? Earlier: for segment 2, x from k-1 down to -k, so for k=m, x from m-1 down to -m, so x = m-1, m-2, ..., -m.

So x <= m-1 and x >= -m.

Similarly, segment 3: x=-m, y from k-1 down to -k, i.e., y from m-1 down to -m, so y <= m-1 and y >= -m.

Segment 4: y=-m, x from -k+1 to k, i.e., x from -m+1 to m, so x >= -m+1 and x <= m.

Now, the corners: for example, (m,m): x=m, y=m. Now, segment 1: x=m, y>=1-m, y<=m, so y=m is included. Segment 2: y=m, x>= -m, x<=m-1? But x=m is not <= m-1? Since m-1 < m, so x=m not included in segment 2. So (m,m) is only in segment 1? But earlier for k=1, (1,1) is in segment 1? Yes, for k=1, segment 1: (1,0),(1,1), so (1,1) is included.

Similarly, (m,-m): segment 4? For segment 4: y=-m, x>= -m+1, x<=m. So if x=m, y=-m, it satisfies segment 4? But also segment 1? Segment 1 requires y>=1-m, for m>=1, 1-m <=0, -m <=1-m? Since -m < 1-m for m>0, so y=-m < 1-m? For example m=1, y=-1, 1-m=0, -1 <0, so not in segment 1. Segment 4: y=-m=-1, x>= -1+1=0, x<=1, so for x=1,y=-1, it is included. Similarly, (-m,m) in segment 2? Segment 2: y=m, x>= -m, x<=m-1. For x=-m, y=m, x=-m >= -m, but x=-m <= m-1? For m=1, -1 <=0? Yes, so included. (-m,-m) in segment 3? Segment 3: x=-m, y>= -m, y<=m-1? For y=-m, x=-m, y=-m >= -m, but y<=m-1? For m=1, -1<=0? Yes. So corners are covered: (m,m) in seg1, (-m,m) in seg2, (-m,-m) in seg3, (m,-m) in seg4.

Now for our neighbors, we need to compute for each.

First, list the neighbors and their rings and segments.

We have:

1. (24,-22): ring m=24

2. (22,-22): ring m=22

3. (23,-21): ring m=23

4. (23,-23): ring m=23

5. (24,-21): ring m=24

6. (24,-23): ring m=24

7. (22,-21): ring m=22

8. (22,-23): ring m=23

Now, for each, find the segment and then the index.

Start with ring 22 neighbors: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, (22,-22): x=22, y=-22

Ring m=22

Now, which segment?

- Segment 1: x=m=22, y >= 1-m =1-22=-21? y=-22 >= -21? -22 < -21, no.

- Segment 2: y=m=22? y=-22 ≠22, no.

- Segment 3: x=-m? x=22 ≠ -22, no.

- Segment 4: y=-m? y=-22, and m=22, so y=-22 = -m? Yes. Now, segment 4 requires y=-m, and x >= -m+1 = -22+1=-21, and x <= m=22.

x=22, which is >= -21 and <=22, yes.

So in segment 4.

Segment 4: for ring m, y=-m, x from -m+1 to m.

In this case, x=22, y=-22.

Within segment 4, the x-coordinate: as earlier, x = -m + q, where q is the index in the segment.

From earlier: for segment 4: x = -m + q, y = -m, with q from 1 to 2m.

When q=1, x= -m +1

q=2m, x= -m + 2m = m

Here x=22, m=22, so -m + q = -22 + q =22? So q=44.

Since q=2m when x=m.

q=2m=44.

Now, the first number of ring m is a_m = (2m-1)^2 +1

For m=22, a_{22} = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

The segment 4 corresponds to p from 6m+1 to 8m, since segment 4 is last.

Earlier: segment 4: p from 6m+1 to 8m

Within segment, q = p - 6m

x = -m + q

Here x = -22 + q = 22? So q=44

Then p - 6m = q =44

So p = 6m + q = 6*22 + 44 = 132 + 44 = 176

p is the index in the ring, from 1 to 8m=176? 8*22=176, so p=176.

Since p ranges from 1 to 8m, and segment 4 is from 6m+1 to 8m, so p=6m+1 to 8m.

Here p=176=8*22, which is the last of the ring.

Now, the number n = a_m + p - 1

a_m is first number, p is index starting from 1, so n = a_m + (p - 1)

Since p=1 corresponds to n=a_m.

So for this point, n = a_{22} + (176 - 1) = 1850 + 175 = 2025

a_{22}=1850, p=176, n=1850 + 176 -1 = 1850 + 175 = 2025.

But 2025 is the last number of ring 22, since (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, yes.

And position: for ring 22, segment 4: when x=m=22, y=-m=-22, which is the bottom-right corner, and since it's the end of the ring, yes, last number.

Now, next neighbor in ring 22: (22,-21)

x=22, y=-21

m=22

Segment? 

- Seg1: x=22, y>=1-22=-21? y=-21 >= -21, yes, and y<=22, yes. So could be seg1.

But also seg4? Seg4 requires y=-m=-22, but y=-21 ≠ -22, so not seg4.

Seg1: x=m=22, y>=1-m=-21, y<=m=22.

y=-21 >= -21, yes, and <=22, so yes, in seg1.

Now, seg1: x=m=22, y= (1-m) + (p - 1) ? Earlier formula.

y = (1-m) + (p - 1)

Here y=-21, m=22, so -21 = (1-22) + (p - 1) = (-21) + (p - 1)

So -21 = -21 + p - 1

Thus p - 1 = 0? So p=1

But p=1 is the first of the ring.

Now, a_m=1850, so n= a_m + p -1 =1850 +1 -1=1850

But is that correct? First number of ring 22 is 1850, at position? Seg1: x=m=22, y=1-m=1-22=-21? So (22,-21)

Yes, exactly. So n=1850.

Now, next, neighbors in ring 23.

First, (23,-21): x=23, y=-21

m=23

Seg? 

- Seg1: x=23, y>=1-23=-22? y=-21 >= -22, yes, and y<=23, yes. So seg1.

y= (1-m) + (p-1) = (1-23) + (p-1) = -22 + p -1 = p -23

Set equal to y=-21

So -21 = p - 23

Thus p = -21 + 23 = 2

a_m = a_{23} = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026

n = a_m + p -1 = 2026 + 2 -1 = 2027

Since p=2, n=2026 + (2-1) = 2026 +1 =2027? a_m + (p-1) =2026 +1=2027.

Now, next: (23,-23): x=23, y=-23

m=23

Seg? 

- Seg1: y>=1-23=-22? y=-23 >= -22? -23 < -22, no.

- Seg2: y=m=23? y=-23 ≠23, no.

- Seg3: x=-m? x=23 ≠ -23, no.

- Seg4: y=-m? y=-23, m=23, so y=-23 = -m? Yes. x>= -m+1= -23+1=-22? x=23 >= -22, yes, and <=23, yes. So seg4.

Seg4: x= -m + q = -23 + q

Set to x=23, so -23 + q =23, q=46

q = p - 6m

p = 6m + q = 6*23 + 46 = 138 + 46 = 184

a_m=2026

n= a_m + p -1 = 2026 + 184 -1 = 2026 + 183 = 2209? Let me compute.

2026 + 183 = 2209? 2026 + 180=2206, +3=2209.

But ring 23 last number is (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes, and since q=46=2m? 2*23=46, and p=6m + q=6*23 +46=138+46=184, and 8m=8*23=184, so last number, yes n=2209.

Now, next: (22,-23): x=22, y=-23

m=23? max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,23)=23, yes.

Now, seg?

- Seg1: x=m=23? x=22 ≠23, no.

- Seg2: y=m=23? y=-23 ≠23, no.

- Seg3: x=-m? x=22 ≠ -23, no.

- Seg4: y=-m? y=-23, m=23, so y=-23=-m? Yes. x>= -m+1= -23+1=-22? x=22 >= -22, yes, and <=23, yes. So seg4.

Seg4: x= -m + q = -23 + q

Set to x=22, so -23 + q =22, q=45

Then p = 6m + q = 6*23 + 45 = 138 + 45 = 183

a_m=2026

n= a_m + p -1 = 2026 + 183 -1 = 2026 + 182 = 2208

Since p=183, n=2026 + 182 = 2208? 2026 + 180=2206, +2=2208.

Now, last neighbors in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

m=24 for all.

First, (24,-22): x=24, y=-22

m=24

Seg?

- Seg1: x=24, y>=1-24=-23? y=-22 >= -23, yes, and y<=24, yes. So seg1.

y= (1-m) + (p-1) = (1-24) + (p-1) = -23 + p -1 = p -24

Set to y=-22

So -22 = p - 24

p=2

a_m = a_{24} = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210

n= a_m + p -1 = 2210 + 2 -1 = 2211

Next, (24,-21): x=24, y=-21

m=24

Seg1: same, since x=24=m, y=-21 >=1-24=-23? yes, <=24, yes.

y= p -24? Same as above, y= (1-m) + (p-1) = -23 + p -1 = p -24

Set to y=-21

-21 = p - 24

p=3

n= a_m + p -1 = 2210 + 3 -1 = 2212

Last, (24,-23): x=24, y=-23

m=24

Seg? 

- Seg1: y>=1-24=-23? y=-23 >= -23, yes, and y<=24, yes. So seg1.

y= p -24

Set to -23

-23 = p -24

p=1

n= a_m + p -1 = 2210 +1 -1=2210

Which is the first number of ring 24, at (24,1-24)=(24,-23), yes.

Now, we have all neighbors' numbers:

List them:

1. (24,-22): n=2211

2. (22,-22): n=2025

3. (23,-21): n=2027

4. (23,-23): n=2209

5. (24,-21): n=2212

6. (24,-23): n=2210

7. (22,-21): n=1850

8. (22,-23): n=2208

Now, sum them up.

List: 2211, 2025, 2027, 2209, 2212, 2210, 1850, 2208

Add them step by step.

First, group them.

Notice that some are consecutive or close.

List in order: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

1850 is smallest.

Now, sum = 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Add sequentially.

Start with 1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

5902 + 2208 = 8110

8110 + 2209 = 10319

10319 + 2210 = 12529

12529 + 2211 = 14740

14740 + 2212 = 16952

So sum is 16952.

I could add in pairs.

For example, 1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952

Same.

Notice that the numbers in ring 24: 2210,2211,2212

Ring 23: 2027,2208,2209? Earlier: ring 23 neighbors: (23,-21)=2027, (23,-23)=2209, (22,-23)=2208

So 2027,2208,2209

Ring 22: (22,-22)=2025, (22,-21)=1850

And ring 24: (24,-23)=2210, (24,-22)=2211, (24,-21)=2212

So sum: ring22: 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Ring23: 2027 + 2208 + 2209

2027 + 2209 = 4236, plus 2208=4236+2208=6444? 4236+2200=6436, +8=6444

Then ring24: 2210+2211+2212=2210+2212=4422, plus 2211=4422+2211=6633? 4422+2200=6622, +11=6633

Now total sum: ring22 + ring23 + ring24 = 3875 + 6444 + 6633

First, 3875 + 6444 = 10319

10319 + 6633 = 16952

Same as before.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me confirm if all are correct.

Our point is 2026 at (23,-22), which is first of ring23.

Neighbors: we have numbers from 1850 to 2212, which seem reasonable.

Note that diagonally, for example, (22,-23) is at ring23, which is adjacent.

The sum should be symmetric or something, but anyway.

I think it's correct.

So the sum of the eight neighbors is 16952.

But let me double-check one calculation.

For example, (22,-23): we got n=2208

Position: ring m=23, seg4, x=22, y=-23

x= -m + q = -23 + q =22, q=45

p=6m + q=6*23 +45=138+45=183

a_m=2026

n=2026 + 183 -1=2026+182=2208

Now, since it's seg4, and x=22, while m=23, and seg4 starts at x= -m+1= -22, y=-23

First of seg4: q=1, x= -23+1= -22, y=-23, n= a_m + (6m +1 -1) = a_m + 6m? p for seg4 starts at p=6m+1

When q=1, p=6m+1, n=a_m + (6m+1 -1)=a_m +6m

For m=23, a_m=2026, 6*23=138, n=2026+138=2164? But earlier for (22,-23) we have 2208, inconsistency.

Mistake.

p=6m + q, q from 1 to 2m.

When q=1, p=6m+1, n=a_m + p -1 = a_m + (6m+1) -1 = a_m +6m

For m=23, a_m=2026, 6*23=138, n=2026+138=2164

But at (x,y)=(-22,-23)? Since q=1, x=-m + q= -23+1= -22, y=-23.

Now, for (22,-23), we have q=45, p=6*23 +45=138+45=183

n=2026 +183 -1=2208

Now, what is the position for p=183? Since seg4 has q from 1 to 2m=46, so q=45.

x= -m + q = -23 +45=22, y=-23, yes.

Now, the first of seg4 is at p=6m+1=6*23+1=138+1=139? Earlier I said p=6m+1 for q=1.

p=6m + q, q=1, p=6m+1

n=a_m + p -1 =2026 + (6m+1) -1=2026 +6m

For m=23, 2026+138=2164 at (-22,-23)

Now, as q increases, x increases: q=2, x=-23+2=-21, n=2026 + (6*23 +2) -1=2026 +138+2-1=2026+139=2165? p=140? p=6m+q=138+2=140? Earlier q=2, p=140? But 6m+1=139 for q=1? Inconsistency.

p=6m + q

q=1: p=6*23 +1=139? 138+1=139

n=a_m + p -1=2026 +139-1=2026+138=2164

q=2: p=6*23+2=140, n=2026+140-1=2026+139=2165

...

q=45: p=6*23+45=138+45=183, n=2026+183-1=2026+182=2208

q=46: p=6*23+46=138+46=184, n=2026+184-1=2026+183=2209, which is at x=-23+46=23, y=-23, which is the corner, last of ring.

Now, for (22,-23), x=22, which is -23 + q =22, so q=45, as above, n=2208.

Similarly, others seem correct.

Now, sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the sum again.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Add in pairs:

1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952

8298 + 8600 = 16898, plus 54 = 16952, yes.

Note that the numbers from 2208 to 2212 are consecutive except missing 2207? 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212, but we have five numbers? No, we have 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But in the list: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are all present? No:

From the neighbors: we have 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But earlier list: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are five numbers, but we have only eight neighbors, and others are smaller.

In the sum: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 — yes, eight numbers, including 2208 to 2212, which are consecutive.

2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 — that's five numbers, but we have only eight neighbors, and we have 1850,2025,2027 as well, so yes.

2208 to 2212 inclusive: 2212-2208+1=5 numbers.

Sum of 2208 to 2212: arithmetic series, average (2208+2212)/2=2210, times 5=11050.

Then the other three: 1850,2025,2027.

Sum: 1850 + 2025 = 3875, plus 2027=3875+2000=5875, +27=5902? Earlier we had 5902.

1850+2027=3877? 1850+2000=3850, +27=3877, then +2025=3877+2025=5902.

Then total sum: 11050 + 5902 = 16952.

Same.

So no mistake.

Therefore, the sum is 16952.

But the problem asks for the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026, and we got 16952.

Now, just to be thorough, let me check a smaller case to verify the method.

Suppose we take n=1, at (0,0).

Neighbors: (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=6? From earlier grid: (1,0)=2, (0,1)=4, (-1,0)=6, (0,-1)=8, and diagonals: (1,1)=3, (-1,1)=5, (-1,-1)=7, (1,-1)=9.

So neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44? Or compute: sum from 2 to 9 is (9*10/2) -1 =45-1=44? Sum 1 to 9 is 45, minus 1 is 44.

Now, according to our method: n=1, k=0, ring 0.

But our formula assumed k>=1, but for center, neighbors are all in ring 1.

We can handle separately, but for n=2026 it's not center.

Another example: take n=2, at (1,0).

Neighbors: eight neighbors: (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,1), (2,-1), (0,1), (0,-1)

Now, positions:

(2,0): should be 11? Earlier for ring2 starts at (2,-1)=10, (2,0)=11

(0,0)=1

(1,1)=3

(1,-1)=9

(2,1): ring2, x=2,y=1, seg1? m=2, seg1: x=2,y=1-m=1-2=-1? y from -1 to 2, so y=1 is in seg1. p? y=(1-m)+(p-1)= -1 + p -1 = p-2, set to 1, p-2=1,p=3. a_m=10, n=10+3-1=12

(2,-1): same ring, seg1? y=-1, p-2=-1, p=1? n=10+1-1=10

(0,1): ring1? m=max(0,1)=1, seg? x=0,y=1. seg2? seg2: y=m=1, x from m-1=0 down to -1? so x=0,-1. so (0,1) should be in seg2. q=p-2m? p for seg2: from 2m+1 to 4m? m=1, from 3 to 4? seg2: p=3,4? a_m for ring1: (2*1-1)^2 +1=1+1=2? But first is 2 at (1,0), seg1.

For (0,1): m=1, seg2: y=1, x from k-1=0 down to -1? so x=0,-1. first: p=3? since seg1: p=1,2: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3? seg2 starts at p=3: (0,1)=4? But earlier we have (0,1)=4.

a_m=2, p=3, n=2+3-1=4, yes.

Similarly, (0,-1): seg4? y=-1, x from -k+1=0 to1? seg4: p=7,8? for m=1, seg4: p=7,8? a_m=2, p=7,n=2+7-1=8? (0,-1)=8, yes.

Now for neighbors of (1,0)=2:

- (2,0): as above, (2,0)=11? m=2, seg1: x=2,y=0, y=(1-2)+(p-1)= -1 + p -1=p-2=0, so p=2? n=10+2-1=11

- (0,0)=1

- (1,1)=3? m=1, seg1: x=1,y=1, y=(1-1)+(p-1)=0+p-1=p-1=1, p=2? n=2+2-1=3

- (1,-1)=9? m=1, seg4? y=-1, seg4: x= -m + q = -1 + q, set to x=1, -1+q=1,q=2? p=6m+q=6*1+2=8? n=2+8-1=9

- (2,1): as above,12? earlier calculation: m=2, seg1, y=1, p-2=1,p=3? n=10+3-1=12

- (2,-1): m=2, seg1, y=-1, p-2=-1,p=1? n=10+1-1=10

- (0,1): m=1, seg2, x=0? seg2: y=1, x=k-q? earlier for seg2: x=k-q, y=k, q=p-2k

p for seg2: for m=1, p=3,4? when q=1,x=1-1=0? x=k-q=1-q, q=1,x=0; q=2,x=1-2=-1

So for x=0, q=1? p=2m + q? seg2: p from 2m+1 to 4m? m=1, p=3 to4? q=p-2m? q=1 when p=3, x=1-1=0, y=1, n=a_m + p -1=2+3-1=4

Similarly, (0,-1): m=1, seg4, p=7 or8? q=p-6m, x=-m+q=-1+q, set to0, -1+q=0,q=1? p=6*1+1=7? n=2+7-1=8

So neighbors: (2,0)=11, (0,0)=1, (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (2,1)=12, (2,-1)=10, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8

So numbers: 11,1,3,9,12,10,4,8

Sum: 1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12

List:1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12

Sum: 1+12=13, 3+11=14, 4+10=14, 8+9=17? Better: sum all.

1+3=4, +4=8, +8=16, +9=25, +10=35, +11=46, +12=58.

Sum from 1 to 12 is 78, minus 2,5,6,7? Numbers missing: 2,5,6,7? We have 1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12, so missing 2,5,6,7.

Sum 1 to 12 is 78, minus 2+5+6+7=20, so 78-20=58, yes.

Now, according to our method, we got sum 58 for n=2.

But in the problem, for n=2026, we got 16952.

I think our calculation is correct.

So the answer should be 16952.

But let me write it in the box.

So, the sum is 16952.

The number 2026 is located at coordinates (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (1) is at (0, 0). The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:

- (24, -22)
- (22, -22)
- (23, -21)
- (23, -23)
- (24, -21)
- (24, -23)
- (22, -21)
- (22, -23)

The numbers at these positions are determined based on the spiral layout:

- (24, -22): ring 24, segment 1, number 2211
- (22, -22): ring 22, segment 4, number 2025
- (23, -21): ring 23, segment 1, number 2027
- (23, -23): ring 23, segment 4, number 2209
- (24, -21): ring 24, segment 1, number 2212
- (24, -23): ring 24, segment 1, number 2210
- (22, -21): ring 22, segment 1, number 1850
- (22, -23): ring 23, segment 4, number 2208

The numbers are: 2211, 2025, 2027, 2209, 2212, 2210, 1850, 2208.

Summing these values:

1850 + 2025 = 3875  
3875 + 2027 = 5902  
5902 + 2208 = 8110  
8110 + 2209 = 10319  
10319 + 2210 = 12529  
12529 + 2211 = 14740  
14740 + 2212 = 16952  

The sum of the eight neighbors is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
