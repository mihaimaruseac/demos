<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It starts with 1 in the center, then 2 to the right, 3 above, 4 to the left, 5 above that, and so on. I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I need to figure out where 2026 is located in this spiral.

I recall that in such spirals, the numbers are arranged in layers or rings. The center is 1, which can be considered ring 0. Then ring 1 has numbers from 2 to 9, ring 2 from 10 to 25, and so on. Each ring has a certain size.

Let me define the rings. Let ring k start at number (2k-1)^2 + 1 and end at (2k+1)^2. For k=0: (2*0-1)^2 +1 = (-1)^2 +1 =1+1=2, but it should start at 1? That doesn't work.

Better to think that the k-th ring starts at (2k-1)^2 + 1 and ends at (2k+1)^2. For k=0: ( -1)^2 +1 =1+1=2, but center is 1, so perhaps ring 0 is just the center.

Set ring n for n >=0, where ring n has numbers from a_n to b_n.

The size of each ring: ring 0: 1 cell, ring 1: 8 cells, ring 2: 16 cells, ring 3: 24 cells? Let's see the ending numbers.

The largest number in ring k is (2k+1)^2. For example:

k=0: (1)^2 =1

k=1: 3^2=9

k=2:5^2=25

k=3:7^2=49

Yes, and it starts after the previous ring. So ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1 and ends at (2k+1)^2.

For k=1: (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1^2 +1=2, ends at 9.

k=2: (3)^2 +1=10, ends at 25.

k=3: (5)^2 +1=26, ends at 49. Perfect.

Now, the total numbers up to ring k is (2k+1)^2.

I need to find which ring 2026 is in. So solve for k such that (2k+1)^2 >= 2026.

Set m = 2k+1, so m^2 >= 2026.

Find smallest odd m such that m^2 >= 2026.

Compute sqrt(2026). sqrt(2025)=45, since 45^2=2025.

2025 < 2026, so next odd is 47? 45 is odd, 45^2=2025 < 2026, so m=47? 47^2=2209, which is larger.

But m=2k+1, so for m=45, k=(45-1)/2=44/2=22.

Ring k=22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

So 2025 is the last number of ring 22.

Thus 2026 is the first number of ring 23.

Ring k starts at (2k-1)^2 +1.

For ring k=23, starts at (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026. Yes.

So 2026 is in ring 23, and it's the first number of that ring.

Now, I need to find its position in the spiral.

Each ring has a starting point and a direction. Typically, the spiral starts at the center, goes right, then up, then left, then down, but let's confirm.

From the example: center 1. Then right to 2, then up to 3? In the given:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So looking at positions: assume center is (0,0).

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0) ? Since right of 1.

Then 3 is above 2? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Let's see:

The grid shows:

Row above: 5,4,3 — so probably y=1, x=-1,0,1? Standard is x right, y up.

Set coordinates: let’s say origin (0,0) is 1.

Then to the right: (1,0) is 2.

Then above: (1,1) is 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 3, but 1 is at (0,0), above should be (0,1).

In the given:

It shows:

... 5 4 3 ... — this is top row, say y=1

Then ... 6 1 2 ... — middle row, y=0? But 1 and 2 are both at y=0? 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0), but then above should be (0,1), which is 3? But the grid has above 1 is 3? In the text: "above" might mean north.

In the sequence: after 2, it goes to 3 above? But in spiral, usually after 2, it goes up to 3? But in this grid, from 1 to right is 2, then next is up to 3? But in the grid, 3 is above 1, not above 2.

Look: positions:

Assume:

At (0,0): 1

At (1,0): 2

At (0,1): 3? But in the grid it shows:

Top row: 5,4,3 — so if y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4? No.

Perhaps it's listed in order, but for the neighbors, I need the grid positions.

From the text:

It says: ...5 4 3... — so left to right: say x from left to right, but it's symmetric.

Notice that 1 is center, 2 is to the right (east), 3 is above (north), but in the grid, above 1 is 3? Let's see the neighbors.

For example, neighbors of 1: should be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? But in the grid, it shows around 1: to right is 2, above is 3? But below is 7? Left is 6? And diagonals.

In the grid:

Row above 1: 5,4,3 — so if 1 is at (0,0), then above it at y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But 3 is at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1).

Then same row as 1: left is 6 at (-1,0)? Right is 2 at (1,0).

Then below: 7,8,9 — so y=-1, x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9? But 8 is below 1, so (0,-1):8, (-1,-1):7, (1,-1):9.

But in the sequence, after 1 is 2 (right), then 3 (up), but 3 is at (1,1), which is northeast, not directly north.

Standard Ulam spiral usually goes right, then up, but in this case, from 1 at (0,0), to 2 at (1,0) (east), then to 3 at (1,1) (north), then to 4 at (0,1) (west), then to 5 at (-1,1) (west), then to 6 at (-1,0) (south), then to 7 at (-1,-1) (south), then to 8 at (0,-1) (east), then to 9 at (1,-1) (east). But in this grid, it shows 7 at (-1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1), which matches.

But in the given text, it has:

...5 4 3... — which would be y=1, x from left to right: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But according to above, at y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3, yes.

Then ...6 1 2... — y=0, x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2.

Then ...7 8 9... — y=-1, x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9.

But earlier I said after 5 at (-1,1), next is 6 at (-1,0), which is south, but in the sequence, from 5 to 6 is down to same x, y decreased.

But in the grid, at (-1,0) is 6, yes.

Now, the direction: from center, after 1, it moves east to 2, then north to 3, then west to 4, then west to 5? From 3 at (1,1) to 4 at (0,1), that's west, then to 5 at (-1,1), also west. Then down to 6 at (-1,0), south. Then to 7 at (-1,-1)? From (-1,0) to (-1,-1) is south? Then to 8 at (0,-1), east? Then to 9 at (1,-1), east? But 9 is at (1,-1), then next is 10 at (2,-1)? But in ring 2, it should start at 10.

Ring 1 is from 2 to 9, ring 2 from 10 to 25.

After 9 at (1,-1), it should go up to 10? But up would be to (1,0), but (1,0) is already occupied by 2. So instead, it moves north to (1,0)? But occupied, so it must move in another direction.

Standard spiral: after completing a ring, it moves to the next ring by moving right from the last position.

Last position of ring 1 is 9 at (1,-1). Then to start ring 2, it moves right to (2,-1) for 10.

Then up to (2,0), (2,1), etc.

In this case, from 9 at (1,-1), move east to (2,-1) for 10, then north to (2,0) for 11, (2,1) for 12, then west to (1,1) but occupied by 3, so continue west to (0,1) occupied by 4, no, after (2,1), it goes west to (1,1), but occupied, so it should go to (0,1)? But (0,1) is already 4, but ring 2 is new ring, so no occupation.

Positions: ring 1: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So the last cell is (1,-1).

To start ring 2, it moves east to (2,-1) for 10.

Then north to (2,0) for 11, (2,1) for 12, (2,2) for 13? Then west to (1,2) for 14, (0,2) for 15, (-1,2) for 16, (-2,2) for 17? Then south to (-2,1) for 18, (-2,0) for 19, (-2,-1) for 20, (-2,-2) for 21? Then east to (-1,-2) for 22, (0,-2) for 23, (1,-2) for 24, (2,-2) for 25? But (2,-2) is adjacent to (2,-1), but (2,-1) is 10, so should be ok.

But in this path, from (2,-1) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (2,2) — that's north three times? But ring 1 had only two steps per direction? Ring k has side length 2k+1, but the ring itself has width 1, so the perimeter is 8k for k>=1? Earlier I said ring k has size 8k? Ring 1: 8 numbers, ring 2:16? 10 to 25 is 16 numbers, yes, 8*2=16, ring 3: 26 to 49, 24 numbers, 8*3=24, yes. So size of ring k is 8k.

And it is divided into four sides: right, top, left, bottom, each of size 2k? Since 8k /4 =2k.

For ring k, each side has 2k cells? For k=1: 2*1=2 cells per side? But ring 1: right side: from (1,0) to (1,-1)? But that's only two cells? (1,0):2, (1,-1):9? But not consecutive.

Actually, the path goes: for ring k, it starts at the bottom-right corner? Let's see the starting point.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

General formula: for ring k, the starting point is at (k, -k+1) or something.

For k=1: starts at (1,0)? But 2 is at (1,0), which is east of center.

Center is (0,0), so ring k starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1, -0) = (1,0), yes.

Then it moves up: for k=1, moves up to (1,1), which is 3.

Then left to (0,1):4, (-1,1):5.

Then down to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7.

Then right to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So directions: up, left, down, right? But size: up: from y=0 to y=1, two steps? From (1,0) to (1,1), that's one step, but two cells? Positions: start at (1,0), move up to (1,1) — that's two cells: (1,0) and (1,1)? But no, it moves to adjacent cell. So from start cell, it moves in direction for a certain number of steps.

In ring k, each side has k cells? But for k=1, each side should have how many cells? Total 8 cells, 4 sides, so 2 per side? But in the path, when moving up, it moves from (1,0) to (1,1), that's one move, but two cells: the start and end? Typically, the number of moves per direction is 2k for ring k? But for k=1, 2 moves? But in up direction, it only moved once? From (1,0) to (1,1), but that's only one cell added in that direction? The cells covered: for up side: cells with x=k, y from -(k-1) to k? For k=1, x=1, y from 0 to 1? So y=0 and y=1: cells (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is the start, (1,1) is the end. But in the sequence, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3, so yes, two cells for the "up" side? But "up" is north, but from (1,0) to (1,1) is north, but it's only two cells? But for a ring, each side should have the same number.

In ring k, the side length is 2k+1 for the square, but the ring is the perimeter, so for a square of side s, perimeter is 4*(s-1), but here the square size: ring k corresponds to all cells with max(|x|,|y|) = k? For example, ring k includes all cells where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For k=0: max(0,0)=0, only (0,0)

k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so |x|<=1, |y|<=1, but max=1, so not both less than 1, so excludes (0,0), so 8 cells: all combinations where |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both |x|<1 and |y|<1, but since max=1, it includes points where |x|=1 and |y|<=1, or |y|=1 and |x|<=1, but that's the entire layer, which has (2*1+1)^2 - (2*0+1)^2 = 9-1=8 cells, yes.

The cells are those with max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For each such cell, |x| <= k, |y| <= k, and max(|x|,|y|) = k.

The spiral path: it starts at the "east" side, specifically at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1,0), which is max(|x|,|y|)=max(1,0)=1, yes.

Then it moves north (up) until it reaches (k,k). For k=1, from (1,0) to (1,1), yes.

Then moves west (left) to (-k,k). From (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), so to (-1,1).

Then moves south (down) to (-k,-k). From (-1,1) to (-1,0) to (-1,-1), so to (-1,-1).

Then moves east (right) to (k,-k). From (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1), so to (1,-1).

Then for next ring, starts at (k+1, -k)? For k=1, next ring k=2 starts at (2,-1)? Which is east of (1,-1), yes, as we had 10 at (2,-1).

Now, for each move, how many steps? In the north move, from y= -(k-1) to y=k, so delta y = k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1? But number of cells: from y=a to y=b inclusive, number is |b-a|+1.

From y= -(k-1) to y=k, difference in y is k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1, so number of cells is (2k-1) +1 = 2k? For k=1: from y=0 to y=1, cells at y=0 and y=1, so two cells, 2*1=2, yes.

Similarly, west move: from x=k to x=-k, delta x = -k - k = -2k? From x=k to x=-k, difference |k - (-k)| = 2k, number of cells is 2k +1? Positions from x=k down to x=-k, inclusive.

For k=1: x from 1 to -1, cells x=1,0,-1? Three cells? But earlier: after north, at (1,1), then west to (0,1), (-1,1), so two moves? From (1,1) to (-1,1), but that's only two cells? (1,1) and (-1,1)? But (0,1) is also included? In sequence: from (1,1):3, then to (0,1):4, then to (-1,1):5. So three cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1). But according to formula, from x=k=1 to x=-k=-1, inclusive, so x=1,0,-1? Three cells, but 2k=2, not 3. Inconsistency.

For west move, it starts at (k,k) and moves to (-k,k), so x from k to -k, step -1.

Number of cells: |k - (-k)| / |step| + 1? Distance is 2k, step size 1, so number of steps is 2k, but number of cells is number of points, which is number of steps plus one? When moving from start to end, if you move m steps, you cover m+1 cells.

In this case, from (k,k) to (-k,k), the x-coordinate changes from k to -k, delta x = -2k, so number of moves is |delta x| = 2k, and number of cells covered is 2k +1? But for k=1, 2*1 +1=3, and we have three cells: x=1,0,-1 at y=k=1.

But earlier for north move, from (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k), y from -(k-1) to k, delta y = k - (-(k-1)) = 2k-1, so number of moves is |delta y| = 2k-1, number of cells is (2k-1) +1 = 2k.

For k=1, north: 2 cells, west:3 cells? But total cells: north side:2, west side:3? But total should be 8 for k=1, 2+3+2+1? Doesn't add up.

In ring k, total cells 8k.

The sides: typically, the spiral has four sides, but the first side (north) has length 2k, but for k=1, 2 cells: (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is shared with the east side or something.

Standard way: for ring k, the path is:

- Start at (k, -(k-1))

- Move north to (k,k): this is moving y from -(k-1) to k, delta y = 2k-1, so number of moves = 2k-1, cells covered: starting cell plus 2k-1 moves, so 2k cells? For k=1: delta y=1, moves=1, cells: start (1,0), move to (1,1), so cells (1,0) and (1,1), yes 2 cells.

- Then from (k,k) move west to (-k,k): x from k to -k, delta x = -2k, moves = 2k, cells covered: start at (k,k), end at (-k,k), so cells x=k to x=-k at y=k, which is 2k+1 cells? But for k=1, from (1,1) to (-1,1), cells (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), three cells, and 2*1 +1=3, but 2k+1 for k=1 is 3, but earlier north had 2, which is 2k.

Inconsistency in cell count.

For west move, when it moves from (k,k) to (-k,k), it passes through x=k, k-1, ..., -k, so number of cells is (k - (-k)) +1 = 2k+1.

But for north move, from (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k), y from -(k-1) to k, so y= -k+1 to k, number of integers from -k+1 to k inclusive is k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1 = 2k.

So for ring k, north side has 2k cells, west side has 2k+1 cells? But that can't be, because total would not be 8k.

For k=1: north:2 cells, west:3 cells, then south: from (-k,k)=(-1,1) to (-k,-k)=(-1,-1), y from 1 to -1, delta y= -2, moves=2, cells: start (-1,1), to (-1,0), to (-1,-1), so three cells: (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1).

Then east: from (-k,-k)=(-1,-1) to (k,-k)=(1,-1), x from -1 to 1, delta x=2, moves=2, cells: (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), three cells.

Total: north 2, west 3, south 3, east 3? 2+3+3+3=11, but should be 8, and we have only 8 cells, so overlap or something. I see, the starting cell of each side is shared, but in the path, when it moves, it doesn't include the start cell again.

In the path description, when we say "move from A to B", it includes A and B, but in the sequence, each cell is visited once, so for the north move, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) and ends at (k,k), so cells from y= -(k-1) to y=k at x=k, which for k=1: y=0 to y=1 at x=1: (1,0),(1,1).

Then west move starts at (k,k)=(1,1), ends at (-k,k)=(-1,1), cells: x=1,0,-1 at y=1: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1).

But (1,1) is included in both, but in the path, it's only once, so when we list the cells for each side, we should not double-count.

Typically, the sides are defined as the cells between corners.

The corners are: (k,k), (-k,k), (-k,-k), (k,-k), and also the start point (k, -(k-1)) which is not a corner for k>1.

For ring k, there are 8k cells, and the path has 8k moves? No, it has 8k cells, so 8k-1 moves from first to last.

The path can be divided into four legs:

- Leg 1: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k,k) : this is north, and it covers cells with x=k, y from -(k-1) to k. Number of cells: from y= -k+1 to y=k, inclusive, which is k - (-k+1) +1 = 2k.

- Leg 2: from (k,k) to (-k,k) : west, cells with y=k, x from k to -k. x from k down to -k, inclusive, number: k - (-k) +1 = 2k+1.

But this includes the cell (k,k) again, which was already covered in leg 1. So to avoid double-counting, when we say "leg 2 starts at (k,k)", but (k,k) is already covered, so in the path, leg 2 starts after (k,k), so it moves to the next cell.

In the sequence, after reaching (k,k), it moves west to the next cell, so the cell (k,k) is the end of leg 1, and the start of leg 2 is the next cell west, which is (k-1,k) for k>1, but for k=1, from (1,1) it moves west to (0,1), so it doesn't include (1,1) again in the move, but the cell is already occupied.

For the cell count, for leg 2, it covers cells from (k-1,k) to (-k,k), so for k=1, from (0,1) to (-1,1), so cells (0,1), (-1,1), two cells? But earlier we have three cells in the west side? No, for k=1, at y=1, x=1,0,-1, but x=1 is already covered in north leg, so west leg covers only x=0 and x=-1 at y=1.

Similarly, for south leg, from (-k,k) to (-k,-k), but (-k,k) is end of west leg, so south leg starts at (-k,k-1) or something.

Let's list for k=1:

- Start at (1,0)

- Move north to (1,1) : cells covered: (1,0), (1,1) — 2 cells

- Then move west to (0,1), then to (-1,1) : cells covered: (0,1), (-1,1) — 2 cells? But we need to go to (-1,1), and then next is south.

After (-1,1), move south to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1) : cells covered: (-1,0), (-1,-1) — 2 cells

- Then move east to (0,-1), then to (1,-1) : cells covered: (0,-1), (1,-1) — 2 cells

Total 8 cells, each leg has 2 cells for k=1.

But earlier I thought west should have more, but for k=1, it works with 2 cells per leg.

For north leg: from (1,0) to (1,1): cells (1,0),(1,1)

West leg: from (1,1) to (-1,1)? But it moves to (0,1), then to (-1,1), so cells (0,1), (-1,1) — but (1,1) is not included in this leg; it was already covered.

So the leg starts at the cell after the corner.

In general, for ring k:

- North leg: cells with x=k, y from -(k-1) to k. But for y from -k+1 to k, number of integers: k - (-k+1) +1 = 2k, as before.

For k=1: y=0 to 1, two cells.

- West leg: cells with y=k, x from k-1 down to -k. x from k-1 to -k, inclusive.

Number of cells: (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1: x from 1-1=0 to -1, so x=0,-1, two cells.

- South leg: cells with x= -k, y from k-1 down to -k. y from k-1 down to -k.

Number: (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1: y from 0 down to -1, so y=0,-1, cells (-1,0), (-1,-1)

- East leg: cells with y= -k, x from -k+1 to k. x from -k+1 to k.

Number: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1 = 2k.

For k=1: x from -1+1=0 to 1, so x=0,1, cells (0,-1), (1,-1)

Total 8k cells, each leg has 2k cells.

Perfect.

Now, the direction: north leg: moving north, so increasing y.

West leg: moving west, decreasing x.

South leg: moving south, decreasing y.

East leg: moving east, increasing x.

And the corners: at (k,k), end of north leg, start of west leg.

At (-k,k), end of west leg, start of south leg.

At (-k,-k), end of south leg, start of east leg.

At (k,-k), end of east leg.

Now, for our purpose, we need the position of number 2026.

2026 is the first number of ring 23, since ring k=23 starts at (2*23-1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

The starting point of ring k is (k, -(k-1))

For k=23, start at (23, -(23-1)) = (23, -22)

And since it's the first cell, and it's on the north leg? The north leg starts at this point.

The north leg is moving north, so for ring k, start at (k, -k+1)  [since -(k-1) = -k+1]

Then moves north to (k,k).

Now, 2026 is at (23, -22)

We need the neighbors of this cell.

The neighbors are the eight adjacent cells: north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest.

So for cell (x,y) = (23, -22)

The neighbors are:

N: (23, -21)

NE: (24, -21)

E: (24, -22)

SE: (24, -23)

S: (23, -23)

SW: (22, -23)

W: (22, -22)

NW: (22, -21)

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions, and sum them.

Since the spiral is filled in order, we can find the ring and position for each neighbor.

Note that the neighbors might be in different rings.

Specifically, since (23,-22) is on ring 23, because max(|x|,|y|) = max(23,22)=23.

Now, the neighbors:

- (23,-21): max(|23|,|−21|)=max(23,21)=23, so same ring.

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, so ring 24? Since max=24, so ring 24.

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, ring 24.

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24.

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, same ring.

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, same ring.

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, so ring 22? Lower ring.

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, ring 22.

So, neighbors include cells in ring 22, ring 23, and ring 24.

Specifically:

- Same ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

- Ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

- Ring 24: (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

Now, we need to find the numbers at these positions.

First, since ring 22 is an inner ring, it might be already filled, and we can find the number directly.

Similarly for ring 23 and 24, but ring 24 is outer, and since 2026 is early in ring 23, ring 24 might not be started yet, but actually, ring 24 starts after ring 23 ends, so since 2026 is the first of ring 23, ring 24 hasn't started, so the cells in ring 24 are empty? But no, in the spiral, numbers are filled sequentially, so when we are at 2026, the previous numbers are filled, but ring 24 hasn't been started, so those cells are not yet assigned numbers? But that can't be, because neighbors should have numbers, but if they are outer rings, they might not be filled yet.

Problem: in the spiral, numbers are assigned in order, so when we place 2026 at (23,-22), the cells that are not yet filled are those with higher indices, but specifically, cells in ring 24 are filled after ring 23 is complete, so at this point, ring 24 is still empty. But that means the neighbors to the east and northeast, etc., are not yet filled? But that doesn't make sense because in the grid, all cells have numbers, but for neighbors of a cell, if it's on the boundary, some neighbors might not exist, but in this case, since it's a grid, all positions exist, but they might not be assigned numbers yet.

In the spiral sequence, when we place number n at a cell, the neighbors might be already filled if they are inner cells, or not filled yet if they are outer cells. But in this case, for the neighbors that are in ring 24, they will be filled later, after ring 23 is complete, so at the time when 2026 is placed, those cells are still empty, meaning they have no number assigned yet. But the problem is asking for the neighbors, which should be the numbers adjacent to it in the grid, regardless of when they are filled. So probably, we need to consider the entire grid filled, so for any cell, its neighbors have numbers, even if filled later.

But in that case, for a given cell, some neighbors are filled before it, some after. Specifically, for a cell in ring k, neighbors with smaller max(|x|,|y|) are filled earlier, neighbors with larger max(|x|,|y|) are filled later.

In this case, for (23,-22), ring 23, neighbors in ring 22 are filled before it, neighbors in ring 23 might be filled before or after, neighbors in ring 24 are filled after it.

But since we need the numbers, and the spiral is sequential, we can compute the number for each neighbor based on its position and when it is filled.

So we need to find for each neighbor position, which number is assigned to it, even if it's assigned later.

Since the spiral fills rings sequentially from center out, and within each ring in a specific order, we can compute the number for any cell given its coordinates.

So that's what we need to do: for each neighbor, find its (x,y), then find which number is there.

So we need a function that maps coordinates to number.

Since we know the ring, and the position within the ring, we can compute the number.

So let's define the function f(x,y) that gives the number at position (x,y).

First, the ring r = max(|x|,|y|).

Then, within ring r, we need the position in the spiral path.

The path starts at (r, -r+1) and goes north, then west, etc.

The total numbers before ring r: the numbers up to ring r-1 are (2(r-1)+1)^2 = (2r-1)^2.

Since ring r starts at (2r-1)^2 + 1.

Now, within ring r, we need to find the index of the cell (x,y).

The ring has 8r cells, arranged in four legs, each of length 2r.

The legs are:

1. North leg: x = r, y from -r+1 to r. But as we move north, y increases from -r+1 to r.

The cells: (r, y) for y = -r+1, -r+2, ..., r.

Number of cells: r - (-r+1) +1 = 2r.

The starting cell is (r, -r+1), which is the first cell of the ring.

In this leg, y increases from -r+1 to r.

The offset: for a given y, the index in this leg is y - (-r+1) = y + r -1.

Since it starts at y_min = -r+1, so for a cell (r,y), its position in the north leg is y - (-r+1) = y + r -1.

Since the leg has 2r cells, and it's the first leg, so the global index within the ring is this offset.

For example, r=23, cell (23,-22), which is on north leg? x=r=23, y=-22.

y_min = -r+1 = -23+1 = -22.

So y = -22, which is y_min.

So offset in leg: y - (-r+1) = -22 - (-22) =0? Or since it starts at index 0.

Position: first cell: offset 0, number is start of ring.

For (r, y_min) = (r, -r+1), offset =0.

Then next cell north: (r, -r+2), offset=1, and so on, up to (r,r), offset = r - (-r+1) = 2r-1.

For r=23, y_min=-22, so (23,-22): offset = (-22) - (-22) =0? Or y - y_min = -22 - (-22)=0.

So offset =0.

Since it's the first cell, global index in ring is 0 (if we start from 0).

So number = start of ring + offset = (2r-1)^2 + 1 + 0

For r=23, (2*23-1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2025+1=2026, which is correct.

Now, other neighbors.

But for neighbors, some are on different legs.

So we need to determine for each neighbor which leg it is on, or more generally, its position in the ring.

So for a cell in ring r, max(|x|,|y|)=r.

Then, depending on which side it is on.

The four sides:

- North side: x = r, and |y| <= r, but since max(|x|,|y|)=r and x=r, so |y| <= r, but actually y can be from -r to r, but when x=r, max is r as long as |y|<=r, but since max is r, and x=r, it must be that |y| <= r, which is always true? No, max(|x|,|y|)=max(r, |y|)=r, which implies |y| <= r, yes.

But in the ring, for x=r, y from -r to r? But for example r=1, x=1, y can be -1,0,1? But earlier for ring 1, at x=1, we have y=0 and y=1? Not y=-1? Because at (1,-1) is on east leg.

Actually, for a given r, the cells with x=r are only on the north leg? No.

In ring r, cells with x=r: but only if |y| < r? No.

For example r=1: cells: (1,0),(1,1) — both have x=r=1.

But (1,-1) also has x=1, but in ring 1, (1,-1) is present, but in our earlier, for north leg we had only y from -r+1 to r, which for r=1 is y=0 to 1, so (1,0),(1,1), but (1,-1) is on the east leg.

Similarly, for r=2: north leg: x=2, y from -2+1=-1 to 2? y=-1,0,1,2? But max(|x|,|y|)=2, so for x=2, y can be -2,-1,0,1,2? But y=-2 would be (2,-2), which should be on east leg.

So indeed, for a cell in ring r, with x=r, it is on the north leg only if y >= -r+1? Or specifically, in the north leg, y ranges from -r+1 to r, as we had.

But there are cells with x=r and y < -r+1? For example, (r, -r).

But for r>=1, |y|=r, so max(|x|,|y|)=max(r,r)=r, so it is in ring r.

But in which leg? For example r=2, cell (2,-2).

Ring 2: north leg: x=2, y from -1 to 2? y=-1,0,1,2? So (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)

But (2,-2) is not in north leg.

West leg: y=2, x from 1 down to -2? Earlier: west leg: y=r=2, x from r-1=1 down to -r=-2.

So x=1,0,-1,-2? Cells (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2)

South leg: x=-2, y from 1 down to -2? y=1,0,-1,-2? Cells (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2)

East leg: y=-2, x from -1 up to 2? x from -r+1=-1 to r=2? So x=-1,0,1,2? Cells (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2)

Ah, so (2,-2) is on the east leg.

Similarly, for (r,y) with y < -r+1, it might be on east leg.

Specifically, for a cell (x,y) in ring r, we can determine which leg it is on based on the values.

The legs correspond to the direction where the max is achieved in a certain way.

We can classify:

- If |x| = r and |x| >= |y|, then it might be east or west side, but depending on sign.

Standard way: 

- North side: when y = r and |y| >= |x| ? But max(|x|,|y|)=r, so if y=r, then max is r regardless of x, but |y| >= |x| might not hold.

Actually, the side is determined by which coordinate is at max and the sign.

From the path, but perhaps we can use the following:

For a cell (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|)=r.

Then:

- If x = r and y < r, then it is on the north leg? But for (r,y), with y < r, but y could be negative.

In north leg, we have x=r, and y >= -r+1.

But if y < -r+1, like (r,-r), which is not in north leg.

Note that the north leg has x=r and y > -r? But not.

We can check the range.

From the legs:

- North leg: x = r, y from -r+1 to r

- West leg: y = r, x from r-1 down to -r  (i.e., x <= r-1, x >= -r)

But since y=r, and |y|=r, so for west leg, y=r, and x < r? Since if x=r, it would be the corner, which is shared, but in our earlier, for west leg, it starts at (r,r) but that cell is included in north leg.

To avoid confusion, we can define the leg based on the relative position.

For a cell, we can compute its "step" in the ring.

The ring starts at (r, -r+1)

Then moves north to (r,r), covering cells with x=r, y from -r+1 to r.

Then moves west to (-r,r), covering cells with y=r, x from r-1 down to -r. Note that x=r-1,r-2,...,-r.

Then moves south to (-r,-r), covering cells with x=-r, y from r-1 down to -r.

Then moves east to (r,-r), covering cells with y=-r, x from -r+1 up to r.

Now, for each leg, we can parameterize.

But for our neighbors, we have specific positions, so we can compute for each.

List the neighbors again for (23,-22):

1. N: (23, -21)

2. NE: (24, -21)

3. E: (24, -22)

4. SE: (24, -23)

5. S: (23, -23)

6. SW: (22, -23)

7. W: (22, -22)

8. NW: (22, -21)

Now, ring for each:

- (23,-21): max(23,21)=23, ring 23

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, ring 24

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, ring 24

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, ring 23

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, ring 23

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, ring 22

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, ring 22

So we have two in ring 22, three in ring 23, three in ring 24.

Now, compute the number for each.

First, ring 22: cells (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Ring 22 starts at (2*22-1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1? 2r-1 for r=22: 2*22-1=43, so 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850.

Total cells in ring 22: 8*22=176.

Now, for (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, which leg are they in?

Ring r=22, starts at (22, -22+1) = (22, -21)

So (22,-21) is the start of the ring, so number is 1850.

Is that right? Start at (r, -r+1) = (22,-21), yes, so first cell is (22,-21), number 1850.

Then (22,-22): is this in the ring? max(|22|,|−22|)=22, yes.

Now, which leg? x=22, y=-22.

y_min for north leg is -r+1=-21.

y=-22 < -21, so not in north leg.

West leg: y=r=22, but here y=-22 ≠22.

South leg: x=-r=-22, but here x=22≠-22.

East leg: y=-r=-22, and x from -r+1 to r, i.e., -21 to 22.

So for east leg: y=-22, x from -21 to 22.

So (22,-22) is on east leg, since y=-22, x=22.

Now, east leg: starts after south leg, but we need the order.

The east leg is the last leg, moving east from (-r,-r) to (r,-r).

Starts at (-r,-r) = (-22,-22), ends at (22,-22).

Cells: (x,-22) for x from -22 to 22? But not all, only from -r+1 to r? Earlier definition: x from -r+1 to r.

For r=22, x from -21 to 22.

And direction: increasing x.

So cells: (x,-22) for x= -21, -20, ..., 22.

Number of cells: 22 - (-21) +1 = 22+21+1=44, but 2r=44, yes.

Now, the start of east leg is at (-r+1, -r) = (-21,-22)

Ends at (r,-r)=(22,-22)

Now, the south leg ends at (-r,-r)=(-22,-22), which is not included in east leg? In the path, after south leg ends at (-22,-22), it moves east to (-21,-22), so east leg starts at (-21,-22)

So cells from x= -21 to 22 at y=-22.

So (22,-22) is the last cell of the east leg, hence the last cell of the ring.

Since east leg has 2r=44 cells, from index 0 to 43.

Start: (-21,-22), index 0 in east leg.

Then x increases: x=-21: index 0, x=-20:1, ..., x=22: 22 - (-21) = 43? x from -21 to 22, delta x=43, so number of cells=44, indices 0 to 43.

For x=22, index = 22 - (-21) = 43? Since starts at x=-21, so offset = x - (-21) = x +21.

So for (22,-22), offset in east leg = 22 +21 =43.

Now, the east leg is the fourth leg, after north, west, south.

Each leg has 2r cells.

So global index within ring: index = size of first three legs + offset in fourth leg.

First three legs: north: 2r, west: 2r, south: 2r, total 6r.

Then east: offset from 0 to 2r-1.

So for offset s in east leg, global index = 6r + s.

Since index from 0 to 8r-1.

For r=22, global index = 6*22 + s = 132 + s.

s = x + 21 = 22 + 21 = 43.

So index = 132 + 43 = 175.

Since total cells 8r=176, index from 0 to 175, so last index 175.

Number = start of ring + index = 1850 + 175 = 2025.

Start of ring is 1850, index 0 is first cell, so number = 1850 + index.

Index 175, so 1850 + 175 = 2025.

But ring 22 ends at (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2=2025, yes, since ring k ends at (2k+1)^2, for k=22, (44+1)^2=45^2=2025.

And since it's the last cell, yes, number 2025.

Now, the other cell in ring 22: (22,-21)

Now, (22,-21): x=22, y=-21.

max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,21)=22, ring 22.

Now, which leg? x=22, y=-21.

North leg: x=r=22, y from -21 to 22? y_min=-21, so y=-21 is included.

In fact, (22,-21) is the start of the ring, since start is (r, -r+1)=(22,-21), so it should be the first cell.

Number is 1850.

Confirm: offset in north leg: y - y_min = -21 - (-21) =0, so index 0 in ring, number 1850.

Yes.

So for ring 22 neighbors: (22,-21):1850, (22,-22):2025.

Now, next, ring 23 neighbors: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

Ring r=23, starts at (2*23-1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Total cells: 8*23=184.

Now, compute for each.

First, (23,-21): x=23, y=-21.

This is on north leg? North leg: x=r=23, y from -23+1=-22 to 23.

y_min=-22, y=-21 > -22, so yes.

Offset in north leg: y - y_min = -21 - (-22) = -21 +22=1.

So index in north leg:1 (if start is 0).

Since north leg is first, global index in ring: offset =1.

So number = start + index =2026 +1=2027.

Is that correct? Start at (23,-22):2026, then next north to (23,-21)? But moving north, y increases, from y=-22 to y=-21? But -21 > -22, so yes, increasing y.

In ring 23, start at (23,-22), move north to (23,-21), then (23,-20), etc., up to (23,23).

So yes, (23,-21) is the second cell in the ring, so number 2027.

Now, next: (23,-23): x=23, y=-23.

Now, north leg: y_min=-22, y=-23 < -22, so not in north leg.

West leg: y=r=23, but y=-23 ≠23.

South leg: x=-r=-23, but x=23≠-23.

East leg: y=-r=-23, x from -r+1 to r, i.e., -22 to 23.

So y=-23, x=23, which is within range, so on east leg.

East leg: y=-23, x from -22 to 23.

Starts at (-22,-23), ends at (23,-23).

Offset in east leg: x - x_min, where x_min = -r+1 = -22.

So offset = x - (-22) = x +22.

For (23,-23), x=23, offset=23+22=45.

Now, east leg is the fourth leg.

Global index in ring: after first three legs.

Each leg has 2r=46 cells? r=23, 2r=46.

North:46 cells, west:46, south:46, total 138 cells.

Then east leg: offset s=45.

So global index = 138 + 45 = 183.

Total cells 184, so index 0 to 183, so 183 is last.

Number = start + index =2026 +183=2209.

But ring 23 ends at (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes, so last cell is 2209, correct.

Now, next neighbor: (22,-23)

x=22, y=-23.

Ring r=23, since max(22,23)=23.

Which leg? x=22, y=-23.

North leg: x=r=23? But x=22<23, so no.

West leg: y=r=23? But y=-23≠23.

South leg: x=-r=-23? But x=22≠-23.

East leg: y=-r=-23? Yes, y=-23.

x from -22 to 23, x=22 is within -22 to 23? -22 to 23 inclusive, yes.

So on east leg.

Offset in east leg: x - (-22) = x +22 =22+22=44.

Global index: after first three legs: 3*46=138? Each leg 2r=46 cells.

North:46, west:46, south:46, sum 138.

Then east offset:44.

So index=138+44=182.

Number=2026+182=2208.

Now, finally, ring 24 neighbors: (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

Ring r=24.

Starts at (2*24-1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Total cells:8*24=192.

Now, each neighbor: (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

All have x=24, y=-21,-22,-23.

Ring r=24, so max(|x|,|y|)=max(24,21)=24 for all, since |y|<=23<24? |y| for y=-21 is 21<24, but max is max(24,21)=24, yes.

Now, which legs? Since x=24=r, and y varies.

North leg: x=r=24, y from -r+1=-23 to 24? y_min=-23.

So y from -23 to 24.

Now, our points: y=-21,-22,-23.

y_min=-23, so y=-23 is included, y=-22,-21 also.

So all three are on the north leg.

North leg: moves north from (24,-23) to (24,24).

Starts at (r, -r+1)=(24,-23)

So first cell: (24,-23), number start=2210.

Then moves north: to (24,-22), (24,-21), etc.

So for a cell (24,y), offset in north leg: y - y_min = y - (-23) = y +23.

Then since north leg is first, global index in ring = offset.

So number = start + offset = 2210 + (y + 23)

Now, for each:

First, (24,-23): y=-23, offset= -23 +23=0, number=2210+0=2210.

Second, (24,-22): y=-22, offset= -22+23=1, number=2210+1=2211.

Third, (24,-21): y=-21, offset= -21+23=2, number=2210+2=2212.

Now, we have all neighbors' numbers.

List them:

- N: (23,-21) → ring 23, north leg, offset 1, number 2027

- NE: (24,-21) → ring 24, north leg, offset 2, number 2212

- E: (24,-22) → ring 24, north leg, offset 1, number 2211

- SE: (24,-23) → ring 24, north leg, offset 0, number 2210

- S: (23,-23) → ring 23, east leg, offset 45, index 183, number 2209

- SW: (22,-23) → ring 23, east leg, offset 44, index 182, number 2208

- W: (22,-22) → ring 22, east leg, offset 43, index 175, number 2025

- NW: (22,-21) → ring 22, north leg? start, number 1850

Now, sum them all up.

List the numbers:

1. North: 2027

2. Northeast: 2212

3. East: 2211

4. Southeast: 2210

5. South: 2209

6. Southwest: 2208

7. West: 2025

8. Northwest: 1850

Now sum: 2027 + 2212 + 2211 + 2210 + 2209 + 2208 + 2025 + 1850

To add them, we can group them.

Notice that the ring 24 neighbors: 2210,2211,2212

Ring 23 neighbors: 2027,2208,2209

Ring 22 neighbors: 1850,2025

List:

1850 (NW)

2025 (W)

2027 (N)

2208 (SW)

2209 (S)

2210 (SE)

2211 (E)

2212 (NE)

Sum = 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Add step by step.

First, sum the ring 24 ones: 2210 + 2211 + 2212.

2210 + 2212 = 4422, plus 2211 = 6633.

2210 + 2211 = 4421, plus 2212 = 6633.

Now, ring 23 neighbors: 2027 + 2208 + 2209.

2027 + 2209 = 4236, plus 2208 = 6444? 4236 + 2208.

4236 + 2000 = 6236, +208 = 6444.

2027 + 2208 = 4235, plus 2209 = 4235 + 2200 = 6435, +9 = 6444.

Now, ring 22 neighbors: 1850 + 2025 = 3875.

Now, sum these: ring 24 sum: 6633

Ring 23 sum: 6444

Ring 22 sum: 3875

Total sum: 6633 + 6444 + 3875

First, 6633 + 6444.

6600 + 6400 = 13000, 33+44=77, so 13077.

6633 + 6444: 6000+6000=12000, 633+444=1077? 633+400=1033, +44=1077, so total 12000+1077=13077.

Now plus 3875: 13077 + 3875.

13000 + 3800 = 16800, 77+75=152, so 16800+152=16952.

13077 + 3875: 13077 + 3000=16077, +875=16077+800=16877, +75=16952.

So sum is 16952.

But let me verify with another way.

Notice that the numbers are consecutive in some sense, but not exactly.

List sorted: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

We have 1850, then 2025 and 2027, which are close, then a gap to 2208-2212.

Sum: we can pair them.

For example, 1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417? But we have eight numbers, so four pairs.

The pairs I made might not be efficient.

Note that 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 are consecutive almost, but missing some.

The ring 24 ones are consecutive: 2210,2211,2212

Ring 23: 2027,2208,2209

Ring 22:1850,2025

So sum as before.

Compute numerically:

1850

+2025 = 3875

+2027 = 3875 + 2027 = 5902? 3875 + 2000 = 5875, +27=5902

Better: after adding ring 22: 1850+2025=3875

Then add ring 23: 3875 + 2027 = 5902

Then +2208 = 5902 + 2208 = 8110

5902 + 2200 = 8102, +8=8110

Then +2209 = 8110 + 2209 = 10319

8110 + 2200 = 10310, +9=10319

Now add ring 24: 10319 + 2210 = 12529

10319 + 2200 = 12519, +10=12529? 2210 is 2200+10, but 10319 + 2200 = 12519, then +10=12529.

Then +2211 = 12529 + 2211 = 14740

12529 + 2000 = 14529, +211=14529+200=14729? No: 14529 + 211 = 14529 + 200 = 14729, +11=14740? 14729 +11=14740, yes.

But we have three ring 24: 2210,2211,2212. I added 2210 and 2211, still need 2212.

After 12529 + 2210 = 12529 + 2000 = 14529? No:

10319 + 2210 = 10319 + 2000 = 12319, +210=12529? 12319 + 210 = 12319 + 200 = 12519, +10=12529, yes.

Then +2211: 12529 + 2211.

12529 + 2000 = 14529, +211 = 14529 + 200 = 14729, +11=14740.

Then +2212: 14740 + 2212.

14740 + 2000 = 16740, +212 = 16740 + 200 = 16940, +12=16952.

Same as before.

So sum is 16952.

But is this correct? Let me double-check the neighbors.

The cell is (23,-22), number 2026.

Neighbors:

N: (23,-21) → we have 2027

But 2027 is adjacent and next in sequence? In the spiral, after 2026 at (23,-22), it moves north to (23,-21) for 2027, yes, so that should be correct.

NE: (24,-21) → 2212

E: (24,-22) → 2211

SE: (24,-23) → 2210

S: (23,-23) → 2209

SW: (22,-23) → 2208

W: (22,-22) → 2025

NW: (22,-21) → 1850

Now, are these positions correct? For example, NW: (22,-21), which is west and north of (23,-22)? West is (22,-22), north is (23,-21), so northwest should be (22,-21), yes.

Now, numbers: 1850 at (22,-21), which is start of ring 22, correct.

2025 at (22,-22), end of ring 22, correct.

2027 at (23,-21), adjacent north, correct.

2208 at (22,-23), which is southwest.

(22,-23): ring 23, we computed 2208.

Similarly, south: (23,-23):2209.

Then the east ones: (24,-23):2210, (24,-22):2211, (24,-21):2212.

Now, sum 16952.

But let me confirm if (22,-23) is indeed ring 23 and we computed correctly.

x=22,y=-23, ring r=max(22,23)=23.

On east leg? y=-23, x=22.

East leg: y=-r=-23, x from -22 to 23? -r+1=-22, to r=23.

x=22 is within -22 to 23, yes.

Offset in east leg: x - (-22) = 22 +22=44.

Global index: after north, west, south legs.

Each leg: 2r=46 cells.

North:46, west:46, south:46, sum 138.

Then east offset:44.

Index=138+44=182.

Number=start of ring 23 + index=2026+182=2208, yes.

Similarly for others.

Sum seems correct.

So the sum is 16952.

But the problem asks for the sum of all eight neighbors, and we have them all.

Now, is there any duplicate or missing? We have eight neighbors, all distinct positions, and we computed each number.

To verify, perhaps for a smaller number.

For example, take number 1 at (0,0).

Neighbors: should be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

But according to our method: neighbors: (0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1)

Numbers: (0,1):3? In our earlier, but ring for each.

(0,1): max(0,1)=1, ring 1.

Start of ring 1: (2*1-1)^2 +1=1^2+1=2.

(0,1): which leg? x=0,y=1.

North leg: x=r=1,y from -1+1=0 to1? So (1,0),(1,1)

But (0,1) not in north.

West leg: y=r=1, x from r-1=0 down to -1? So x=0,-1? Cells (0,1),(-1,1)

So yes, on west leg.

Offset: x from 0 down to -1, start at (0,1)? Earlier: west leg starts at (r-1,r)=(0,1) for r=1? r=1, west leg: y=1, x from 0 to -1? So (0,1), (-1,1)

Start at (0,1), offset 0? Then to (-1,1), offset 1.

So for (0,1), offset in west leg:0.

West leg is second leg, after north.

North leg: 2r=2 cells: (1,0),(1,1)

So global index: north has 2 cells, index 0 and 1.

Then west leg: offset s, global index=2 + s.

For (0,1), s=0, index=2.

Number=start ring + index=2+2=4? But should be 3? Inconsistency.

For ring 1: cells: start (1,0):2

Then north to (1,1):3? But according to path: start at (1,0), move north to (1,1), so (1,0):2, (1,1):3

Then move west to (0,1):4? Then to (-1,1):5

Then south to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7

Then east to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9

So (0,1) is 4, not 3.

But in the grid, at (0,1) is 4, yes, as given: above center is 4? In the initial grid: ...5 4 3... so at x=0,y=1 is 4? Yes, not 3.

3 is at (1,1).

So for (0,1), number is 4.

In our calculation: ring r=1, start=2.

(0,1): on west leg, offset s=0? But global index: after north leg: north has cells (1,0): index0, (1,1):index1? So index 0 and 1.

Then west leg: starts at (0,1), which is next, so index 2? Number=2+2=4, yes.

Similarly, for (1,0): north leg, x=1,y=0, y_min=-1+1=0, offset=0-0=0, number=2+0=2.

Now, neighbors of (0,0):

N: (0,1):4

NE: (1,1):3? Since (1,1) is north leg? x=1,y=1, north leg: y from 0 to1, y=1>0, offset=y-y_min=1-0=1, index=1, number=2+1=3.

E: (1,0):2? As above.

SE: (1,-1): which leg? Ring1, y=-1, x=1.

East leg? y=-r=-1, x from -r+1=0 to1? So (0,-1),(1,-1)

East leg: fourth leg, after south.

South leg: x=-1,y from 0 down to -1? Cells (-1,0),(-1,-1)

So south: index? North:2 cells, index0,1

West:2 cells: (0,1),(-1,1)? West leg: y=1,x from0 to -1: (0,1): index2? Earlier we said index2 for (0,1), but now west leg: (0,1) and (-1,1), so index2 and3? Number: (0,1):4, (-1,1):5

Then south leg: starts at (-1,0)? After west ends at (-1,1), move south to (-1,0):6? Then to (-1,-1):7

So south leg: cells (-1,0),(-1,-1), index4 and5? Number:6 and7.

Then east leg: from (-1,-1) to (1,-1)? Move east to (0,-1):8, then to (1,-1):9

So cells (0,-1),(1,-1), index6 and7? Number8 and9.

Now, (1,-1): on east leg, offset: in east leg, x from0 to1? Start at (0,-1), offset0? Then (1,-1) offset1.

Global index: after first three legs: north2, west2, south2, total6 cells, index0 to5.

Then east: offset s, index=6+s.

For (1,-1), s=1, index=7, number=2+7=9.

Now neighbors:

(0,1):4 (N)

(1,1):3 (NE)

(1,0):2 (E)

(1,-1):9 (SE)? Southeast is (1,-1), which is 9.

But in the grid, southeast of center should be (1,-1), which is 9, yes.

S: (0,-1):8? (0,-1) is south? Directly south.

(0,-1): ring1, east leg? y=-1, x=0, on east leg, offset s=0? Since start at (0,-1), offset0, index=6+0=6, number=8? 2+6=8, yes.

SW: (-1,-1):7? x=-1,y=-1, south leg? x=-1,y=-1, south leg: x=-r=-1, y from r-1=0 down to -r=-1? So y=0,-1? Cells (-1,0),(-1,-1)

Offset: y from0 to -1, start at (-1,0), offset0? Then (-1,-1) offset1.

Global index: after north and west: index0-3? North:0,1; west:2,3; then south: index4 and5? For (-1,-1): offset1 in south leg, index=4+1? Since north and west take index0-3, south starts at index4? Offset0: index4, offset1: index5.

Number=2+5=7, yes.

W: (-1,0):6? West? Directly west: (-1,0)

On south leg? x=-1,y=0, south leg: offset0? Since start at (-1,0), offset0, index=4, number=2+4=6.

NW: (-1,1):5? Northwest: (-1,1)

On west leg? y=1,x=-1, west leg: offset? Start at (0,1), offset0; then (-1,1) offset1? Global index: after north: index0,1; west: (0,1): index2? Offset0; (-1,1): index3? Offset1. Number=2+3=5.

So neighbors: N:4, NE:3, E:2, SE:9, S:8, SW:7, W:6, NW:5.

Sum:4+3+2+9+8+7+6+5= let's see: 4+3+2=9, 9+9=18, 8+7=15, 6+5=11, total 18+15=33, +11=44, correct.

So method is good.

Now back to our sum: 16952.

But is this reasonable? The neighbors range from 1850 to 2212, average around 2000, eight neighbors, sum about 16000, and 16952 is plausible.

Since many are close, but we have computed exactly.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me write it down.

So final answer: 16952.

But in the box.

But let me confirm the addition once more.

Numbers: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Add in pairs:

1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654.

8000+8000=16000, 298+654=952, total 16952.

Same as before.

Note that 2208+2209+2210+2211+2212 = sum from 2208 to 2212.

2210 is middle, average 2210, five numbers, sum 5*2210=11050.

But we have only three of them? No, in neighbors we have 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? No, only 2208,2209,2210? From ring 23 and 24: we have 2208,2209 from ring 23, and 2210,2211,2212 from ring 24.

So not consecutive.

But anyway, we have the sum.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, as it is the first number in ring 23. The ring number \(r\) is determined by \(r = \max(|x|, |y|)\), and ring 23 starts at \((2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026\).

The eight neighbors of (23, -22) and their corresponding numbers are:

- **North (23, -21)**: In ring 23, north leg. Offset in north leg: \(y - (-22) = -21 + 22 = 1\). Global index in ring: 1. Number: \(2026 + 1 = 2027\).
- **Northeast (24, -21)**: In ring 24, north leg. Offset in north leg: \(y - (-23) = -21 + 23 = 2\). Global index in ring: 2. Number: \(2210 + 2 = 2212\) (start of ring 24 is \((2 \times 24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2210\)).
- **East (24, -22)**: In ring 24, north leg. Offset in north leg: \(y - (-23) = -22 + 23 = 1\). Global index in ring: 1. Number: \(2210 + 1 = 2211\).
- **Southeast (24, -23)**: In ring 24, north leg. Offset in north leg: \(y - (-23) = -23 + 23 = 0\). Global index in ring: 0. Number: \(2210 + 0 = 2210\).
- **South (23, -23)**: In ring 23, east leg. Offset in east leg: \(x - (-22) = 23 + 22 = 45\). Global index in ring: \(3 \times 46 + 45 = 183\) (each leg has \(2 \times 23 = 46\) cells). Number: \(2026 + 183 = 2209\).
- **Southwest (22, -23)**: In ring 23, east leg. Offset in east leg: \(x - (-22) = 22 + 22 = 44\). Global index in ring: \(3 \times 46 + 44 = 182\). Number: \(2026 + 182 = 2208\).
- **West (22, -22)**: In ring 22, east leg. Offset in east leg: \(x - (-21) = 22 + 21 = 43\). Global index in ring: \(3 \times 44 + 43 = 175\) (each leg has \(2 \times 22 = 44\) cells). Number: \(1850 + 175 = 2025\) (start of ring 22 is \((2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850\)).
- **Northwest (22, -21)**: In ring 22, north leg. Offset in north leg: \(y - (-21) = -21 + 21 = 0\). Global index in ring: 0. Number: \(1850 + 0 = 1850\).

The neighbors' numbers are: 2027, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2209, 2208, 2025, 1850.

Sum:  
\(1850 + 2025 = 3875\),  
\(3875 + 2027 = 5902\),  
\(5902 + 2208 = 8110\),  
\(8110 + 2209 = 10319\),  
\(10319 + 2210 = 12529\),  
\(12529 + 2211 = 14740\),  
\(14740 + 2212 = 16952\).

The sum of all eight neighbors is 16952.
