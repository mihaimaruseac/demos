<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand the layout of the spiral. It starts with 1 at the center, then 2 to the right, 3 above, 4 to the left, 5 above that, but looking at the grid, it's:

From the center 1, it goes right to 2, then up to 3? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Let me sketch this out.

The grid given is:

Row 1: ... 5 4 3 ... so probably positions: let's assume the center is at some coordinate. Set coordinates. Let me define the center 1 at (0,0). Then, according to the grid:

- At (0,0): 1

- To the right, (1,0): 2

- Above, (0,1): 3? But in the grid, it shows above 1 is 3, but then left of 3 is 4? The grid shows:

First row: 5,4,3 — so probably y=1: x=-1:5? Let's list the positions.

From the spiral pattern, typically it starts at center, goes right, then up, left, down, etc.

Standard Ulam spiral or something. Let me recall.

Start at (0,0) with 1.

Move right to (1,0) for 2.

Move up to (1,1) for 3? But in the given grid, above 1 is 3, which would be (0,1), but if 2 is at (1,0), then above 1 is (0,1), but adjacent to both? I need to see the sequence.

Perhaps it's: after 1 at (0,0), go right to (1,0) for 2, then up to (1,1) for 3, then left to (0,1) for 4? But in the grid, it shows left of 3 is 4, and below 4 is 5? The grid has:

... 5 4 3 ... so if we assume x increasing right, y increasing up, then at y=1: x=-1:5, x=0:4? But center is at (0,0):1, so (0,1) should be above, but here it's 4? Inconsistency.

Look at the grid:

It shows three rows:

Top row: ... 5 4 3 ... so positions, say x from left to right, y from bottom to top.

Assume the center 1 is at (0,0).

Directly above it is 3? The grid shows: above 1 is 3? In the second row it's 6,1,2 so center is 1, left is 6? No:

The grid is written as:

... 5 4 3 ...  — this is probably the top row

... 6 1 2 ...   — middle row

... 7 8 9 ...   — bottom row

So, relative to center (0,0):

- At (0,0): 1

- At (1,0): 2 (right)

- At (0,1): 3? But above 1 is 3, so (0,1) is 3

- At (-1,1): 4? Left of 3 is 4, so if 3 is at (0,1), then left is (-1,1):4

- At (-1,0): 5? But below 4 is 5? From the grid, in the top row, left to right: 5,4,3? That would be x=-1,y=1:5? But we have 4 at (-1,1)? Confusion.

List the positions given:

- Middle row: x= -1? Let's define coordinates.

Set the center 1 at (0,0).

The cell to its right is (1,0) with 2.

The cell above it is (0,1) with 3.

The cell to the left of 3 is (-1,1) with 4.

Then, the cell below 4 is (-1,0) with 5? But in the grid, the top row has 5,4,3, so if y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4? But we have (0,1) as 3, (-1,1) as 4, so x=0,y=1 is 3, x=-1,y=1 is 4, so for y=1, x=-1:4? But the grid says "5 4 3", so probably x increasing, so left to right: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But that would mean at (1,1) is 3, but earlier I thought (0,1) is 3.

I think I have a mismatch. Perhaps the "above" is not y=1.

Let's list the cells mentioned:

From the grid:

- Position relative to center: let's say center is C.

To the right of C: 2

Above C: 3

To the left of 3: 4

Below 4: 5? But in the top row, it's 5,4,3, so if 3 is above C, and 4 is left of 3, then 5 is left of 4 or below? The grid shows a row with 5,4,3, so likely on the same row, so if 3 is at some (x,y), 4 at (x-1,y), 5 at (x-2,y).

But in the bottom row, it's 7,8,9, and middle is 6,1,2.

So, for the middle row: 6,1,2 — so likely x from left to right: -1,0,1 or something.

Assume for middle row: at x=-1,y=0:6, x=0,y=0:1, x=1,y=0:2.

Then top row: x=-1,y=1:5, x=0,y=1:4, x=1,y=1:3? But then above center (0,0) is (0,1), which should be 4, but in the grid it's shown as above 1 is 3, but here (0,1) is 4, not 3. Contradiction.

Perhaps the grid is oriented differently. Maybe y increases downward, but usually in grids, y increases up.

Another possibility: the spiral is laid out with 1 at center, then it goes right, then down, then left, then up, etc.

Let me simulate the spiral placement.

Start at (0,0) with 1.

Move right to (1,0) for 2.

Then, since it's a spiral, next should be up or down? Typically, after right, it turns up.

But in the grid, above 1 is 3, so probably to (0,1) for 3.

Then left to (-1,1) for 4.

Then down to (-1,0) for 5.

Then down to (-1,-1) for 6? But in the grid, middle row has 6 at left of 1, so (-1,0) for 6.

But we have 5 at (-1,0)? Conflict.

After 4 at (-1,1), if we go down to (-1,0), but in the grid, at (-1,0) is 6, but we need to place 5 somewhere.

Perhaps after 4, it goes left or down.

Let's list the numbers in order.

The sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...

From the grid:

- 1 at center.

- 2 to the right of 1.

- 3 above 1.

- 4 to the left of 3.

- 5 is above or left? In the top row, 5 is left of 4, so if 4 is at say (0,1), then 5 at (-1,1).

But then below 5 should be something, but in the grid, below 5 is not shown, but in the middle row, left of 1 is 6, so at (-1,0):6.

Then below that is 7 at (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1):8, then (1,-1):9, and so on.

So let's map it:

- (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2

- (0,1): 3

- (-1,1): 4

- (-1,0): 5? But in the grid, at (-1,0) is 6, not 5. Problem.

In the grid, the middle row is 6,1,2, so at x=-1,y=0:6, x=0,y=0:1, x=1,y=0:2.

Top row: 5,4,3, so at y=1, x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3.

Bottom row: 7,8,9, so y=-1, x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9.

But then the sequence should be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...

From positions:

1 at (0,0)

2 at (1,0)

3 at (1,1)? But in top row, at (1,1) is 3, but above 1 is (0,1), which is 4, not 3. So above 1 is 4, not 3.

The grid shows "above 1 is 3", but according to this, at (0,1) is 4, at (1,1) is 3, so above and right of 1 is 3, but directly above is 4.

This is confusing. Perhaps the "above" in the grid is not directly above, but the cell labeled "above" is 3, which is at (1,1), so northeast of 1.

But typically for neighbors, we need adjacent cells, so for cell (0,0), neighbors are (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1), etc.

In this case, at (1,0):2, at (0,1):4, at (-1,0):6, at (0,-1):8, at (1,1):3, at (1,-1):9, at (-1,1):5, at (-1,-1):7.

So the eight neighbors are: 2,4,6,8,3,9,5,7.

Sum is 2+4+6+8+3+9+5+7 = let's calculate: 2+4=6, +6=12, +8=20, +3=23, +9=32, +5=37, +7=44.

But this is for 1, not for 2026.

The grid is given for the start, but for larger n, it's the same spiral pattern.

So I need to understand how the spiral is filled.

Let me try to see the order of filling.

From the grid, we have:

- (0,0):1

- (1,0):2

- (1,1):3

- (0,1):4

- (-1,1):5

- (-1,0):6

- (-1,-1):7

- (0,-1):8

- (1,-1):9

- then probably (2,-1):10, (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13, (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17, etc.

Let me verify with the numbers.

After 9 at (1,-1), next should be to the right, but (2,-1) is east of (1,-1), but in spiral, after down or what.

Typically, after placing 9 at (1,-1), the direction was down or left? From 8 at (0,-1), to 9 at (1,-1), so it moved right.

Then, to continue the spiral, it should turn up, so to (2,-1)? But (2,-1) is south-east, but from (1,-1), up would be (1,0), but (1,0) is already occupied by 2.

Standard spiral: after completing a layer, it moves to the next layer.

General rule: the spiral is built by moving in directions: east, north, west, south, and so on, increasing the step size.

For layer k, it starts at (k, k-1) or something. Let's think.

The position of number n can be found by finding which "ring" it is in.

The central cell is ring 0, containing only 1.

Ring 1 is the cells around it, from 2 to 9, but 2 to 9 is 8 cells, which is for ring 1.

Ring k has 8k cells, for k≥1, and the first number in ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1 or something.

Let me calculate the size.

Ring 0: 1 cell, number 1.

Ring 1: cells from 2 to 9, 8 cells.

Ring 2: from 10 to 25? 25-10+1=16 cells, which is 8*2, yes.

Ring k has 8k cells.

The last number in ring k is the sum of cells up to ring k, which is 1 + sum_{m=1}^k 8m = 1 + 8*(k(k+1)/2) = 1 + 4k(k+1)

Sum from m=1 to k of 8m = 8 * k(k+1)/2 = 4k(k+1)

So total numbers up to ring k is 1 + 4k(k+1)

This is the last number of ring k, which is the number at the end of the ring.

The last cell of ring k is at position (k, -k) or something.

Typically, the last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

For k=0, last number is 1 = 1^2.

k=1, last number is 9=3^2.

k=2, last number is 25=5^2.

k=3, last number is 49=7^2.

Yes, so last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

The first number of ring k is the next after ring k-1 ends, so after (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2.

So first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For example, k=1: (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1+1=2.

k=2: (3)^2 +1=9+1=10.

k=3: (5)^2 +1=25+1=26.

Now, ring k has 8k cells.

The position: for a given n, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Since last of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

n is in ring k if (2k-1)^2 < n ≤ (2k+1)^2.

For n=1, k=0, but let's define k starting from 0.

For n=1, it's ring 0.

For n=2 to 9, ring 1.

n=10 to 25, ring 2.

So ring k for k≥1 corresponds to n from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

But for k=1: (1)^2 +1=2 to 3^2=9.

k=2: 3^2 +1=10 to 5^2=25.

k=3:5^2+1=26 to7^2=49, etc.

Now, for ring k, the side length is 2k+1, but the ring itself is the perimeter.

Now, the starting point of ring k: typically, ring k starts at (k, k-1) or something.

For k=1: starts at n=2, which is at (1,0) in our earlier coordinate.

k=2: starts at n=10, which should be at (2,-1)? Let me compute.

From earlier, after 9 at (1,-1), next is 10 at (2,-1)? Then 11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2), 14 at (1,2), 15 at (0,2), 16 at (-1,2), 17 at (-2,2), 18 at (-2,1), 19 at (-2,0), 20 at (-2,-1), 21 at (-2,-2), 22 at (-1,-2), 23 at (0,-2), 24 at (1,-2), 25 at (2,-2).

Last is 25 at (2,-2), which is correct since (2k+1)^2=25 for k=2.

Now, the neighbors of a cell depend on its position, but since the spiral is symmetric, but for a given n, I need to find its coordinates, then find the eight adjacent cells, then find what numbers are there.

But since the spiral is filled in order, the neighbors might not be consecutive, so I need to find the coordinates of n, then the coordinates of its neighbors, then for each neighbor coordinate, find which n is there.

This might be computationally intensive, but since n=2026 is large, I need a formula.

First, find which ring 2026 is in.

Find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Compute (2k+1)^2 ≈ 2026.

Square root of 2026 ≈ ? 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025=45^2, so (2k+1)^2 = 2025? But 2025 is a square, so it might be the last of some ring.

(2k+1)^2 = 2025, so 2k+1=45, k=22.

So ring k=22, since last number is (2*22 +1)^2 =45^2=2025.

So n=2025 is in ring k=22? Ring k ends at (2k+1)^2, so for k=22, ends at 45^2=2025.

First number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

For k=22, first number is (2*22 -1)^2 +1 =43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

So ring 22: n from 1850 to 2025.

2026 is greater than 2025, so it should be in ring k=23.

k=23: first number is (2*23 -1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Last number is (2*23 +1)^2=47^2=2209.

So n=2026 is the first number of ring 23.

Now, where is the first number of ring k located?

In the spiral, for each ring, it starts at the bottom right? For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

Check for small k.

For k=1: starts at n=2, position (1,0)

For k=2: starts at n=10, position (2,-1)? Earlier I said (2,-1) for 10.

For k=3: starts at n=26, position? According to pattern, (3,-2)? Let me compute.

After ring 2 ends at (2,-2) with 25.

Then next ring k=3 starts at (3,-2)? Then move left? Standard: after completing ring k-1, which ends at (k-1, -(k-1))? For k=2, ended at (2,-2).

Then for next ring, move right to (k, -(k-1))? For k=3, move to (3,-2)? But -(k-1) = -2 for k=3.

Then from there, move up.

In general, for ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1, -0) = (1,0), correct.

k=2: (2,-1), correct for n=10.

k=3: (3,-2), should be n=26.

Now, the direction: from the start, it moves up for the first segment.

For ring k, the segments are: move up for k steps? The side length for ring k is 2k+1, but since it's a ring, each "side" has k cells? No.

Ring k is the cells at Manhattan distance k from center? In grid, the ring at distance r has cells with max(|x|,|y|) = r.

In this spiral, the ring k corresponds to max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, ring k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, cells: (1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)? But max(|x|,|y|)=1 for these, but there are 8 cells, yes.

In our earlier assignment, for ring 1: positions with max(|x|,|y|)=1: (1,0):2, (0,1):3? Earlier we had (0,1):4? Inconsistency.

In our coordinate, for ring 1: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

Now max(|x|,|y|): for (1,0): max(1,0)=1, (1,1):1, (0,1):1, (-1,1):1, (-1,0):1, (-1,-1):1, (0,-1):1, (1,-1):1. All have max(|x|,|y|)=1, good.

But in order, it's not sorted, but all are in ring 1.

Now for ring k, the cells are all (x,y) with max(|x|,|y|) = k.

Number of such cells: for each side, but excluding corners? Total cells with max(|x|,|y|) ≤ k is (2k+1)^2, since it's a square from -k to k.

For example, k=1: from -1 to 1, 3x3=9 cells, but ring 0 is center, ring 1 is the perimeter, which has 8 cells, while total cells up to max dist k is (2k+1)^2.

Up to ring k inclusive, total numbers are sum_{m=0}^k size of ring m.

Ring m has size: ring 0:1, ring 1:8, ring 2:16? Earlier we said ring k for k≥1 has 8k cells.

Ring 0:1 cell.

Ring 1:8 cells.

Ring 2:16 cells? But total up to ring 2: 1+8+16=25, which is 5^2, yes.

But 8k for k≥1: k=1:8, k=2:16, k=3:24? But 24 cells? Total up to ring 3: (7)^2=49, up to ring 2 is 25, so ring 3 has 49-25=24 cells, yes, 8*3=24.

Now, for a cell in ring k, max(|x|,|y|)=k.

Now, for n=2026, it is the first number of ring k=23.

First number of ring k is at position (k, -(k-1))? Earlier for k=1: (1,0) = (1,-(1-1))? -(0)=0, yes (1,0)

k=2: (2,-1) = (2,-(2-1))? -(1)=-1, yes.

k=3: (3,-2) = (3,-(3-1))? -(2)=-2, yes.

So for ring k, starts at (k, -(k-1))

For k=23, starts at (23, -(23-1)) = (23, -22)

Now, the direction: it moves up first.

In the spiral, for each ring, it starts at the bottom right? (k, -(k-1)) for k≥1.

For k=1: (1,0), which is right, not bottom.

From (k, -(k-1)), it moves up for how many steps?

The ring has 8k cells, divided into four sides: east, north, west, south, but each side has 2k cells? Let's see.

For ring k, each "side" has k cells? No.

For example, ring k=1: 8 cells.

From start (1,0), move up to (1,1), then left to (0,1), (-1,1), then down to (-1,0), (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1), (1,-1).

So movements: up 1 step (to (1,1)), then left 2 steps? To (0,1), then (-1,1), so two steps left? But k=1.

Actually, for ring k, the segments are:

- Move up: k steps? From (k, -(k-1)) to (k, -(k-1) + k) = (k,1)? For k=1: from (1,0) up to (1,1), which is one step, so k steps? k=1, one step.

Then move left: from (k,1) to (k - something,1). For k=1: from (1,1) left to (0,1), then to (-1,1)? So two steps? But k=1, should be k steps? Not matching.

General rule: for ring k, it moves:

- Up: k times? But for k=1, it moved up once.

Then left: but it moved left twice? To (0,1) and (-1,1).

After (1,1), it moves left to (0,1), then to (-1,1), so two cells: (0,1) and (-1,1).

But k=1.

Then down: from (-1,1) to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1), two steps.

Then right: from (-1,-1) to (0,-1), then to (1,-1), two steps.

Total: up:1, left:2, down:2, right:2, but 1+2+2+2=7, but there are 8 cells. Missing the start? The movements are between cells.

Typically, the ring starts at (k, -(k-1)), then:

- Move up: k steps? But each step moves to a new cell.

For k=1: start at (1,0), then move up to (1,1) — that's one cell added.

Then move left to (0,1) — second cell.

Then move down? From (0,1) down to (0,0)? But (0,0) is center, occupied.

After (-1,1), it moves down to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1).

So sequence: start at cell A: (1,0)

Move up to B: (1,1)

Move left to C: (0,1)

Move left to D: (-1,1)

Move down to E: (-1,0)

Move down to F: (-1,-1)

Move right to G: (0,-1)

Move right to H: (1,-1)

So cells: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.

Movements: from A to B: up

B to C: left

C to D: left? From (0,1) to (-1,1), yes left.

Then D to E: down

E to F: down

F to G: right? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1), yes right.

G to H: right to (1,-1)

So directions: up, left, left, down, down, right, right.

But for k=1, it should be symmetric.

Notice that the number of moves in each direction: up:1, left:2, down:2, right:2? But total moves 7, but 8 cells.

The directions are: first up for 1 step (since k=1), but then left for 2k? k=1,2 steps? But 2>1.

Standard description: for ring k, starting at (k, k-1) but in our case (k, -(k-1))

And moves: up for k steps? But for k=1, up for 1 step: from (1,0) to (1,1)

Then left for k steps? But k=1, left for 1 step: to (0,1)

But in our case, it went to (-1,1), so two steps.

Perhaps it moves left for 2k steps? But k=1,2 steps.

But 2k for k≥1.

For k=1: left for 2*1=2 steps: from (1,1) to (0,1) then to (-1,1), yes.

Then down for 2k steps? From (-1,1) down to (-1,0) then to (-1,-1), yes 2 steps.

Then right for 2k steps? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1) then to (1,-1), but (1,-1) is the last, but for k=1, it ends at (1,-1), but the start was (1,0), so not closed.

After down to (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1), then to (1,-1), and that's it. But the ring is complete, but the next ring starts at (2,-1) or something.

For ring k, after moving right, it should end at (k, -k) or something.

For k=1: ended at (1,-1)

For k=2: started at (2,-1), ended at (2,-2)

For k=3: start at (3,-2), end at (3,-3)

In general, ends at (k, -k)

Now, the movements: from start (k, -(k-1))

Move up: for how many steps? To reach y=k? Start at y= -(k-1), move up to y=k.

Change in y: k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k -1? But that would be many steps.

Each step moves one cell, so number of steps is the difference.

From y= -(k-1) to y=k, delta y = k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1.

But for k=1: from y=0 to y=1, delta y=1, which is 2*1-1=1, so one step: to (k,k) = (1,1)

Then move left: to x= -k? Currently at x=k, y=k, move left to x= -k.

Delta x = -k - k = -2k, so |delta x|=2k, so 2k steps left.

For k=1: from (1,1) left to x=-1, so to (0,1), (-1,1), two steps, yes 2*1=2.

Then move down: from (-k,k) to (-k,-k)? Currently at (-k,k), move down to y=-k.

Delta y = -k - k = -2k, so 2k steps down? For k=1: from (-1,1) down to (-1,-1), delta y= -2, so two steps: to (-1,0), then (-1,-1), yes.

Then move right: from (-k,-k) to (k,-k)? Currently at (-k,-k), move right to x=k.

Delta x = k - (-k) = 2k, so 2k steps right.

For k=1: from (-1,-1) right to (1,-1), so to (0,-1), then (1,-1), two steps, yes.

And ends at (k,-k), as said.

Total cells: in up: 2k-1 steps? Steps mean number of moves, but each move adds one cell.

The path: from start (k, -(k-1)), then move up: we move to (k, y+1) for each step, total moves: from y= -(k-1) to y=k, so y increases by 1 each step, number of steps: k - (-(k-1)) = 2k-1.

But each step adds a new cell, so number of cells added in this segment: 2k-1? But for k=1, 2*1-1=1 cell: from (1,0) to (1,1), but (1,0) is already the start, so when we move, we add the new cell.

In the sequence, the start cell is already placed, then we move to new cells.

For ring k, we start at cell (k, -(k-1)), which is assigned the first number.

Then we move up: each move to a new cell, total moves: to reach y=k, so we add cells at y= -(k-1)+1, -(k-1)+2, ..., k.

So y from -(k-1)+1 = -k+2 to k? For k=1: y from -0+1? -(1-1)+1=0+1=1? So only y=1, but we move from (1,0) to (1,1), so we add (1,1).

The y-coordinates added: from start y= -(k-1), we move up, so we add cells with y= -(k-1) +1, -(k-1)+2, ..., up to k.

So the y-values: start from s_y = -(k-1) +1 = -k+2? Then to k.

Number of cells: from y= -k+2 to k inclusive? Values: -k+2, -k+3, ..., k.

Number: k - (-k+2) + 1 = k + k -2 +1 = 2k -1.

For k=1: 2*1-1=1 cell: y=1? But we add (1,1), and start was (1,0), so yes, one new cell.

Then after that, we are at (k,k) = (1,1) for k=1.

Then move left: from x=k to x= -k, so we add cells with x=k-1, k-2, ..., -k+1, -k? From x=k, move left to x=k-1, k-2, ..., down to x=-k.

So x from k-1 down to -k.

Values: k-1, k-2, ..., -k.

Number: from k-1 to -k, decreasing, number is (k-1) - (-k) + 1 = k-1 +k +1 = 2k.

For k=1: x from 1-1=0 down to -1, so x=0,-1, two cells, yes.

After moving left, we are at (-k,k) = (-1,1) for k=1.

Then move down: from y=k to y=-k, so add cells with y=k-1, k-2, ..., -k+1, -k? From y=k, move down to y=k-1, ..., down to y=-k.

So y from k-1 down to -k.

Number: (k-1) - (-k) +1 = k-1 +k +1=2k.

For k=1: y from 0 down to -1? y=0,-1? But current y=k=1, move down to y=0, then to y=-1, so cells (-1,0), (-1,-1), yes two cells.

After that, at (-k,-k)=(-1,-1)

Then move right: from x=-k to x=k, so add cells with x=-k+1, -k+2, ..., k-1, k? From x=-k, move right to x=-k+1, ..., up to x=k.

So x from -k+1 to k.

Number: k - (-k+1) +1 = k +k -1 +1=2k.

For k=1: x from -1+1=0 to 1, so x=0,1? Cells (0,-1), (1,-1), yes.

Ends at (k,-k)=(1,-1)

Total cells in ring: the start cell plus the cells added in moves.

Start cell: one.

Then up segment: adds 2k-1 cells? For k=1:1 cell.

Left segment: adds 2k cells? k=1:2 cells.

Down segment: adds 2k cells.

Right segment: adds 2k cells.

Total: 1 + (2k-1) + 2k + 2k + 2k = 1 + 2k -1 + 6k = 8k? 1 -1 +2k+6k=8k, yes for k≥1.

But for k=1: 1 (start) +1 (up) +2 (left) +2 (down) +2 (right) =8, but the start is included, and the moves add more, but total should be 8k.

In this count: start cell:1

Added in up: 2k-1

Added in left: 2k

Added in down: 2k

Added in right: 2k

Sum: 1 + (2k-1) + 2k + 2k + 2k = 1 -1 + 2k + 2k + 2k + 2k? 1 + 2k -1 + 2k + 2k + 2k = (1-1) + (2k+2k+2k+2k) = 0 + 8k =8k, yes.

For k=1: 1 +1 +2+2+2=8, but the cells: start (1,0), up adds (1,1), left adds (0,1),(-1,1), down adds (-1,0),(-1,-1), right adds (0,-1),(1,-1). Total 8 cells, good.

Now, for n=2026, it is the first cell of ring k=23, at position (23, -(23-1)) = (23, -22)

Now, I need to find the eight neighbors of this cell: that is, the eight adjacent cells: (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1), but not diagonally? No, neighbors usually include diagonally adjacent, so Moore neighborhood, all eight surrounding cells.

In the problem, it says "all 8 neighbors", and for example, for 1, neighbors were 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, which include diagonals, since (1,1) is diagonal to (0,0).

So yes, all eight adjacent cells.

So for cell at (x,y), neighbors are (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1), but specifically: (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), (x-1,y-1).

Now, for n=2026 at (23,-22), so neighbors at:

(24,-22), (22,-22), (23,-21), (23,-23), (24,-21), (24,-23), (22,-21), (22,-23)

Now, I need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since the spiral is filled in order, and these positions are fixed, I need to find for each neighbor coordinate, which ring it is in, and its position in the spiral.

Each neighbor is at some (a,b), and since max(|a|,|b|) determines the ring.

For a cell (x,y), it is in ring r where r = max(|x|,|y|).

Because the ring is defined by max(|x|,|y|) = r.

For example, (23,-22): |x|=23, |y|=22, max=23, so ring r=23.

Similarly, neighbors:

1. (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24, ring 24

2. (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, ring 22

3. (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23, ring 23

4. (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23

5. (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24, ring 24

6. (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24, ring 24

7. (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, ring 22

8. (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23? |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23

List:

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, ring 24

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, ring 22

- (23,-21): max(23,21)=23, ring 23

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, ring 23

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, ring 24

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, ring 22

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23, ring 23

So neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22), (22,-21)

Ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

Ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

And (22,-22) is ring 22, (22,-21) ring 22, (23,-21) ring 23, etc.

Now, n=2026 is at (23,-22), which is ring 23, and it's the first cell, so number 2026.

To find the numbers at neighbors, I need to find the number corresponding to each coordinate.

For a cell in ring r, at position (x,y), with max(|x|,|y|)=r.

The number depends on where it is in the ring.

The ring has 8r cells.

The ring starts at (r, -(r-1)) with number n_start(r) = (2r-1)^2 + 1

For r=23, n_start= (2*23 -1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2025+1=2026, correct.

The ring proceeds as described: from start (r, -(r-1)) = (23,-22) for r=23.

Then moves up: adds 2r-1 cells? Earlier we had the segments.

From earlier description:

Start at (r, s_y) with s_y = -(r-1)

Then move up: to y increasing, from s_y to r.

s_y = -(r-1), so y from -(r-1) to r, but we start at y=s_y, then move up to y=r.

The cells added: when moving up, we add cells with same x=r, y from s_y +1 to r.

Since we start at (r, s_y), and move to (r, s_y +1), (r, s_y +2), ..., up to (r,r).

So y-coordinates: s_y, s_y+1, ..., r.

But s_y = -(r-1), so y: -(r-1), -(r-1)+1, ..., r.

Which is y= -(r-1), -r+2, ..., r.

The values: from a to b inclusive, number is b-a+1.

a = -(r-1) = -r+1, b=r, so number of cells: r - (-r+1) +1 = r + r -1 +1 = 2r.

But earlier for k=1, we had only one cell? Contradiction.

For k=1, r=1, s_y = -(1-1)=0, y from -0? -0 to 1? y=0,1? But we have cells (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is the start, and when we move up, we add (1,1), so only one new cell, but according to this, from y=0 to y=1, inclusive? But if inclusive, it includes both, but the start is already placed.

I think I need to be careful: the start cell is already assigned, so in the up segment, we move from the start cell to new cells.

So, at the beginning, we are at cell (r, s_y), which is already occupied.

Then we move up to (r, s_y +1), which is new.

Then to (r, s_y +2), ..., up to (r, r).

Now, s_y = -(r-1), so y-coordinate of new cells: s_y +1, s_y +2, ..., r.

So y: -(r-1) +1 = -r+2, -(r-1)+2=-r+3, ..., up to r.

The sequence: y = -r+2, -r+3, ..., r.

Number of terms: from -r+2 to r, inclusive.

Number: r - (-r+2) + 1 = r + r -2 +1 = 2r -1.

For r=1: y= -1+2=1? Only y=1, one cell, correct.

For r=23: y from -23+2=-21 to 23? -21 to 23 inclusive? Number: 23 - (-21) +1 = 23+21+1=45.

But total cells in up segment: 2r-1=45 for r=23.

But this includes only the new cells added during up move, not including the start.

In this segment, we add 2r-1 cells, but the start is separate.

After moving up, we are at (r,r).

Then we move left: from (r,r) to (r-1,r), (r-2,r), ..., down to (-r,r).

So x from r-1 down to -r.

y=r constant.

Add cells: x=r-1, r-2, ..., -r.

Number: (r-1) - (-r) +1 = r-1 +r +1=2r.

For r=23: 46 cells? But each segment adds cells.

After left, at (-r,r).

Then move down: from (-r,r) to (-r,r-1), (-r,r-2), ..., to (-r,-r).

y from r-1 down to -r.

Add cells: y=r-1, r-2, ..., -r.

Number: (r-1) - (-r) +1 = r-1 +r +1=2r.

After down, at (-r,-r).

Then move right: from (-r,-r) to (-r+1,-r), (-r+2,-r), ..., to (r,-r).

x from -r+1 to r.

Add cells: x=-r+1, -r+2, ..., r.

Number: r - (-r+1) +1 = r +r -1 +1=2r.

After that, at (r,-r).

Now, total cells in ring: start cell + cells added in up + left + down + right = 1 + (2r-1) + 2r + 2r + 2r = 1 + 2r -1 + 6r = 8r, good.

For n=2026 at (23,-22), which is the start of ring 23, so it is the first cell.

Now, for the neighbors, I need to compute for each neighbor coordinate the number.

Since the neighbors are in different rings, and some might be in inner or outer rings.

Specifically, we have neighbors in ring 22, 23, 24.

List them again:

- Ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

- Ring 23: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

- Ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

(22,-23) is ring max(22,23)=23, yes.

Now, for each, I need to find the number based on its position in its ring.

First, let's handle ring 22.

Ring r=22.

Start at (22, -(22-1)) = (22, -21)

First number: n_start(22) = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

Now, the ring proceeds:

Start at (22,-21)

Move up: add cells with x=22, y from -21+1 = -20 to 22? y-coordinates: s_y +1 to r, i.e., -20 to 22.

Number: 2r-1=44-1=43? For r=22, 2*22-1=43 cells added in up move? But total ring size 8*22=176, and 43 is less.

The cells added: y= -20, -19, ..., 22.

Number: 22 - (-20) +1 = 22+20+1=43, yes.

But this is only the up segment, after start.

The start cell is (22,-21), which is included separately.

Now, for a cell in the ring, its number depends on the path.

Specifically, for a cell (x,y) in ring r, we can find which segment it is in and the offset.

Now, for our neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, (22,-21): this is exactly the start cell of ring 22.

Because start is at (22, -(22-1)) = (22,-21)

So it is the first cell, so number is n_start(22) = 1850.

Now, the other neighbor: (22,-22)

Now, where is this in the ring?

Position (22,-22)

In ring r=22, max(|x|,|y|)=22, since |x|=22, |y|=22.

The ring starts at (22,-21)

Then moves up: to (22,-20), (22,-19), ..., up to (22,22)

So y increasing from -20 to 22.

But (22,-22) has y=-22, which is less than -21, so not in the up segment.

After up segment, we are at (22,22)

Then move left: to (21,22), (20,22), ..., down to (-22,22)

So y=22 constant, x decreasing.

Then down: to (-22,21), (-22,20), ..., to (-22,-22)

Then right: to (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., to (22,-22)

Ah, so (22,-22) is in the right segment? Or down?

Specifically, in the move right segment.

After moving down, we are at (-22,-22)

Then move right: to (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., to (22,-22)

So x increasing from -21 to 22, y=-22 constant.

Now, the cells added: x= -21, -20, ..., 22.

Number: 22 - (-21) +1 = 22+21+1=44, which is 2r=44 for r=22.

Now, the sequence: start from (-22,-22), then move to (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., (22,-22)

So the last cell is (22,-22)

Now, since it's the end of the ring, and we know the last number of ring r is (2r+1)^2.

For r=22, last number is (2*22 +1)^2 =45^2=2025.

Since it's the last cell, number is 2025.

The ring starts at 1850, ends at 2025, total cells 2025-1850+1=176, and 8*22=176, yes.

The move right segment adds 2r=44 cells, but including the start? No.

In the move right segment, we start at (-22,-22), which is already added? In the sequence, after moving down, we are at (-22,-22), which was added in the down segment.

Recall: after down segment, we are at (-r,-r), which is the last cell of down segment.

Then we move right: to new cells: first (-r+1,-r), (-r+2,-r), ..., up to (r,-r)

So for r=22, from (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., (22,-22)

So cells: x= -21 to 22, y=-22.

Number: 22 - (-21) +1=44, as said.

The first cell of this segment is (-21,-22), last is (22,-22)

The entire ring has numbers from 1850 to 2025.

The segments:

- Start cell: (22,-21): 1850

- Up segment: adds 43 cells: (22,-20) to (22,22): numbers 1851 to 1850+43=1893? Let's compute.

After start, we add cells in up move: first cell added is (22,-20), which should be number 1851.

Then (22,-19):1852, ..., up to (22,22): what number?

The y-coordinates: from y=-20 to y=22, inclusive.

Number of cells: 22 - (-20) +1 = 22+20+1=43, yes.

So numbers from 1851 to 1850 + 43 = 1893? 1850 + 43 = 1893, but since it starts at 1851, ends at 1850 + 43 = 1893? 1850 (start) + 43 cells added = total so far 44 cells, last number 1850 + 43 = 1893? The start is cell 1, up adds 43 cells, so total cells up to end of up: 1 + 43 =44 cells, numbers 1850 to 1850 + 43 = 1893? The numbers are consecutive, so from 1850 to 1850 + 43 = 1893, but that's 44 numbers: 1850,1851,...,1893.

But the last cell is (22,22), number 1893.

Then move left: from (22,22) to (21,22), (20,22), ..., to (-22,22)

Add cells: x=21 down to -22? From current position (22,22), move left to (21,22), (20,22), ..., (-22,22)

So x from 21 to -22, decreasing.

Number: 21 - (-22) +1 = 21+22+1=44, which is 2r=44.

Numbers: next after 1893, so 1894 to 1893 + 44 = 1937? 1893 + 44 = 1937.

First cell: (21,22):1894, last: (-22,22):1937.

Then move down: from (-22,22) to (-22,21), (-22,20), ..., to (-22,-22)

Add cells: y=21 down to -22? From y=22 to y=-22, but current is (-22,22), move down to (-22,21), etc., down to (-22,-22)

So y from 21 to -22, decreasing.

Number: 21 - (-22) +1 = 21+22+1=44.

Numbers: next after 1937, so 1938 to 1937 + 44 = 1981? 1937 + 44 = 1981.

First: (-22,21):1938, last: (-22,-22):1981.

Then move right: from (-22,-22) to (-21,-22), (-20,-22), ..., to (22,-22)

Add cells: x= -21 to 22, y=-22.

Number: 22 - (-21) +1=44.

Numbers: next after 1981, so 1982 to 1981 + 44 = 2025? 1981 + 44 = 2025, yes.

First: (-21,-22):1982, last: (22,-22):2025.

Perfect.

So for neighbor (22,-22): it is the last cell of ring 22, so number 2025.

Now, the other neighbor in ring 22 is (22,-21), which is the start cell, number 1850.

Now, next, neighbors in ring 23.

Ring r=23.

Start at (23,-22), number 2026.

Neighbors: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

First, (23,-21): where is this?

Start at (23,-22)

Move up: add cells with x=23, y from -22+1 = -21 to 23.

So y= -21, -20, ..., 23.

Now, (23,-21) is exactly the first cell added in the up move, since start is (23,-22), then move up to (23,-21).

So it should be the second cell in the ring.

Numbers: start:2026, then next:2027.

Since it's the first new cell after start.

In sequence: cell 1: (23,-22):2026

Cell 2: (23,-21):2027

Yes.

Now, next neighbor: (23,-23)

Now, this is at y=-23.

After up move, we are at (23,23)

Then move left to (-23,23)

Then move down to (-23,-23)

Then move right to (23,-23)

Specifically, in the move right segment.

After down, at (-23,-23)

Then move right: to (-22,-23), (-21,-23), ..., to (23,-23)

So (23,-23) is the last cell of the ring.

Last number of ring 23 is (2*23 +1)^2 =47^2=2209.

So number 2209.

Now, the other neighbor: (22,-23)

This is in ring 23, position (22,-23)

Where is this in the ring?

After moving down to (-23,-23), then move right: to (-22,-23), (-21,-23), ..., to (23,-23)

So y=-23 constant, x increasing from -22 to 23.

The cells: x= -22, -21, ..., 23.

(22,-23) is one of them.

Specifically, when x=22, y=-23.

Now, the sequence: start at (-23,-23), but this is already added? In the move right segment, we start at (-23,-23), which was added in the down segment.

Then we move to new cells: (-22,-23), (-21,-23), ..., (23,-23)

So first new cell: (-22,-23), last: (23,-23)

Number of cells: 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46, which is 2r=46 for r=23.

Now, the entire ring: start at (23,-22):2026

Then up move: adds 2r-1=45 cells? r=23, 2*23-1=45 cells: (23,-21) to (23,23)

Numbers: from 2027 to 2026 + 45 = 2071? Since start is 2026, up adds 45 cells, so numbers 2027 to 2026 + 45 = 2071? 2026 + 45 = 2071, but that's the last of up segment.

Cell count: start:1 cell, up adds 45 cells, total so far 46 cells, numbers 2026 to 2026 + 45 = 2071? The numbers: cell 1:2026, cell 2:2027, ..., cell 46:2026 + 45 = 2071? Since inclusive, from 2026 to 2071 is 2071-2026+1=46 cells, yes.

Last of up: (23,23):2071.

Then move left: to (22,23), (21,23), ..., to (-23,23)

Add cells: x=22 down to -23? From (23,23) to (22,23), etc., to (-23,23)

x from 22 to -23, decreasing.

Number: 22 - (-23) +1 = 22+23+1=46.

Numbers: next after 2071, so 2072 to 2071 + 46 = 2117? 2071 + 46 = 2117.

First: (22,23):2072, last: (-23,23):2117.

Then move down: from (-23,23) to (-23,22), (-23,21), ..., to (-23,-23)

Add cells: y=22 down to -23? y from 22 to -23, decreasing.

Number: 22 - (-23) +1 = 22+23+1=46.

Numbers: 2118 to 2117 + 46 = 2163? 2117 + 46 = 2163.

First: (-23,22):2118, last: (-23,-23):2163.

Then move right: from (-23,-23) to (-22,-23), (-21,-23), ..., to (23,-23)

Add cells: x= -22 to 23? From (-23,-23) to (-22,-23), etc., to (23,-23)

x from -22 to 23, increasing.

Number: 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46.

Numbers: next after 2163, so 2164 to 2163 + 46 = 2209? 2163 + 46 = 2209, yes.

First: (-22,-23):2164, last: (23,-23):2209.

Now, we need (22,-23)

This is in the move right segment, at (22,-23)

x=22, y=-23.

The cells in this segment: x from -22 to 23, y=-23.

x values: -22,-21,...,23.

The sequence: starts at x=-22: (-22,-23):2164

Then x=-21:2165, ..., up to x=23:2209.

Now, (22,-23): what x? x=22.

The x-values: -22,-21,-20,...,22,23.

So it's the second last? x=22, then x=23.

The smallest x is -22, largest 23.

The index: from x=-22 to x=23, inclusive.

Number of cells: 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46, as before.

The x-values: let me find the offset.

Set i = x - (-22) = x + 22

So when x=-22, i=0

x=-21, i=1

...

x=22, i=22 - (-22)? x+22=22+22=44? 

x min = -22, x max=23.

So i = x - (-22) = x + 22

Then i ranges from 0 to 23 - (-22) = 45? When x=-22, i=0

x=-21, i=1

...

x=23, i=23 - (-22) = 45? 23 + 22 =45, yes i=45.

So i from 0 to 45, total 46 values.

Now, number: first cell (x=-22,y=-23):2164

Then increases by 1 for each step.

So number = 2164 + i

For (22,-23), x=22, i=22 + 22 =44

So number = 2164 + 44 = 2208

Since it's the cell before last, and last is 2209 at (23,-23), so previous is 2208.

Yes.

So (22,-23):2208

Now, we have all neighbors in ring 23:

- (23,-21):2027

- (23,-23):2209

- (22,-23):2208

Now, finally, neighbors in ring 24.

Ring r=24.

Start at (24, -(24-1)) = (24, -23)

First number: n_start(24) = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Neighbors: (24,-22), (24,-21), (24,-23)

Note that (24,-23) is the start cell of ring 24.

Because start is at (24,-23)

So number is 2210.

Now, others: (24,-22) and (24,-21)

In ring 24, start at (24,-23)

Then move up: add cells with x=24, y from -23+1 = -22 to 24.

So y= -22, -21, ..., 24.

Now, (24,-22) and (24,-21) are both in this up segment.

Specifically:

Start cell: (24,-23):2210

Then move up to (24,-22):2211

Then (24,-21):2212

And so on, up to (24,24)

So (24,-22): first new cell, number 2211

(24,-21): next, number 2212

Now, we have all neighbors.

List them with their numbers:

1. Ring 22: (22,-22):2025

2. Ring 22: (22,-21):1850

3. Ring 23: (23,-21):2027

4. Ring 23: (23,-23):2209

5. Ring 23: (22,-23):2208

6. Ring 24: (24,-22):2211

7. Ring 24: (24,-21):2212

8. Ring 24: (24,-23):2210

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Write in order:

1850

2025

2027

2208

2209

2210

2211

2212

Now sum.

Notice that the last four are consecutive: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But we have five? No, 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But we have only four: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? List: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But we have five numbers ending with 2212? No:

From above: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But we have only one of each? The list has: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? But that's five numbers, but in neighbors we have: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212? 

Look: neighbors include:

- 2208: (22,-23)

- 2209: (23,-23)

- 2210: (24,-23)

- 2211: (24,-22)

- 2212: (24,-21)

So yes, five consecutive numbers: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Sum of five consecutive numbers: average is 2210, so sum = 5 * 2210 = 11050.

Now, the others: 1850, 2025, 2027.

Sum these: 1850 + 2025 + 2027.

First, 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Then 3875 + 2027 = 5902.

Now, total sum: 11050 + 5902 = 16952.

But let me compute carefully.

1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027: 3875 + 2000 = 5875, +27=5902, yes.

Then 2208 to 2212: let me sum: 2208+2212=4420, 2209+2211=4420, and 2210, so 4420 + 4420 = 8840, plus 2210 = 11050? 8840 + 2210 = 11050, yes.

Then total: 11050 + 5902 = 16952.

But is that all? We have eight neighbors: we summed five from the consecutive, and three others: 1850,2025,2027.

But earlier list: we have eight numbers: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212. Yes.

To confirm, sum all:

1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

2208 + 2212 = 4420

2209 + 2211 = 4420

2210 alone.

So 4420 + 4420 = 8840, plus 2210 = 11050? 8840 + 2210 = 11050, yes.

Then 5902 + 11050 = 16952.

Add the three and five: 5902 + 11050 = 16952.

Now, is this correct? But let me double-check the neighbors.

Original neighbors:

- (24,-22): ring 24, up segment, after start, first cell:2211? Earlier I said (24,-22):2211

- (22,-22): ring 22, last cell:2025

- (23,-21): ring 23, up segment, first new cell:2027? After start (23,-22):2026, then (23,-21):2027, yes.

- (23,-23): ring 23, last cell:2209

- (24,-21): ring 24, up segment, second new cell:2212? Start (24,-23):2210, then (24,-22):2211, then (24,-21):2212, yes.

- (24,-23): ring 24, start:2210

- (22,-21): ring 22, start:1850

- (22,-23): ring 23, move right segment, x=22,y=-23:2208

All seem correct.

Now, sum is 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212.

Now, group: 1850 is small, others larger.

Note that 2025,2027 are close to 2026, but 2026 itself is not included.

Sum = (1850) + (2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)

= 1850 + 4052 + ? 2025+2027=4052? 2025+2027=4052, yes.

Then the five consecutive: 2208 to 2212, sum = 5 * (2208 + 2212)/2? Average is 2210, sum=5*2210=11050.

2208+2212=4420, 2209+2211=4420, 2210=2210, total 4420+4420=8840 +2210=11050, yes.

So total: 1850 + 4052 + 11050.

First, 1850 + 4052 = 5902

Then 5902 + 11050 = 16952.

1850 + 4052: 1800+4000=5800, 50+52=102, total 5902.

5902 + 11050: 5900 + 11050 = 16950, plus 2? 16950 + 2 = 16952? No: 5902 + 11050 = (5900 + 11050) + 2 = 16950 + 2 = 16952, yes.

So sum is 16952.

But let me confirm with a smaller example to make sure.

For example, take n=1 at (0,0). Neighbors: as given: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Sum=44.

Now, according to our method, but n=1 is center, ring 0.

But our formula is for n in ring k≥1, but for center, neighbors are all in ring 1.

But for comparison, let's take n=2, which is first of ring 1.

n=2 at (1,0)

Neighbors: 

(2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,1), (2,-1), (0,1), (0,-1)

Now, numbers: 

(0,0):1

(1,1):3

(0,1):4

(-1,1):5? But (-1,0):6, etc.

In our spiral:

(2,0): should be in ring 2? max(|x|,|y|)=2, ring 2.

But ring 2 starts at n=10.

(0,0):1

(1,1):3

(0,1):4

(-1,1):5? Earlier for ring 1.

(1,-1):9? In our initial, (1,-1):9

(0,-1):8

(-1,-1):7

(-1,0):6

(2,0): ring 2, start? Ring 2 starts at (2,-1):10? But (2,0) is not start.

Similarly, (2,1), (2,-1), etc.

So neighbors of (1,0):

- (2,0): ring 2, position? In ring 2, start (2,-1):10, then move up: to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)? For r=2, start (2,-1), move up to y=-1+1=0? y from 0 to 2? s_y=-(2-1)=-1, move up: y from -1+1=0 to 2, so (2,0),(2,1),(2,2)

Numbers: start (2,-1):10, then (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13? Earlier I had (2,0):11, yes.

- (0,0):1

- (1,1):3

- (1,-1):9? In ring 1, (1,-1):9

- (2,1):12? As above

- (2,-1):10? Start of ring 2

- (0,1):4

- (0,-1):8

So neighbors: (2,0):11, (0,0):1, (1,1):3, (1,-1):9, (2,1):12, (2,-1):10, (0,1):4, (0,-1):8

Sum: 11,1,3,9,12,10,4,8

Sum: 1+3+4+8+9+10+11+12

Calculate: 1+3=4, +4=8, +8=16, +9=25, +10=35, +11=46, +12=58.

But earlier for center 1, neighbors sum to 44, but here for n=2, it should be different.

Is this correct? The neighbors of n=2 at (1,0) should be adjacent cells.

In the grid, (1,0) neighbors: 

East: (2,0):11? But in initial small grid, when n=9 is placed, but for larger, yes.

But for n=2, its neighbors include 1,3, and others.

From the sequence: n=2 at (1,0), adjacent: left: (0,0):1, up: (1,1):3, down: (1,-1): but at that time, (1,-1) might not be filled yet? When n=2 is placed, only up to n=2, so neighbors not filled.

But in the final grid, the neighbors are filled later, but for the completed spiral, the neighbors exist.

In this case, for n=2, neighbors are: north: (1,1):3, south: (1,-1):9, east: (2,0):11, west: (0,0):1, northeast: (2,1):12, southeast: (2,-1):10, northwest: (0,1):4, southwest: (0,-1):8.

Same as above.

Sum:1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12. Sum: let's add: 1+12=13, 3+11=14, 4+10=14, 8+9=17, total 13+14=27, +14=41, +17=58.

Now, according to our method for n=2, first of ring k=1.

Position (1,0)

Neighbors: 

(2,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (2,1), (2,-1), (0,1), (0,-1)

Same as above.

In rings:

- (2,0): ring max(2,0)=2, ring 2

- (0,0): ring max(0,0)=0, ring 0

- (1,1): ring max(1,1)=1, ring 1

- (1,-1): ring max(1,1)=1? |x|=1,|y|=1,max=1, ring 1

- (2,1): ring max(2,1)=2, ring 2

- (2,-1): ring max(2,1)=2, ring 2

- (0,1): ring max(0,1)=1, ring 1

- (0,-1): ring max(0,1)=1, ring 1

Now, compute each:

- (0,0): ring 0, only cell, number 1.

- Ring 1: neighbors: (1,1),(1,-1),(0,1),(0,-1)

Ring r=1, start at (1,0):2? But (1,0) is n=2 itself.

For (1,1): position in ring 1.

Start (1,0):2

Move up: to (1,1):3? Since only one cell added, number 3.

Similarly, (0,1): after that, move left: to (0,1):4? In sequence: after (1,1), move left to (0,1):4? Earlier we had (0,1):4.

But according to the segment: after up, at (1,1), then move left: to (0,1), then to (-1,1)

So (0,1) is the first cell in left move, number? After (1,1):3, next is (0,1):4.

Similarly, (1,-1): in the down or right? After left and down, ends at (1,-1):9? Sequence: after left to (-1,1), then down to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, then right to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So (1,-1): last cell, number 9.

Similarly, (0,-1): before that, (0,-1):8? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1):8, then to (1,-1):9.

So (0,-1):8.

Now, ring 2: neighbors (2,0),(2,1),(2,-1)

Ring r=2, start at (2,-1):10

Move up: to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13

So (2,0):11, (2,1):12

(2,-1):10, which is start.

So numbers: (0,0):1, (1,1):3, (1,-1):9, (0,1):4, (0,-1):8, (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,-1):10

Same as before, sum 1+3+9+4+8+11+12+10= let's add: 1+3=4,4+4=8,8+8=16,16+9=25,25+10=35,35+11=46,46+12=58, same as before.

Now, for n=2026, we have sum 16952, which seems consistent.

But in our calculation, we have neighbors summing to 16952.

Now, is there any mistake? For example, (22,-21) is ring 22 start, 1850, which is correct.

(22,-22) is ring 22 end, 2025.

(23,-21) is ring 23, second cell, 2027.

(23,-23) is ring 23 end, 2209.

(22,-23) is ring 23, near end, 2208.

(24,-23) is ring 24 start, 2210.

(24,-22) is ring 24, second cell, 2211.

(24,-21) is ring 24, third cell, 2212.

All seem correct.

Sum: as computed, 16952.

But let me add them numerically:

1850

+2025 = 3875

+2027 = 5902

+2208 = 8110

+2209 = 10319

+2210 = 12529

+2211 = 14740

+2212 = 16952

Yes, confirms.

So the sum is 16952.

But the problem is to sum the neighbors of 2026, and we got 16952.

Now, is this reasonable? 2026 is about 2000, neighbors are around 2000, average say 2000, 8 neighbors, sum about 16000, and 16952 is close, so plausible.

Since we have five consecutive numbers around 2210, sum 5*2210=11050, and others 1850,2025,2027: 1850+2025=3875, +2027=5902, total 11050+5902=16952.

Note that 2025 and 2027 are symmetric around 2026, but 2026 itself not included, so 2025+2027=4052=2*2026? 2*2026=4052, yes exactly.

2025 + 2027 = 2026 -1 + 2026 +1 = 2*2026 = 4052.

Then 1850 is fixed.

Then the others: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

2210 is 2026 + 184? 2026 + 184 = 2210? 2000+184=2184, no.

2026 + ? 2210 - 2026 = 184, yes.

But anyway, sum is 2208+2209+2210+2211+2212.

This is an arithmetic series: first 2208, last 2212, number 5, sum = 5/2 * (2208 + 2212) = 5/2 * 4420 = 5 * 2210 = 11050.

Then total sum: 1850 + 4052 + 11050 = 1850 + 4052 = 5902, +11050=16952.

Since 4052=2*2026, so sum = 1850 + 2*2026 + 11050.

But no need.

So the answer should be 16952.

But let me confirm the ring for n=2026.

n=2026, ring k=23, since first of ring 23 is (2*23-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026, yes.

Position (23,-22)

Neighbors as above.

Another neighbor is (22,-23), which we have as 2208, but is it adjacent? (22,-23) and (23,-22), difference in x and y: dx=1, dy=1, so diagonal, yes adjacent.

Similarly others.

So I think correct.

Thus, the sum is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, as it is the first number in ring 23. The ring starts at \((k, -(k-1))\) for ring \(k\), and for \(k=23\), this is \((23, -22)\). The first number of ring \(k\) is given by \((2k-1)^2 + 1\), which for \(k=23\) is \(45^2 + 1 = 2025 + 1 = 2026\).

The eight neighbors of \((23, -22)\) are:
- \((24, -22)\)
- \((22, -22)\)
- \((23, -21)\)
- \((23, -23)\)
- \((24, -21)\)
- \((24, -23)\)
- \((22, -21)\)
- \((22, -23)\)

The ring for each neighbor is determined by \(r = \max(|x|, |y|)\), and the corresponding numbers are found based on their positions within their respective rings:

- \((22, -22)\): In ring 22, which ends at \((2 \times 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025\). This is the last cell of ring 22, so the number is 2025.
- \((22, -21)\): In ring 22, starting at \((22, -21)\) with number \((2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1849 + 1 = 1850\). This is the start cell, so the number is 1850.
- \((23, -21)\): In ring 23, starting at \((23, -22)\) with number 2026. Moving up, the first new cell is \((23, -21)\), so the number is 2027.
- \((23, -23)\): In ring 23, ending at \((23, -23)\) with number \((2 \times 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209\). This is the last cell, so the number is 2209.
- \((22, -23)\): In ring 23, during the right move segment. The segment starts at \((-23, -23)\) with number 2163 (from previous segments), and the cells are added with increasing \(x\) from \(-22\) to \(23\) at \(y = -23\). For \((22, -23)\), \(x = 22\), the offset \(i = x + 22 = 44\), so the number is \(2163 + 44 + 1 = 2208\) (since the first cell in this segment is at \(x = -22\), number 2164).
- \((24, -23)\): In ring 24, starting at \((24, -23)\) with number \((2 \times 24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2209 + 1 = 2210\). This is the start cell, so the number is 2210.
- \((24, -22)\): In ring 24, starting at \((24, -23)\) with number 2210. Moving up, the first new cell is \((24, -22)\), so the number is 2211.
- \((24, -21)\): In ring 24, continuing up from \((24, -22)\), the next cell is \((24, -21)\), so the number is 2212.

The neighbors and their numbers are:
- \((22, -22)\): 2025
- \((22, -21)\): 1850
- \((23, -21)\): 2027
- \((23, -23)\): 2209
- \((22, -23)\): 2208
- \((24, -23)\): 2210
- \((24, -22)\): 2211
- \((24, -21)\): 2212

Summing these numbers:
\[
1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212
\]

Grouping the terms:
- \(1850\)
- \(2025 + 2027 = 4052\)
- \(2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 5 \times 2210 = 11050\) (since these are five consecutive numbers centered at 2210)

Adding together:
\[
1850 + 4052 = 5902
\]
\[
5902 + 11050 = 16952
\]

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
