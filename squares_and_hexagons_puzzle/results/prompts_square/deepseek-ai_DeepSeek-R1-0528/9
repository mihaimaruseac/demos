<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand the layout of the spiral. From the snippet, it seems that 1 is at the center, and the numbers spiral outward clockwise. Let me sketch this out.

Assuming 1 is at (0,0), then moving right to 2 at (1,0), down to 3? No, looking at the grid:

It shows 5,4,3 in one row, then 6,1,2 below, and 7,8,9 below that. So probably:

Row above: ... 5 4 3 ... but it's a spiral, so likely it's not aligned that way. Perhaps the grid is oriented such that the center is at 1, and it spirals out.

Let me list the numbers around:

From the center 1, right is 2, down is 8? The grid shows:

Position: let's say columns x, rows y.

Set (0,0) as 1.

Then to the right, (1,0) is 2.

Below (1,0) is? The next row has 7,8,9. Below 1 is 8? The grid is:

Probably:

y=1: ... 5 4 3 ... so for x, say x=0:3, x=1:4, x=2:5? But that might not be centered.

Standard Ulam spiral is usually with 1 at center, spiraling counterclockwise or clockwise. In this case, from the snippet: above 1 is 6? The grid shows:

Row above 1: 6 1 2? No: it says "...6 1 2..." but that's the same row? No, it's written as:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So likely, the middle row is y=0: x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2

Above that, y=1: x=-1:5? x=0:4? x=1:3? But it shows 5,4,3, so probably x=-2:?, but it starts with 5, so perhaps for y=1, x=0:4, x=1:3? But then 5 is at x=-1,y=1?

Let's define coordinates.

Assume the center 1 is at (0,0).

Then to the east (right) is 2, so (1,0)=2.

Then the next number is 3, which is north? But above 2 is probably 3? In the grid, above 1 is 6? Confusion.

The grid shows directly above 1 is 6? In the second row, it's "...6 1 2...", so if 1 is at (0,0), then left of it is 6 at (-1,0), right is 2 at (1,0).

Then the row above: "...5 4 3...", so above 6 is 5? Above 1 is 4? Above 2 is 3? So positions: (-1,1)=5, (0,1)=4, (1,1)=3.

Then below: "...7 8 9...", so below 6 is 7? Below 1 is 8? Below 2 is 9? So (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

But what about 10? Probably next to 9, but not shown. So the spiral continues. From 9, it should go left to 10,11,etc, but let's see the sequence.

After 3, which is at (1,1), next number should be 4? But 4 is at (0,1), which is already placed. I think I have a mistake.

The numbers are placed in order: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...

From the grid, at (0,0):1, (1,0):2, then (1,1):3? But in the grid, (1,1) is 3, (0,1) is 4, (-1,1) is 5, then (-1,0) is 6, (-1,-1) is 7, (0,-1) is 8, (1,-1) is 9.

But what about 10? After 9 at (1,-1), it should go left to (0,-1), but that's already 8, so down or something. Probably it goes to (2,-1) or something. Let's list the positions in order.

Start at (0,0):1

Move right to (1,0):2

Then up to (1,1):3? But in grid, (1,1) is 3, good.

Then left to (0,1):4? Grid has 4 at (0,1), good.

Then left to (-1,1):5, good.

Then down to (-1,0):6, good.

Then down to (-1,-1):7, good.

Then right to (0,-1):8, good.

Then right to (1,-1):9, good.

Now next should be 10. From (1,-1), if it continues right, to (2,-1):10.

Then up? To (2,0):11? But (2,0) is not yet filled, then (2,1):12, but (2,1) might be above.

After 9 at (1,-1), to go to 10, it should continue the spiral. Typically, after going down the left side, it would turn right, but since it's spiraling outward, from (1,-1), it should go up to (1,0), but (1,0) is already occupied by 2, so it must go to (2,-1).

Then from (2,-1), it needs to go up. So to (2,0):10? But 10 is next, so (2,-1):10.

Then to (2,0):11? But (2,0) is east of (2,-1), but direction might be changing.

Standard spiral: after completing a layer, it moves to the next.

From (1,-1), since down and left are blocked or already filled, but in this case, south is empty? (1,-2) is empty, but typically it moves to the next ring.

Recall the movement: usually, it moves in directions: right, up, left, down, and each direction the step size increases.

Specifically, for a spiral starting at center, moving right 1 step, up 1 step, left 2 steps, down 2 steps, right 3 steps, up 3 steps, left 4 steps, down 4 steps, and so on.

In this case:

Start at (0,0):1

Move right 1 step: to (1,0):2

Move up 1 step: to (1,1):3

Move left 2 steps: to (0,1):4, then to (-1,1):5

Move down 2 steps: to (-1,0):6, then to (-1,-1):7

Move right 2 steps: to (0,-1):8, then to (1,-1):9

Now, next move should be up, but since the step size increases after completing a "circle", but here after down 2 steps, next is right, but we just did right? The pattern is: after down, next direction is right, but with increased step size.

After moving down 2 steps (to 7 and 8? From (-1,-1) move right to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9, that was 2 steps right? But initially right was 1 step, then up 1, left 2, down 2, so next should be right 3 steps.

From (1,-1), move right to (2,-1):10, (3,-1):11, (4,-1):12? But only 3 steps? From (1,-1) to (2,-1):10, (3,-1):11, (4,-1):12. Then next direction is up, with 3 steps: to (4,0):13, (4,1):14, (4,2):15. Then left 4 steps: to (3,2):16, (2,2):17, (1,2):18, (0,2):19. Then down 4 steps: to (0,1): but (0,1) is already occupied by 4, so to (0,0)? No, should be (0,1) down to (0,0) but occupied, so probably to (0,-1)? But occupied.

Mistake: after (0,2):19, move down to (0,1): but (0,1) has 4, which is already there. But in the sequence, after 19, it should be 20 at (0,1)? But occupied. So I must have wrong direction or step.

Perhaps the directions are cyclic: after down, next is right, but step size increases only after completing a full set.

Standard Ulam spiral: the step size increases every two turns. Let me think.

I recall that for a spiral, the layer k has numbers from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

For example, center 1 is layer 0? Or layer 1.

At center, n=1, which is at "layer" 0 or 1.

The numbers on the axes.

I could find the position of a given number.

Let me define the spiral movement.

Set direction vectors: let’s say east (1,0), north (0,1), west (-1,0), south (0,-1).

Start at (0,0) with n=1.

Move east 1 step: to (1,0): n=2

Then north 1 step: to (1,1): n=3

Then west 2 steps: to (0,1): n=4, then (-1,1): n=5

Then south 2 steps: to (-1,0): n=6, then (-1,-1): n=7

Then east 2 steps: to (0,-1): n=8, then (1,-1): n=9

Now, step size increases to 3.

Next direction is north (since after south is east, but we just did east? The sequence of directions is repeating: east, north, west, south, and after each pair of directions, step size increases.

After moving south, next is east, but step size increases from 2 to 3.

So move east 3 steps: from (1,-1) to (2,-1): n=10, (3,-1): n=11, (4,-1): n=12

Then north 3 steps: from (4,-1) to (4,0): n=13, (4,1): n=14, (4,2): n=15

Then west 3 steps: from (4,2) to (3,2): n=16, (2,2): n=17, (1,2): n=18

Then south 3 steps: from (1,2) to (1,1): but (1,1) is already n=3, occupied. Problem.

South from (1,2) should go to (1,1), but occupied, so it should go to (1,0)? Also occupied. So must be that after west, it moves south, but to (1,1) is occupied, so it should continue to (1,0), but occupied, or to (1,-1)? All occupied. So I have a mistake in the direction sequence.

Perhaps after west, it moves south, but since the step size is 3, it should move three steps south, but from (1,2), south to (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), all of which are already filled. But in reality, it should move to new cells. So the direction must be different.

I recall that in some spirals, after moving west on the top, it moves south on the left, but in this case, after (1,2), it should move down to (1,1), but occupied, so perhaps it turns earlier.

For n=18 at (1,2), next should be south, but since (1,1) is occupied, it must go to (0,2) or something. Let's calculate the next number.

From the initial grid, after 9 at (1,-1), next is 10 at (2,-1), then 11 at (3,-1), 12 at (4,-1), then 13 at (4,0), 14 at (4,1), 15 at (4,2), then 16 at (3,2), 17 at (2,2), 18 at (1,2), then next should be down, but to (1,1) is occupied, so it must go to (0,2)? But (0,2) is north of (1,2)? No, west is (0,2), but west is already done. Perhaps it turns down at (1,2) to (1,1), but occupied, so it must be that the step size is not yet increased, or the direction is different.

Another way: perhaps the spiral is clockwise or counter-clockwise. In the given grid, from 1 to 2 is east, then from 2 to 3 is north? But in the grid, 2 is at (1,0), 3 is at (1,1), so yes north. Then to 4 is west to (0,1), then to 5 west to (-1,1), then to 6 south to (-1,0), to 7 south to (-1,-1), to 8 east to (0,-1), to 9 east to (1,-1), then to 10, which should be south or east? If it continues east to (2,-1):10, then to (3,-1):11, (4,-1):12, then from there, since it was moving east, next should be north, to (4,0):13, (4,1):14, (4,2):15, then west to (3,2):16, (2,2):17, (1,2):18, then from (1,2), if it continues west, but west would be to (0,2), which is empty, so to (0,2):19, then to (-1,2):20, but then it would hit the left side.

But in the initial part, when it was at (-1,1), it turned down, but here at (1,2), if it goes west to (0,2):19, (-1,2):20, then it should turn south, to (-1,1): but (-1,1) is already 5, occupied. Same problem.

So perhaps after (1,2):18, it turns south to (1,1), but occupied, or down to (1,1), occupied, so it must be that the next move is south, but only for 2 steps or something.

I recall that for the Ulam spiral, the step size increases after each "arm", but the first arm has size 1, then size 2 for the next two arms, then size 3 for the next two, etc.

Let's list the cumulative steps.

For the first move: east 1 step: positions 1 to 2.

Then north 1 step: 3.

Then west 2 steps: 4 and 5.

Then south 2 steps: 6 and 7.

Then east 2 steps: 8 and 9.

Now, next should be north, but with increased step size. From 9 at (1,-1), move north to (1,0): but (1,0) is 2, occupied. So it must move east instead, with larger step size.

Perhaps after completing the south arm, it moves east with step size 3.

From (1,-1), move east to (2,-1):10, (3,-1):11, (4,-1):12.

Then from there, move north to (4,0):13, (4,1):14, (4,2):15.

Then move west to (3,2):16, (2,2):17, (1,2):18.

Now, from (1,2), it should move south, but south to (1,1): occupied, so perhaps it moves south with step size 3, but only for the remaining, or it turns.

From (1,2), since (1,1) is occupied, it must move to a new cell, so likely it moves south to (1,1), but that's occupied, so perhaps the direction is down, but to (1,1) is not down, it's south, same thing.

Perhaps at this point, it should move south, but since (1,1) is occupied, it moves to (1,0)? Also occupied, or (1,-1)? occupied. So for n=19, it should be at (0,2) or (2,2) but those are filled later.

Let's calculate where 10 is. From the pattern, after 9 at (1,-1), 10 at (2,-1), 11 at (3,-1), 12 at (4,-1), 13 at (4,0), 14 at (4,1), 15 at (4,2), 16 at (3,2), 17 at (2,2), 18 at (1,2), then 19 at (0,2), 20 at (-1,2), then 21 at (-1,1)? but (-1,1) is 5, occupied. So not.

After 18 at (1,2), it should go down to (1,1), but occupied, so perhaps it goes to (0,2) first? But (0,2) is west, and west was already done in this arm.

Perhaps the next direction after west is south, but for this layer, the south arm is shorter.

For layer k, the side length is 2k+1.

Let me define the "ring" or "layer".

Let k be the layer, starting from 0.

For k=0, only n=1 at (0,0).

For k=1, numbers from 2 to 9, forming a 3x3 grid, but not filled, only the perimeter.

The numbers on the perimeter of the square from (-1,-1) to (1,1), but not including the center.

The first ring (k=1) has numbers 2 to 9, at positions: (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), which is 8 numbers, and it's a square of side 3, but only the boundary, with 8 cells.

The size of the ring is from ( -k, -k) to (k,k), but for k=1, from -1 to 1, and the boundary has 8 cells, while numbers from 2 to 9 are 8 numbers, so yes.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2.

For k=1, (2*1+1)^2 = 3^2=9, yes.

The first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

For k=1, (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1^2+1=2, yes.

For k=2, first number (2*2-1)^2 +1 =3^2+1=10, last number (2*2+1)^2=5^2=25.

And so on.

Now, for a given n, I can find which ring it is in.

The ring k is when (2k-1)^2 < n ≤ (2k+1)^2.

For n=2026, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Compute squares.

First, find the smallest m such that m^2 >= 2026.

sqrt(2026) ≈ ? 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025 is 45^2, so 2026 > 2025, so for the inequality.

(2k-1)^2 < n ≤ (2k+1)^2.

Set m = 2k+1, then n ≤ m^2, and (m-2)^2 < n, since 2k-1 = m-2.

For n=2026, since 45^2=2025, and 2025 is a square, so if m=45, then n≤m^2=2025, but 2026 > 2025, so n > m^2, so m must be larger.

If m=47? m=2k+1 must be odd, since squares of odd numbers.

2k+1 is always odd, yes.

45 is odd, 45^2=2025.

2026 > 2025, so n > (2k+1)^2 for k such that 2k+1=45? Let me set.

Let s = 2k+1, then s is odd, and (s-2)^2 < n ≤ s^2.

s^2 >= n, and (s-2)^2 < n.

For n=2026, s^2 >= 2026, s>=46, but s odd, so s=47? 47^2=2209.

(s-2)^2 =45^2=2025 < 2026? 2025 < 2026, yes.

s^2=47^2=2209 >=2026, yes.

But is n ≤ s^2? 2026 ≤ 2209, yes.

But for s=45, s^2=2025 < 2026, so n > s^2, so not in that ring.

s=45 would give n ≤ 2025, but 2026 > 2025, so next ring.

s=47, then (s-2)^2 =45^2=2025 < 2026 ≤ 47^2=2209, yes.

So ring k where 2k+1=s=47, so k=(s-1)/2=(47-1)/2=46/2=23.

So k=23.

First number in ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1.

2k-1=2*23-1=46-1=45, so 45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Exactly the first number of the ring.

So n=2026 is the first number in ring k=23.

Now, what is the position of the first number in a ring.

In the spiral, each ring starts at a specific position.

For ring k, it starts at the east side, specifically at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

Recall for small k.

For k=1, starts at (1,0) with n=2.

k=2, starts at (2,-1) with n=10? Earlier we had (2,-1):10.

k=3, first number is (2*3-1)^2 +1=5^2+1=26.

Where is it? After ring k=2 ends at (2,2) with n=25? Last number is (2k+1)^2=25 for k=2.

Position: for k=2, last number should be at the corner.

In ring k=2, numbers from 10 to 25.

Starts at (2,-1):10, then east? Earlier: (2,-1):10, (3,-1):11, (4,-1):12? But s=2k+1=5, so from -2 to 2? Coordinates from -2 to 2.

Typically, for ring k, the min and max coordinate is from -k to k, inclusive? For k=1, -1 to 1, yes.

For k=2, -2 to 2.

Starts at (2,-1)? But x=2, y=-1.

Then moves north? In our earlier assumption, after east, north.

From (2,-1):10, move north to (2,0):11? But earlier I thought (4,-1):12, inconsistency.

Let's compute for k=2.

Ring k=2, first number 10 at (2,-1)? But according to standard, often it starts at (k, 1-k) or something.

For k=1, starts at (1,0) = (k, 0) since k=1.

y=0.

For k=2, should start at (2, -1)? y=-1.

k=3, (3,-2)? etc.

Now direction: for each ring, it starts by moving in a certain direction.

In this spiral, it always starts by moving east? For k=1, from (0,0) to (1,0), east.

Then for k=2, from where? After ring k=1 ends at (1,-1):9.

Then to start ring k=2, it moves east to (2,-1):10.

Similarly, for k=3, after ring k=2 ends, say at (2,2):25? Then moves east to (3,2)? But earlier for k=3, first is 26 at (3,-2)? Not consistent.

Where does ring k end? The last number is at a corner.

For ring k, the last number is at (-k, -k) or something.

For k=1, ends at (1,-1):9? But (-1,-1) is 7, not end.

The order: in ring k=1: starts (1,0):2, then (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9. So ends at (1,-1).

Then ring k=2 starts at (2,-1):10? Then moves north? To (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13? Then west to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17? Then south to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20? Then east to (-1,-1): but occupied by 7, problem.

After (-2,2):17, if move south to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, then east to (-1,-1): but (-1,-1) is already 7, occupied.

But should go to (-1,-1), occupied, so mistake.

Perhaps after west, it moves south, but for k=2, side length should be 5, but the step sizes.

In ring k, the first move is east, with step size 2k-1? For k=1, step size 1: move east 1 step.

Then north with step size 2k-1? For k=1, north 1 step.

Then west with step size 2k? For k=1, west 2 steps? But earlier it was 2 steps for west and south.

For ring k, the four moves:

- Move east: number of steps = 2k - 1? For k=1, 2*1 -1=1 step, yes.

- Then move north: 2k -1 steps? For k=1, 1 step, yes.

- Then move west: 2k steps? For k=1, 2 steps, yes.

- Then move south: 2k steps? For k=1, 2 steps, yes.

But after south, it ends, and for k=2, east: 2*2-1=3 steps, north: 2*2-1=3 steps, west: 2*2=4 steps, south: 4 steps.

But total cells in ring: for k=2, should have 8k cells? General ring k has how many cells?

The ring from -k to k, the perimeter has 8k cells, since each side has 2k+1 cells, but corners shared, so total 4*(2k+1) - 4 = 8k +4 -4 =8k cells.

For k=1, 8 cells, yes.

For k=2, 16 cells, from n=10 to 25, 16 numbers, yes.

With moves: east 3 steps, north 3 steps, west 4 steps, south 4 steps? 3+3+4+4=14, but should be 16 cells? Steps mean number of moves, but each move to a new cell, so number of cells covered is number of steps plus one? No.

When we say "move east s steps", it means we move s times, each time to a new cell, so we cover s cells in that direction, but since we start from a cell, the number of cells added is s.

In the sequence, we start at the starting cell, then move s steps in a direction, each step to a new cell, so we add s new cells.

For example, in k=1: start at (1,0): already counted? Typically, the starting cell is included in the first move.

For ring k, we start at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

Standard way: for ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k) or (k, k-1)? Let's see.

For k=1, start at (1,0) = (k, 0) = (k, 1-k) since 1-1=0.

For k=2, should start at (2, 1-2)=(2,-1), which matches our earlier 10.

Now, from there, move east? But east would be increasing x, but it's already at x=k, and moving east would go to x=k+1, but that's outside the ring.

The directions: for ring k, the moves are:

- First, move east? But in k=1, from (1,0), we moved north to (1,1), not east.

After starting, we move in a direction.

In k=1: start at (1,0):2, then move north to (1,1):3.

Then move west to (0,1):4, (-1,1):5.

Then move south to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7.

Then move east to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So directions: north, west, south, east.

The sequence is north, then west, then south, then east.

And for each, the number of steps: for k=1, north:1 step (to (1,1)), west:2 steps (to (0,1),(-1,1)), south:2 steps (to (-1,0),(-1,-1)), east:2 steps (to (0,-1),(1,-1)).

But the last move east has 2 steps, but total cells: start plus moves: 1 start +1 north +2 west +2 south +2 east =8, good.

But the number of steps per direction: north:1, west:2, south:2, east:2. Not symmetric.

For k=2: start at (2,-1):10.

Then move north: how many steps? If same ratio, but for k=1, north had 1 step, others 2.

Perhaps for ring k, the moves are:

- North: k steps? For k=1, k=1 step.

- West: 2k -1 steps? For k=1, 2*1-1=1, but we had 2, no.

Total steps: since total cells 8k, and four moves, but moves have different lengths.

From the pattern: for k=1: north:1, west:2, south:2, east:2.

For k=2: probably north:2, west:3, south:3, east:4? Or something.

Let's calculate total: if north a, west b, south c, east d, a+b+c+d = total moves, but each move adds that many cells, and start is separate, so a+b+c+d = number of cells added by moves, total cells is 1 (start) + a + b + c + d = 8k.

For k=1, 1 + a+b+c+d =8, so a+b+c+d=7.

With a=1 (north), b=2 (west), c=2 (south), d=2 (east), sum=7, good.

For k=2, total moves sum a+b+c+d = 8*2 -1 =15? Since total cells 16, start + moves =16, so moves sum to 15.

Now, what are a,b,c,d? Likely proportional or pattern.

In k=1, north:1, west:2, south:2, east:2.

For k=2, perhaps north:2, west:3, south:3, east:4? Sum 2+3+3+4=12<15, not enough.

North:3, west:4, south:4, east:4? Sum 15, possible.

But let's verify with actual positions.

Start at (2,-1):10.

Move north: north means increase y. So move north s steps: each step to (x,y+1).

So from (2,-1), move north: to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13? If 3 steps, then to (2,-1+1)=(2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13. So three cells:11,12,13.

Then move west: decrease x. From (2,2), move west to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17? If 4 steps, then to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17.

Then move south: decrease y. From (-2,2), move south to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21? If 4 steps, to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21.

Then move east: increase x. From (-2,-2), move east to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25? If 4 steps, to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25.

Now, is this correct? The last number is 25, at (2,-2). But earlier for ring k=1, ended at (1,-1). Now (2,-2) is different corner.

But in this, we have cells: start (2,-1):10, north to (2,0):11,(2,1):12,(2,2):13, west to (1,2):14,(0,2):15,(-1,2):16,(-2,2):17, south to (-2,1):18,(-2,0):19,(-2,-1):20,(-2,-2):21, east to (-1,-2):22,(0,-2):23,(1,-2):24,(2,-2):25.

All positions within -2 to 2, and no duplicates, and covers all boundary cells? The boundary of [-2,2]x[-2,2] should have cells where |x|=2 or |y|=2, but not both? No, corners are included.

Total cells: for x=2, y=-1,0,1,2: four cells? But y from -2 to 2, so five y-values, but since it's a grid, each side has 5 cells, but corners shared.

Standard: for a square from -k to k, inclusive, the number of cells is (2k+1)^2, but the ring (boundary) has that minus the inner square.

Inner square to k-1 has (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2 cells, so boundary is (2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2 = [4k^2 + 4k +1] - [4k^2 -4k +1] = 8k, yes.

For k=2, boundary cells: all (x,y) with |x|<=2, |y|<=2, and max(|x|,|y|)=2.

In our list: we have (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — that's x=2, y=-1,0,1,2.

But missing y=-2? When x=2, y=-2 is not included yet.

In east move, we ended at (2,-2), but we have (2,-1) already.

List all cells:

From start: (2,-1)

North: (2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — so (2,y) for y=-1,0,1,2? y from -1 to 2, missing y=-2.

Then west: (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — so x from 2 to -2? x=1,0,-1,-2 at y=2.

But (2,2) is already included, so we start from (2,2), move west to (1,2), etc.

Then south: from (-2,2) to (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2) — so y from 2 to -2? y=1,0,-1,-2 at x=-2.

Then east: from (-2,-2) to (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2) — so x from -2 to 2? x=-1,0,1,2 at y=-2.

Now, list all: 

- (2,-1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) — x=2, y=-1,0,1,2

- (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2) — but (2,2) already, so new: x=1,0,-1,-2 at y=2

- (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2) — new: y=1,0,-1,-2 at x=-2 (since (-2,2) already)

- (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) — new: x=-1,0,1,2 at y=-2 (since (-2,-2) already)

Now, total cells: 

- Top row y=2: x=-2,-1,0,1,2 → 5 cells

- Bottom row y=-2: x=-2,-1,0,1,2 → 5 cells

- Left column x=-2: y=-2,-1,0,1,2 → but y=2 and y=-2 already counted, so y=-1,0,1 → 3 cells? But we have (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1) in south move, and (-2,2) in west, (-2,-2) in south? In south move we have (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2), so all y for x=-2.

Similarly for right column.

But in the list, for x=2: we have y=-1,0,1,2 from start and north, but missing y=-2? In east move, we have (2,-2), so it is included.

Similarly, for y=-2: we have x=-2,-1,0,1,2 from east and south moves.

Specifically:

- Cells with x=2: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,-2) — all y from -2 to 2? y=-2,-1,0,1,2, but we have five: in start: (2,-1), north: (2,0),(2,1),(2,2), and east: (2,-2). So yes, all five.

Similarly for others.

But in the sequence, we covered: start: (2,-1), then north: (2,0),(2,1),(2,2), then west: (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2), then south: (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2), then east: (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2).

Now, is (2,-2) included? Yes. Are all boundary cells covered? For example, (1,-2) is in east move: (1,-2):24. (0,-2):23, etc. What about (-1,-2):22, yes. And ( -2,-1):20, etc. So yes, all covered, no duplicates.

Numbers: 10 at start, then north 3 steps: 11,12,13? Three cells, so n=11,12,13.

But total moves: north:3 steps, meaning three moves, adding three cells: from (2,-1) move north to (2,0):11, then to (2,1):12, then to (2,2):13. So cells added:11,12,13.

Then west:4 steps? From (2,2) move west to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17. So four cells:14,15,16,17.

Then south:4 steps? From (-2,2) move south to (-2,1):18, (-2,0):19, (-2,-1):20, (-2,-2):21. Four cells:18,19,20,21.

Then east:4 steps? From (-2,-2) move east to (-1,-2):22, (0,-2):23, (1,-2):24, (2,-2):25. Four cells:22,23,24,25.

Total: start 10, plus 3+4+4+4=15 moves, total 16 cells, good.

Now for k=1: start (1,0):2, north:1 step to (1,1):3, west:2 steps to (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, south:2 steps to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, east:2 steps to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

Here north:1 step, west:2, south:2, east:2.

So pattern: for ring k, the moves are:

- North: k steps? k=1:1, k=2:3? But we have 3 for k=2, but k=1 is 1, not consistent.

k=1: north:1, west:2, south:2, east:2

k=2: north:3, west:4, south:4, east:4

So north has k? But 1 and 3, not linear.

North: 2k-1? k=1:1, k=2:3, yes.

West: for k=1:2, k=2:4, so 2k.

Similarly south:2k, east:2k.

But for k=1, west=2, south=2, east=2, which is 2k=2.

North=2k-1=1.

For k=3, north:2*3-1=5 steps, west:6, south:6, east:6.

Total moves:5+6+6+6=23, plus start, total 24 cells. For k=3, should have 8*3=24 cells, yes.

Now, back to our problem.

n=2026 is the first number of ring k=23.

So it starts at (k, 1-k) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22)

Now, direction: it moves north first, with number of steps: for north, it's 2k-1 = 2*23 -1=46-1=45 steps.

But since we need the neighbors of n=2026, which is at the start position (23,-22).

The neighbors are the eight adjacent cells: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

But some may be occupied, some may not, but since it's a grid, all cells exist, but may not have numbers yet or may be in different rings.

Specifically, since it's the start of the ring, and the ring is on the boundary, so some neighbors might be inside the ring, some outside.

The position is (23,-22)

The eight neighbors are:

(23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-22), (24,-22), (22,-23), (24,-23), (22,-21), (24,-21)

In grid coordinates, adjacent horizontally, vertically, diagonally.

Now, which of these have numbers? Since n=2026 is the first of its ring, the previous ring is k=22, which ends at some position.

We need to know what numbers are in those cells.

Since the spiral is filled sequentially, the neighbors could be from the same ring or previous rings.

Specifically, for a cell on the boundary of ring k, its neighbors could be in ring k-1 or ring k or ring k+1, but since ring k+1 hasn't started yet (because n=2026 is first of ring k=23), so no numbers in ring k+1 yet.

Ring k=23 starts at n=2026, so before that, all numbers up to n=2025 are in rings 0 to 22.

The last number of ring k=22 is (2*22 +1)^2 = (44+1)^2=45^2=2025.

So n=2025 is the last number of ring k=22.

Now, where is n=2025 located? Since it's the end of ring k=22, and we know the end position.

From the movement, for each ring, it ends after the east move.

In the sequence, it moves east last, and ends at the last cell of east move.

For ring k, after moving east, it ends at a certain position.

From earlier examples:

For k=1: ended at (1,-1) after east move.

For k=2: ended at (2,-2) after east move.

Now, what is the coordinate? For k=1: (1,-1) = (k, -k)

k=2: (2,-2) = (k, -k)

So probably for ring k, it ends at (k, -k)

Now for k=22, ends at (22, -22)

Now n=2025 is at (22,-22)

Now our n=2026 is at (23,-22)

So they are adjacent: (22,-22) and (23,-22), so right next to each other horizontally.

Now, we need the neighbors of (23,-22)

List them:

1. North: (23,-21)

2. South: (23,-23)

3. West: (22,-22)

4. East: (24,-22)

5. Northwest: (22,-21)

6. Northeast: (24,-21)

7. Southwest: (22,-23)

8. Southeast: (24,-23)

Now, we need to find which numbers are in these cells.

First, note that n=2025 is at (22,-22), which is the west neighbor.

Now, other neighbors: since the spiral is filled up to n=2025, all cells with numbers are in rings up to k=22.

Now, the position (23,-22) is on the boundary of ring k=23, but since it's the start, and ring k=23 starts here, so cells with |x|>22 or |y|>22 might be outside, but specifically, for ring k=22, the grid is from -22 to 22 inclusive, since min and max coordinate is k for ring k.

For ring k, the coordinates range from -k to k inclusive.

So for k=22, all cells with |x| <=22, |y| <=22 are filled, but only those that are in the spiral, but actually, the entire grid up to |x|<=22, |y|<=22 is filled, because each ring fills the boundary, and inner is filled by previous rings.

Is that true? For example, in k=1, cells from -1 to 1, all are filled: center and boundary.

Similarly for k=2, from -2 to 2, all filled.

Yes, since the rings fill the entire grid progressively. Specifically, after ring k, all cells with max(|x|,|y|) <= k are filled.

For example, after ring k=1, max(|x|,|y|) <=1 are filled.

After ring k=2, max(|x|,|y|) <=2 filled, and so on.

So up to n=2025, which is end of ring k=22, all cells with max(|x|,|y|) <=22 are filled.

Now, our point (23,-22) has max(|23|,| -22|)=23>22, so it is not filled yet, but n=2026 is there, but for neighbors, we need cells adjacent.

Now, the neighbors:

- (23,-21): max(|23|,| -21|)=23>22, so not filled yet. Since max coord 23>22, so this cell is outside the filled region, so no number assigned yet. But in the spiral, numbers are assigned sequentially, and since n=2026 is just starting, the next numbers will be assigned to adjacent cells, but for now, at this moment, only cells with max(|x|,|y|) <=22 have numbers, and this neighbor has max=23>22, so it has no number yet. But the problem is to find the sum of neighbors, but if a neighbor has no number, what do we do? But the grid is infinite, and all cells will have numbers eventually, but for the neighbors of 2026, when we consider the eight adjacent cells, some may not have numbers assigned yet, but in the context, probably we need to find which cells have numbers at that point, but since the spiral is filled sequentially, when we place 2026, the neighbors that are already filled will have numbers, but those not filled yet will be filled later, but for the neighbor sum, we probably only consider cells that have numbers assigned at that time, meaning only cells that are filled before 2026.

Since n=2026 is placed at (23,-22), and before that, all n<2026 are placed, so any neighbor cell that has max(|x|,|y|) <=22 will have a number, since the grid up to max coord 22 is completely filled.

Cells with max(|x|,|y|) >22 have no number yet.

So for each neighbor, if max(|x|,|y|) <=22, then it has a number; else, not.

Now, list the neighbors and their max coord:

1. (23,-21): max(23,21)=23 >22 → no number

2. (23,-23): max(23,23)=23>22 → no number

3. (22,-22): max(22,22)=22 <=22 → has number

4. (24,-22): max(24,22)=24>22 → no number

5. (22,-21): max(22,21)=22<=22 → has number

6. (24,-21): max(24,21)=24>22 → no number

7. (22,-23): max(22,23)=23>22 → no number

8. (24,-23): max(24,23)=24>22 → no number

So only two neighbors have numbers: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

(22,-22) is west, and (22,-21) is northwest? From (23,-22), west is (22,-22), northwest is (22,-21)? Let's see: northwest would be x-1,y+1? If x increases right, y increases up.

Assuming standard: x right, y up.

So from (23,-22), northwest: decrease x, increase y: (22,-21)

Yes.

And west: (22,-22)

Now, we know that (22,-22) has n=2025, as we said earlier, since it's the end of ring k=22.

Now, what about (22,-21)? This cell is within max coord 22, so it has a number, but what is it?

Since it's filled before n=2025, and we need to find which number is there.

So we need to find the number at position (22,-21) in the spiral.

Since we know the ring and the movement, we can compute it.

The cell (22,-21) is in ring k=22, since max(|22|,| -21|)=22, so in ring 22.

Ring k=22 has numbers from (2*22-1)^2 +1 = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850 to (2*22+1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.

Now, we need to find where in the ring this cell is.

The ring starts at (k, 1-k) = (22, 1-22) = (22, -21)

k=22, start at (22, -21)

But our cell is (22,-21), exactly the start point.

Now, what number is at the start? The first number of the ring.

For ring k, the first number is at the start position, which is (k, 1-k)

And the number is (2k-1)^2 +1

For k=22, (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1 =43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

Is that correct? Earlier for k=1, start at (1,0) with n=2, and (2*1-1)^2 +1=1^2+1=2, yes.

For k=2, start at (2,-1) with n=10, (2*2-1)^2 +1=3^2+1=10, yes.

So for k=22, start at (22,-21) with n=1850.

But our cell is (22,-21), so it has n=1850.

But is that possible? n=1850 at (22,-21), and n=2025 at (22,-22), and n=2026 at (23,-22).

Now, the neighbors we have: (22,-22) with n=2025, and (22,-21) with n=1850.

But are there others? Earlier we listed only these two have max coord <=22.

But let me confirm: (22,-22) max(22,22)=22<=22

(22,-21) max(22,21)=22<=22

Others: (23,-21) max(23,21)=23>22

(23,-23) max(23,23)=23>22

(24,-22) max(24,22)=24>22

(24,-21) max(24,21)=24>22

(22,-23) max(22,23)=23>22

(24,-23) max(24,23)=24>22

Yes, only two neighbors have numbers: (22,-22) with 2025, and (22,-21) with 1850.

So the sum should be 2025 + 1850.

But is that all? Eight neighbors, but only two are occupied at the time? But the problem asks for the sum of all eight neighbors, but if some are not yet filled, do we include them? Probably not, since they don't have numbers yet. But in the context, when we say "neighbors", it might imply the adjacent cells, and we need their numbers when assigned, but since they are assigned later, perhaps we should only consider the cells that are already filled.

But in the problem, for example, take a small number, say neighbors of 1.

From the grid: 1 at (0,0)

Neighbors: north (0,1):4? In grid, above is 6? Earlier grid: positions:

(0,0):1

(-1,0):6, (1,0):2

(0,1):4? Above: y=1, x=0: in grid, above 1 is 4? Earlier: for y=1, x=0:4, yes.

In the initial snippet: row above: 5,4,3 so at (0,1):4

Then (0,-1):8? Below: in grid, below 1 is 8? "...7 8 9..." so at (0,-1):8

Then diagonals: northwest (-1,1):5, northeast (1,1):3, southwest (-1,-1):7, southeast (1,-1):9

So neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? All eight: left:6, right:2, up:4, down:8, nw:5, ne:3, sw:7, se:9.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

Now, if we consider only filled neighbors, but at n=1, only itself is filled, neighbors are not filled yet? But in the spiral, when we place 1, the neighbors are empty, but later filled. But the problem probably considers the grid as it is when the number is placed, but for neighbors, it should include the cells that will have numbers, but at the time, they are empty. However, in this case, for 1, all neighbors are filled later, but we include them in the sum. But when we compute the sum for neighbors of 1, we sum the numbers that are in those cells, which are 2 through 9, even though they were placed after 1.

Similarly, for any number, the neighbors' values are fixed once the spiral is complete, so we should consider the numbers that eventually occupy those cells, regardless of when they are placed.

In other words, for each adjacent cell, there is a number assigned to it in the spiral, and we sum those numbers for the eight adjacent cells.

For n=2026 at (23,-22), the eight adjacent cells are as listed, and each has a number assigned in the spiral, even if placed later.

So we need to find the numbers at those eight positions.

Earlier I assumed that cells with max coord >22 are not filled yet, but they will be filled later in ring k=23 or higher.

Specifically, for neighbor (23,-21), max(23,21)=23>22, so it is in ring k=23 or higher.

Similarly for others.

So we need to find which ring each neighbor is in and what number is there.

So let's list the eight neighbors and their coordinates:

A: north: (23, -21)  // x=23,y=-21

B: south: (23, -23)  // x=23,y=-23

C: west: (22, -22)  // x=22,y=-22

D: east: (24, -22)  // x=24,y=-22

E: northwest: (22, -21)  // x=22,y=-21

F: northeast: (24, -21)  // x=24,y=-21

G: southwest: (22, -23)  // x=22,y=-23

H: southeast: (24, -23)  // x=24,y=-23

Now, for each, compute max(|x|,|y|) to find which ring it belongs to.

Ring k is determined by max(|x|,|y|) = k, since for a cell, the ring k is such that max(|x|,|y|) = k.

Because the ring k consists of all cells with max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, (2,-1): max(2,1)=2, in ring k=2.

(1,-1): max(1,1)=1, ring k=1.

(0,0): max(0,0)=0, but ring k=0? Earlier we said ring k=0 for center, but max coord is 0.

In our earlier definition, for ring k, k starts from 0: k=0: max coord 0, only (0,0), n=1.

k=1: max coord 1, numbers 2 to 9.

k=2: max coord 2, numbers 10 to 25.

So yes, each cell with max(|x|,|y|) = k is in ring k.

The number in ring k ranges from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

Now for each neighbor:

First, C: west: (22,-22): max(|22|,| -22|)=22, so ring k=22.

Similarly, E: northwest: (22,-21): max(|22|,| -21|)=22, ring k=22.

Now, A: north: (23,-21): max(|23|,| -21|)=23, ring k=23.

B: south: (23,-23): max(|23|,| -23|)=23, ring k=23.

D: east: (24,-22): max(|24|,| -22|)=24, ring k=24.

F: northeast: (24,-21): max(|24|,| -21|)=24, ring k=24.

G: southwest: (22,-23): max(|22|,| -23|)=23, ring k=23.

H: southeast: (24,-23): max(|24|,| -23|)=24, ring k=24.

So we have:

- Ring 22: C and E

- Ring 23: A, B, G

- Ring 24: D, F, H

Now, we need the numbers at these positions.

First, for ring 22: cells C: (22,-22) and E: (22,-21)

We already know that (22,-22) is the end of ring 22, so it has the last number: (2*22 +1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025.

Now, (22,-21): as we said earlier, it is the start of ring 22? Start of ring k is at (k,1-k)

For k=22, start at (22,1-22)=(22,-21), yes, exactly E.

And first number is (2k-1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

So E has 1850.

Now, for ring 23: cells A: (23,-21), B: (23,-23), G: (22,-23)

Ring k=23, numbers from (2*23-1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026 to (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

Now, we need to find which cells have which numbers.

The ring starts at (k,1-k)=(23,1-23)=(23,-22)

But that's our central cell, which has n=2026.

Now, from there, it moves north with 2k-1=46-1=45 steps.

So from (23,-22), move north: increase y by 1 each step.

So first move to (23,-21): that's neighbor A.

Since it moves north 45 steps, and each step adds a new number.

The sequence: start at (23,-22): n=2026.

Then move north: first step to (23,-21): n=2027? 

In the movement, when we say "move direction s steps", it means we move s times, each time to a new cell, and assign consecutive numbers.

For example, in k=1: start at (1,0):2, then move north to (1,1):3.

So the first cell in the move gets the next number.

Similarly, here: start at (23,-22):2026.

Then move north: to (23,-21):2027, then (23,-20):2028, ..., up to (23,-22 + 45) = (23,23)? Since y increases.

Start y=-22, move north: each step y increases by 1.

After first step: y=-21, cell (23,-21): n=2027

After second step: (23,-20):2028

...

After 45th step: y= -22 + 45 = 23, so (23,23): n=2026 + 45 = 2071? Since each step adds one number.

Start at n=2026.

After first move north, to (23,-21): n=2027

After second: (23,-20):2028

...

After m-th step: n=2026 + m

After 45 steps: m=45, n=2026+45=2071, at (23,23)

But is that correct? Total cells in north move: since we move 45 steps, we add 45 cells: from (23,-21) to (23,23), but y from -21 to 23 inclusive? y=-21,-20,...,23.

Number of cells: from y=-21 to y=23, that's 23 - (-21) +1 = 23+21+1=45 cells, yes.

But the start cell is separate? In our earlier small example, for k=2: start at (2,-1):10, then move north to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13, so three cells:11,12,13, which is n=11,12,13 for three cells.

Start was 10, then first move north adds three cells:11,12,13.

So the numbers added in the move are consecutive starting from start number plus one.

In general, after starting at n_start, the first move adds s cells with numbers n_start+1 to n_start+s.

Here for ring k=23, start n=2026, north move s=45 steps, so adds 45 cells: n=2027 to 2026+45=2071.

At positions: from (23,-21) to (23,23), inclusive.

Specifically, neighbor A is (23,-21), which is the first cell in the north move, so n=2027.

Now, next neighbors: B: (23,-23) and G: (22,-23)

B is south: (23,-23), which is below.

G is southwest: (22,-23)

In the spiral, after north move, it moves west, then south, then east.

But we need these positions.

Currently, after north move, we are at (23,23)

Then next move is west, with step size 2k=46 steps? Earlier for ring k, west move has 2k steps.

k=23, west: 2*23=46 steps.

Move west: decrease x.

From (23,23), move west to (22,23), (21,23), ..., down to x= -23? Since step size 46.

x starts at 23, decrease by 1 each step.

After 46 steps: x=23-46= -23, so to (-23,23)

Numbers: after north move, last number was 2071 at (23,23)

Then move west: first step to (22,23): n=2072

Then (21,23):2073, ..., to (-23,23): n=2071 + 46 = 2117? Since 46 steps, adds 46 cells: n=2072 to 2071+46=2117.

Now, our neighbors: B is (23,-23), which is not on this path; it's at x=23, y=-23.

Similarly, G is (22,-23)

So probably not in west move.

After west, it moves south, with 2k=46 steps.

From (-23,23), move south: decrease y.

To (-23,22), (-23,21), ..., down to y= -23? After 46 steps: y=23-46= -23, so to (-23,-23)

Numbers: last was 2117 at (-23,23), then move south: first to (-23,22):2118, ..., to (-23,-23): n=2117 + 46 = 2163.

Still not our points.

Then finally move east, with 2k=46 steps.

From (-23,-23), move east: increase x.

To (-22,-23), (-21,-23), ..., to (23,-23)? After 46 steps: x= -23 +46=23, so to (23,-23)

Numbers: last was 2163 at (-23,-23), then move east: first to (-22,-23):2164, ..., to (23,-23): n=2163 + 46 = 2209? But last number should be (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209, yes.

Now, at (23,-23), which is neighbor B, and it has n=2209.

Now, what about G: (22,-23)

In the east move, from (-23,-23) to (23,-23), all at y=-23.

So positions: x from -23 to 23, y=-23.

Specifically, (22,-23) is one of them.

Since it moves east from x=-23 to x=23, step by step.

Start at (-23,-23): n=2163? After south move, ends at (-23,-23): n=2163? Earlier: south move ends at (-23,-23): n=2163? But south move: started at (-23,23): n=2117? Then move south: to (-23,22):2118, (-23,21):2119, ..., down to (-23,-23).

y from 23 to -23, step -1, number of steps: from y=22 down to y=-23? When moving south, from (-23,23), first step to (-23,22): n=2118? Since last of west was at (-23,23): n=2117, then first south move to (-23,22):2118.

Then to (-23,21):2119, ..., to (-23,-23): y decreases from 23 to -23, change of -46, so 46 steps? y starts at 23, after first step y=22, after second y=21, ..., after m steps y=23 - m.

Set y= -23: 23 - m = -23 ⇒ m=46.

So after 46 steps, y=23-46= -23, so (-23,-23): n=2117 + 46 = 2163? Since each step adds one number, n increases by 1 per step, so from start of south move: n=2118 at (-23,22), ..., n=2117 + 46 = 2163 at (-23,-23)? Start of south move: first cell is (-23,22): n=2118? But the last of previous move (west) ended at (-23,23): n=2117, so the next number is 2118 at (-23,22)? But position: from (-23,23) move south to (-23,22), yes.

So n=2118 at (-23,22)

n=2119 at (-23,21)

...

n=2117 + k at y=23 - k? When y=23, n=2117? But y=23 is the start, but we move to y=22.

Set: at y=23: n=2117 (end of west)

Then at y=22: n=2118

y=21:2119

...

y=j: n=2117 + (23 - j) ? When j=23, n=2117 +0=2117

j=22, n=2117+1=2118

j=21,2117+2=2119

...

j= -23: 23 - (-23)=46, so n=2117 + 46 = 2163, yes.

Now, after south move, at (-23,-23): n=2163

Then move east: increase x, y fixed at -23.

To (-22,-23): n=2164? Next number.

Then (-21,-23):2165, ..., up to (23,-23): x=23, n=2163 + (23 - (-23)) ? From x=-23 to x=23, step by step.

Start at x=-23: n=2163

First step to x=-22: n=2164

x=-21:2165

...

x=m: n=2163 + (m - (-23)) = 2163 + m +23

When m=23, n=2163 +23+23=2163+46=2209, yes.

So positions: (x, -23) for x from -23 to 23, n=2163 + (x - (-23)) = 2163 + x +23 = x + 2186? 2163 +23=2186, so n = x + 2186

Since x from -23 to 23, n from -23+2186=2163 to 23+2186=2209, yes.

Now, neighbor B is (23,-23), so n=23 + 2186 = 2209

Neighbor G is (22,-23), so n=22 + 2186 = 2208

Now, we also have neighbor A: (23,-21), which we already have from north move: n=2027

Earlier for A: (23,-21), in north move, first cell, n=2027

Now, we need D, F, H in ring 24.

But first, summarize what we have so far.

Neighbors:

C: west: (22,-22): ring 22, n=2025

E: northwest: (22,-21): ring 22, n=1850

A: north: (23,-21): ring 23, n=2027

B: south: (23,-23): ring 23, n=2209

G: southwest: (22,-23): ring 23, n=2208

Now, missing D: east (24,-22), F: northeast (24,-21), H: southeast (24,-23), all in ring 24.

Ring k=24, numbers from (2*24-1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210 to (2*24+1)^2=49^2=2401.

Now, we need positions: D:(24,-22), F:(24,-21), H:(24,-23)

The ring starts at (k,1-k)=(24,1-24)=(24,-23)

So start at (24,-23) with n=2210? First number is (2k-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Now, moves: north first, with 2k-1=48-1=47 steps.

From (24,-23), move north to (24,-22), (24,-21), ..., up to (24,24)? After 47 steps.

Start: (24,-23): n=2210

Move north: to (24,-22): n=2211

(24,-21):2212

...

To (24,24): n=2210 + 47 = 2257? Since 47 steps, adds 47 cells: n=2211 to 2257.

Now, neighbor H: southeast: (24,-23) — that's the start position, so n=2210

Neighbor D: east: (24,-22) — that's the first north move: (24,-22): n=2211

Neighbor F: northeast: (24,-21) — that's the second north move: (24,-21): n=2212

Now, we have all eight neighbors' numbers.

List them:

- West (C): (22,-22): 2025

- Northwest (E): (22,-21): 1850

- North (A): (23,-21): 2027

- Northeast (F): (24,-21): 2212

- East (D): (24,-22): 2211

- Southeast (H): (24,-23): 2210

- South (B): (23,-23): 2209

- Southwest (G): (22,-23): 2208

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers: 2025, 1850, 2027, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2209, 2208

Now, sum.

Notice that some are consecutive or close.

Group them.

First, the ring 22 neighbors: 2025 and 1850.

1850 is small, others larger.

We can sum all.

Note that 2025 and 2027 are close.

List:

1850

2025, 2027

2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Sum: first, 1850.

Then 2025 + 2027 = 4052

Then the last five: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212

These are consecutive integers from 2208 to 2212.

Sum = (number of terms) * (first + last)/2 = 5 * (2208 + 2212)/2 = 5 * (4420)/2 = 5 * 2210 = 11050

Now, total sum: 1850 + 4052 + 11050

First, 1850 + 4052 = 5902

Then 5902 + 11050 = 16952

Is that right? 5900 + 11050 = 16950, plus 2 is 16952.

But let me verify with smaller numbers.

For example, earlier for n=1, neighbors sum to 44.

Now, according to this, for n=2026, sum is 16952.

But let me double-check the numbers.

First, C: (22,-22): end of ring 22: (45)^2=2025, correct.

E: (22,-21): start of ring 22: 43^2 +1=1849+1=1850, correct.

A: (23,-21): first north move of ring 23: start is 2026 at (23,-22), so next is (23,-21):2027, correct.

B: (23,-23): end of ring 23: 47^2=2209, correct.

G: (22,-23): in east move of ring 23, at (22,-23), n= x + 2186, with x=22, so 22+2186=2208, correct.

D: (24,-22): in ring 24, north move: at (24,-22), which is the second cell? Start at (24,-23):2210, then north to (24,-22):2211, yes.

F: (24,-21): next, (24,-21):2212, yes.

H: (24,-23): start of ring 24:2210, yes.

Now sum: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2209, 2208.

Write in order: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Sum: add sequentially.

1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

Then 5902 + 2208 = 8110

8110 + 2209 = 10319

10319 + 2210 = 12529

12529 + 2211 = 14740

14740 + 2212 = 16952

Same as before.

Notice that 2208 to 2212 sum to 5 * 2210 = 11050, as before.

Then 1850 + 2025 + 2027 = 1850 + 4052 = 5902

Total 5902 + 11050 = 16952.

Is this the sum? But the problem asks for the sum of all eight neighbors, and we have eight numbers, sum 16952.

But let me confirm if all neighbors are covered and correct.

In the spiral, are there any other neighbors? We have all eight adjacent cells.

But for example, is (23,-22) adjacent to (22,-22)? Yes, west.

To (22,-21)? Northwest, yes.

To (23,-21)? North, yes.

To (24,-21)? Northeast, yes.

To (24,-22)? East, yes.

To (24,-23)? Southeast, yes.

To (23,-23)? South, yes.

To (22,-23)? Southwest, yes.

All covered.

Now, the numbers seem correct based on the spiral movement.

But just to be sure, for a smaller n, say neighbors of n=2.

n=2 is at (1,0)

Neighbors: eight adjacent.

(1,1):3? North

(1,-1):9? South? But in spiral, (1,-1) is 9.

(0,0):1? West

(2,0):10? East? But n=10 is later.

(0,1):4? Northwest

(2,1):12? Northeast? n=12

(0,-1):8? Southwest? n=8

(2,-1):10? Southeast? n=10

But (2,0) is east, should be adjacent.

Now, numbers: 1,3,4,8,9,10,12? And (2,0):10? But (2,-1):10? Positions.

(1,0):2

West: (0,0):1

Northwest: (0,1):4

North: (1,1):3

Northeast: (2,1):12? In earlier, for k=2, (2,1):12

East: (2,0):10? In k=2, (2,0):11? Earlier: start (2,-1):10, north to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, so (2,0):11

Southeast: (2,-1):10? (2,-1) is southeast? From (1,0), southeast is (2,-1)? x+1,y-1, yes.

South: (1,-1):9? In k=1, (1,-1):9

Southwest: (0,-1):8? (0,-1):8

So neighbors: (0,0):1, (0,1):4, (1,1):3, (2,1):12, (2,0):11, (2,-1):10, (1,-1):9, (0,-1):8

Sum:1+4+3+12+11+10+9+8

Calculate: 1+4=5, +3=8, +12=20, +11=31, +10=41, +9=50, +8=58.

Now, according to our method, for n=2, which is first of ring k=1? Ring k=1 starts at (1,0) with n=2.

Position (1,0)

Neighbors:

West: (0,0): max(0,0)=0, ring k=0, only (0,0):1

Northwest: (0,1): max(0,1)=1, ring k=1

North: (1,1): max(1,1)=1, ring k=1

Northeast: (2,1): max(2,1)=2, ring k=2

East: (2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring k=2

Southeast: (2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ring k=2? |y|=1, max=2

South: (1,-1): max(1,1)=1, ring k=1

Southwest: (0,-1): max(0,1)=1, ring k=1

Now, numbers:

West: (0,0): ring 0, n=1

Northwest: (0,1): ring 1, position: for k=1, cells: (0,1) is in west move? Earlier: after start (1,0):2, move north to (1,1):3, then west to (0,1):4, (-1,1):5. So (0,1):4

Similarly, north: (1,1):3

South: (1,-1):9? After south and east: south to (-1,-1):7, east to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9. So (1,-1):9

Southwest: (0,-1):8

Now ring 2: northeast: (2,1): ring 2, start (2,-1):10, move north to (2,0):11, (2,1):12. So (2,1):12

East: (2,0):11

Southeast: (2,-1):10

So same as above: 1,4,3,12,11,10,9,8 sum 58, as before.

Now for n=2026, we have similar.

So back to sum: 16952.

But is this correct? In our list, we have numbers from 1850 to 2212, sum 16952 seems reasonable.

Note that the neighbors include cells from different rings.

We can compute the sum directly.

But anyway, I think it's correct.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the sum again.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Add in pairs:

1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062, 4236, 4237, 4417

4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952

Same.

Note that 2208 to 2212 sum to 5 * 2210 = 11050

Then 1850 + 2025 + 2027 = 1850 + 4052 = 5902

5902 + 11050 = 16952.

So I think it's correct.

Therefore, the sum is 16952.

But the problem is for n=2026, and we got 16952, which is less than 2026*8=16208? 2026*8=16208, but our sum is larger, 16952>16208, but since neighbors include larger numbers, it makes sense.

Average neighbor is about 16952/8=2119, while 2026 is smaller, but since it's on the edge, neighbors can be larger or smaller, but in this case, most are larger.

Anyway, calculation seems consistent.

So the answer should be 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center 1 is at (0, 0), the positive x-direction is east, and the positive y-direction is north.

The eight neighboring positions and their corresponding numbers are:

- West (22, -22): 2025 (end of ring 22)
- Northwest (22, -21): 1850 (start of ring 22)
- North (23, -21): 2027 (first cell in the north move of ring 23)
- Northeast (24, -21): 2212 (second cell in the north move of ring 24)
- East (24, -22): 2211 (first cell in the north move of ring 24)
- Southeast (24, -23): 2210 (start of ring 24)
- South (23, -23): 2209 (end of ring 23)
- Southwest (22, -23): 2208 (in the east move of ring 23)

The sum of these numbers is calculated as follows:

- Sum of 1850, 2025, and 2027:  
  \(1850 + 2025 = 3875\), \(3875 + 2027 = 5902\)

- Sum of 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, and 2212 (consecutive integers):  
  Number of terms: 5, first term: 2208, last term: 2212  
  Sum = \(\frac{5 \times (2208 + 2212)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4420}{2} = 5 \times 2210 = 11050\)

- Total sum: \(5902 + 11050 = 16952\)

Thus, the sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
