<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows a snippet:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand how the spiral is constructed. It starts with 1 at the center, then moves right to 2, down to 3? Looking at the grid:

Positioning: assuming (0,0) is the center where 1 is.

So, 1 is at (0,0).

Then 2 is to the right, so (1,0).

In the grid, it's shown as:

Row 1: ... 5 4 3 ... probably above.

Looking at the grid:

It says:

... 5 4 3 ...  // this might be y=1 or something.

Set coordinates. Let’s say the center 1 is at (0,0).

Then to the right is 2, so (1,0).

Then down? The next number after 2 should be 3, but in the grid, above 1 is 3? No.

The grid shows:

First row: 5,4,3 — so probably y=1, x=-1? Let's see.

Standard Ulam spiral or something similar.

After 1, it goes right to 2, then up? But in the grid, above 1 is 3? Confusing.

Look at the sequence: starting from center 1.

Then moving right to 2.

Then, since it's a spiral, it should turn up or down. Typically, it turns down or up depending on direction.

In this representation:

The grid shows:

Row with 5,4,3 — so let's say this is row y=1.

But 3 is at (1,1)? Let's list the positions.

Assume that the spiral starts at center, moves right, then down, then left, then up, and so on.

So, 1 at (0,0).

Move right to (1,0) for 2.

Then move down to (1,-1) for 3? But in the grid, it shows 3 above 1? Perhaps y increases up or down.

In the grid, it shows:

... 5 4 3 ...  // top row

... 6 1 2 ...  // middle row

... 7 8 9 ...  // bottom row

So, relative to center (0,0):

- At (0,0): 1

- At (1,0): 2  // right

- At (0,1): ? not shown, but above 1 is nothing? Wait.

In the middle row: 6,1,2 — so x from left to right: 6 at left, 1 at center, 2 at right.

So if center is (0,0), then:

- (0,0): 1

- (1,0): 2  // positive x right

- (-1,0): 6  // left

Then top row: 5,4,3 — so above, probably y=1.

So at ( -1,1): 5? Let's see.

Assume y increases upwards, x increases to the right.

So:

Top row (y=1): x= -1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But 3 is at (1,1), but earlier I thought 2 is at (1,0), so after 2 should be 3 at (1,-1) or something.

Inconsistency.

After 1,2, then typically it goes down to 3, left to 4,5, etc.

But here, the bottom row has 7,8,9, so 7 at left, 8 center, 9 right, so y=-1.

So:

y=1: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? But 3 is at (1,1), but 2 is at (1,0), so 3 should be adjacent, but (1,1) is diagonal? No, adjacent would be (1,1) or (1,-1) or (0,1), etc.

From (1,0) to (1,1) is up, which is adjacent, but in spiral order, after 2 at (1,0), it might go down to (1,-1) for 3.

But in the grid, at (1,1) is 3, and at (1,-1) is 8 or something.

Let's list the numbers and their positions based on the grid.

Given:

Row y=1: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3? The dots indicate it's not complete, but probably for x=-1,0,1.

Similarly, y=0: x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2

y=-1: x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9

But 3 is at (1,1), 4 at (0,1), 5 at (-1,1), 6 at (-1,0), 7 at (-1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1).

Now, the sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...

At (0,0):1

(1,0):2

Then next should be 3. From (1,0), if it goes up to (1,1):3, then left to (0,1):4, then left to (-1,1):5, then down to (-1,0):6, then down to (-1,-1):7, then right to (0,-1):8, then right to (1,-1):9.

That makes sense. So the spiral goes: start at center, move right, then up, then left, then down, and so on. But typically it's right, down, left, up, but here it's right, up, left, down.

Confirming: from 1(0,0) to 2(1,0) right.

Then to 3(1,1) up.

Then to 4(0,1) left.

Then to 5(-1,1) left.

Then to 6(-1,0) down.

Then to 7(-1,-1) down.

Then to 8(0,-1) right.

Then to 9(1,-1) right.

Then next would be down? To (1,-2):10? But not shown.

After 9 at (1,-1), it should continue the spiral. Since it just came right, and before that it was down, so it might turn left or something. But anyway, for now, we have the direction.

So the movement is: after starting, it moves in directions: right, up, left, down, and repeats.

Sequence of moves: first move right 1 step (to 2), then up 1 step (to 3), then left 2 steps (to 4 and 5), then down 2 steps (to 6 and 7), then right 3 steps (to 8,9, and next would be 10 at (2,-1)? Let's see.

After 7 at (-1,-1), move right: to (0,-1):8, then (1,-1):9, then since moving right, and step size increases, probably next is to (2,-1):10, but after two steps? Step sizes: first move (right) length 1, then up length 1, then left length 2, down length 2, then right length 3? But after down to 7, it moved right to 8 and 9, that's two steps, but for right it should be length 3? 8 and 9 are two numbers, but length 2? From (-1,-1) to (0,-1) is one step to 8, then to (1,-1) is second step to 9. Then next should be to (2,-1):10? But in spiral, after that it should go up.

General rule: the spiral moves in cycles. Each "layer" or "ring" has a certain size.

Define the ring number. Let ring 0 be just the center 1.

Ring 1 is numbers 2 to 9, but 1 is alone, then 2 to 9 is the first ring.

Set k starting from 0.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -k+1) or something. Standard way.

Notice that the numbers on the axes or diagonals might be squares.

For example, at (n,n), what number?

From above: at (1,1):3, (2,2)? not given, but let's compute.

The spiral direction sequence: it moves in directions: right, up, left, down, and repeats, with step lengths increasing every two moves? Step lengths: first move (right): length 1 (to 2), then up: length 1 (to 3), then left: length 2 (to 4,5), then down: length 2 (to 6,7), then right: length 3 (to 8,9,10? 8 and 9 are two, but should be three? After down to 7, it moves right to 8,9, then to 10 at (2,-1), then since length 3, next is up? But up from (2,-1) to (2,0):11? Then (2,1):12? Then left to (1,1):13? But (1,1) is already occupied by 3. Conflict.

After 9 at (1,-1), next should be down? Or up? Let's think the path.

From start: (0,0) -> right to (1,0) -> up to (1,1) -> left to (0,1) -> left to (-1,1) -> down to (-1,0) -> down to (-1,-1) -> right to (0,-1) -> right to (1,-1).

Now at (1,-1), it has moved right twice (from (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1)), but the direction before was down (to (-1,-1)), so after down, it turned right, and moved two steps? But typically, after completing a direction, it turns left or right.

The step lengths are increasing. After the initial right and up (both length 1), then left and down (both length 2), then next should be right and up with length 3? But after down to (-1,-1), it moved right to (0,-1) and (1,-1), which is two steps, but for length 3, it should move three steps right, so to (2,-1):10.

Then after that, it should turn up, and move up length 3? So from (1,-1) to (1,0)? But (1,0) is already occupied by 2, so no.

From (1,-1), after moving right to here, the next direction should be up, since it's a spiral and it turns left or right. In this case, it seems to turn left: from right to up.

So from (1,-1), move up to (1,0), but (1,0) is occupied, so it must move to (1,1)? But occupied, or to (1,2)? Let's calculate the number.

After 9 at (1,-1), next number 10 should be at (2,-1)? Then 11 at (2,0)? 12 at (2,1)? 13 at (1,1)? but (1,1) is 3, occupied.

Mistake. The step after down should be right with length 3, but from where? After moving down to (-1,-1), the next move is right. But to go right, from (-1,-1), it moves to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9, and then it should continue to (2,-1):10, because length 3. Then after that, it turns up, so from (2,-1) move up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13, then turn left, move left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, then turn down, move down to (-1,1): but (-1,1) is occupied by 5, so must be to (-1,0)? occupied, no.

From (2,2) move left to (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, then down to (-1,1): but (-1,1) is 5, occupied, so it should be to (-1,0)? occupied by 6, or (-1,-1)? occupied by 7. Conflict.

I see the problem. When it moves left from (2,2) to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), that's three steps, to (-1,2), then down, but down to (-1,1), which is not occupied yet? In our earlier assignment, at (-1,1) is 5, but 5 is already there, and 16 is new, so it should be empty. In the initial grid, only up to 9 is shown, so (-1,2) is empty, so it can go to (-1,2):16, then down to (-1,1): but (-1,1) is already 5? No, in the initial positions, we have at (-1,1):5, which is number 5, but when we go to 16, it should be at new position. But (-1,1) is already occupied by 5, so it can't go there. So my assumption is wrong.

Perhaps the step lengths are not increasing that way. Let's list the positions for n from 1 to say 25.

Start at (0,0):1

Move right 1 step: to (1,0):2

Move up 1 step: to (1,1):3

Move left 2 steps: to (0,1):4, then to (-1,1):5

Move down 2 steps: to (-1,0):6, then to (-1,-1):7

Move right 2 steps? Earlier I said 3, but it was 2 for right? After down to (-1,-1), move right to (0,-1):8, then to (1,-1):9

Now at (1,-1), next move should be up, but how many steps? Previously, after down, it moved right, and it moved 2 steps, but for the next direction, it should be up, and since the last "arm" was down with 2 steps, and before that left with 2, up with 1, right with 1, so perhaps for the next ring, it increases.

After completing a full square, the step size increases.

From 1 to 2: right 1

2 to 3: up 1

3 to 5: left 2 (3 to 4,4 to 5)

5 to 7: down 2 (5 to 6,6 to 7)

7 to 9: right 2 (7 to 8,8 to9)

Now at 9 at (1,-1), next should be up, and since it's a new "layer", and previously it was 2 steps for left, down, right, but up was only 1, so perhaps for up, it should be 2 or 3? Let's see the pattern.

After 9, it should go up to (1,0), but occupied, so must go to (1,2)? Or to (1,0) is occupied, but in spiral, it doesn't go to occupied cells, so it must turn.

From (1,-1), since it came from right, and the cell above is (1,0) which is occupied, but in standard spiral, it turns left when it can't go straight, but here it can go up, but (1,0) is occupied, so it should turn left, but left would be west, to (0,-1), but occupied by 8, or north-west, but it should move in cardinal directions.

Perhaps after 9 at (1,-1), it moves up to (1,0), but since (1,0) is occupied, it must be that the next move is not up, but something else.

I recall that in some spirals, the step size increases after two turns, but let's calculate the number at (1,0) is 2, which is small, so for larger n, it's different.

Perhaps the direction changes after each "arm", and the length of each arm increases every two arms.

Let me try to find a general formula for the position of number n.

I know that the spiral is symmetric, and the ring number can be determined.

Let k be the ring number, where ring k has numbers from (2k-1)^2 +1 to (2k+1)^2.

For k=0: ring 0: 1 to 1? (2*0-1)^2 =1, but 1 is at center.

Usually, the center is ring 0: number 1.

Then ring 1: from 2 to 9, which is 8 numbers, and (2*1+1)^2 =9, (2*1-1)^2=1, so from 1+1=2 to 9.

Ring 2: from 10 to 25, since (5)^2=25, (3)^2=9, so 10 to 25.

Ring 3: from 26 to 49, (7)^2=49, (5)^2=25.

And so on.

The size of ring k is ((2k+1)^2 - (2k-1)^2) = (4k^2+4k+1 - (4k^2-4k+1)) = 8k.

So 8k numbers in ring k.

For a given n, find which ring it is in.

Find the smallest m such that (2m+1)^2 >= n.

Or find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

For n=1, k=0, (2*0-1)^2=1, 1<=1, but usually ring 0 is just 1.

For n>1, k is the smallest integer such that (2k+1)^2 >= n.

For n=2, (2*1+1)^2=9>=2, so k=1.

n=9, k=1.

n=10, (2*2+1)^2=25>=10, so k=2.

n=25, k=2.

n=26, k=3, since (7)^2=49>=26.

Now, for a given ring k, it starts at number s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1.

For k=1, s1 = (1)^2 +1=2, good.

k=2, s2=3^2 +1=10, good.

k=3, s3=5^2+1=26, good.

The ring has 8k numbers.

The starting point is at (k, 1-k) or something? Let's see for k=1.

Ring k=1: starts at 2.

Position: from earlier, 2 is at (1,0).

The ring is traversed in order: right, up, left, down? But in our case, it was right, up, left, down for the first ring, but with different lengths.

For ring k, the first move is right, then up, then left, then down.

The length of each move in ring k is 2k? For k=1, length should be 1 for each? But earlier we had right length 1, up length 1, left length 2, down length 2? Inconsistent.

For ring k, the moves have lengths: the first move (right) has length 2k-1? Let's see.

Standard Ulam spiral often has: from the start of the ring, move right for a certain length, then up, then left, then down.

For ring k, the start is at (k, k-1) or something.

For k=1, start at (1,0) for number 2.

Then move up? In our case, from (1,0) it moved up to (1,1):3.

But for a full ring, it should move in four directions.

For ring k, the length of each "side" is 2k.

For k=1, length 2, but we have only 8 numbers, each side should have 2k numbers? 2*1=2, but a square ring has 4 sides, each of length L, but total numbers are 4L, but for ring k, size 8k, so each side should have 2k numbers? Since 4 * 2k = 8k.

For k=1, each side has 2 numbers.

But in our earlier, for ring 1: from 2 to 9.

Side 1: right? But it's not a full side.

The ring starts at the bottom-right corner or something.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -k+1) or let's calculate.

For k=1, start at (1,0) for 2.

Then it moves up. But if each side has 2 numbers, moving up should go to (1,1) and then? But next is (1,1):3, then left to (0,1):4, then to (-1,1):5, so that's moving left for two steps.

Then down to (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, then right to (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9.

So the sides are: up: from (1,0) to (1,1) — only one step? But we have two numbers: 2 and 3? But 2 is at start, 3 is after move up.

Perhaps the moves include the starting point or not.

The first move is from the start position to the next.

From start (1,0) for 2, move up to (1,1) for 3 — so this move covers one step, one number added.

Then from there, move left to (0,1) for 4, then to (-1,1) for 5 — two steps.

Then move down to (-1,0) for 6, then to (-1,-1) for 7 — two steps.

Then move right to (0,-1) for 8, then to (1,-1) for 9 — two steps.

But the first move was only one step, while others are two. Inconsistent for k=1.

For k=1, the first move (up) has length 1, then left length 2, down length 2, right length 2.

But total 1+2+2+2=7, but ring has 8 numbers, missing one? 2 to 9 is 8 numbers, but the moves cover from 2 to 9, but the start is included, so the moves add 7 numbers? No.

The start number is already there, then each move adds a number for each step.

At start, number s is placed.

Then move in direction d1 for L1 steps, each step adds a number.

Then turn, move in d2 for L2 steps, and so on.

For ring k=1: start at (1,0) with number 2.

Then move up for 1 step: to (1,1), add number 3.

Then move left for 2 steps: to (0,1) add 4, to (-1,1) add 5.

Then move down for 2 steps: to (-1,0) add 6, to (-1,-1) add 7.

Then move right for 2 steps: to (0,-1) add 8, to (1,-1) add 9.

Total added: 1+2+2+2=7 numbers, plus start, total 8, good.

Now for k=2, ring from 10 to 25.

Start at? Should be at (2, -1) or something.

General pattern: for ring k, it starts at (k, 1-k) or let's see.

For k=1, (1,1-1)=(1,0), good.

Then moves: first move is up? In this case, it moved up.

But for k=2, start at (2,1-2)=(2,-1).

Then move up for how many steps? Lengths: for k=1, first move (up) length 1, then left length 2, down length 2, right length 2.

For k=2, should be first move up length 2? Or what.

Total numbers added: 8k -1? No, total numbers in ring are 8k, including start, so added during moves: 8k -1.

The sum of the lengths should be 8k -1.

The lengths for the four moves: typically, for ring k, the first move has length 2k-1, and the next three have length 2k.

For k=1: first move length 2*1-1=1, then next three: 2,2,2, sum 1+2+2+2=7, good.

For k=2: first move length 2*2-1=3, then next three each length 4? 2*2=4, sum 3+4+4+4=15, but 8*2=16 numbers, should add 15 numbers, plus start, total 16, good.

Now directions: for each ring, it starts at the bottom-right corner? For k=1, start at (1,0), which is right of center, same y, so east.

Then moves: up (north), then left (west), then down (south), then right (east).

But after moving right, it ends at (1,-1) for k=1, which is southeast of center.

For k=2, start at (2,-1)? According to formula (k,1-k)=(2,-1).

Then first move up: north, for 3 steps.

So from (2,-1) move up: to (2,0), add 11? Numbers: start at (2,-1) with number s2=10.

Then move up: to (2,0) add 11, (2,1) add 12, (2,2) add 13. Since length 3, three steps: to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).

Then next move left: west, length 4? For k=2, next three moves length 2k=4.

So move left: to (1,2) add 14, (0,2) add 15, (-1,2) add 16, (-2,2) add 17.

Then move down: south, length 4: to (-2,1) add 18, (-2,0) add 19, (-2,-1) add 20, (-2,-2) add 21.

Then move right: east, length 4: to (-1,-2) add 22, (0,-2) add 23, (1,-2) add 24, (2,-2) add 25.

Ends at (2,-2).

Now, check with earlier: for example, at (2,0):11, (2,1):12, (2,2):13, (1,2):14, (0,2):15, (-1,2):16, (-2,2):17, (-2,1):18, etc., seems consistent.

Now, for k=3, start at (3,1-3)=(3,-2) with number s3= (2*3-1)^2 +1 = 5^2 +1=26.

First move up, length 2*3-1=5, so to (3,-1) add 27, (3,0) add 28, (3,1) add 29, (3,2) add 30, (3,3) add 31.

Then left, length 6: to (2,3) add 32, (1,3) add 33, (0,3) add 34, (-1,3) add 35, (-2,3) add 36, (-3,3) add 37.

Then down, length 6: to (-3,2) add 38, (-3,1) add 39, (-3,0) add 40, (-3,-1) add 41, (-3,-2) add 42, (-3,-3) add 43.

Then right, length 6: to (-2,-3) add 44, (-1,-3) add 45, (0,-3) add 46, (1,-3) add 47, (2,-3) add 48, (3,-3) add 49.

Ends at (3,-3).

Good.

Now, we need to find the position of n=2026.

First, find which ring it is in.

Find k such that (2k-1)^2 < n <= (2k+1)^2.

Set m = 2k-1, then m^2 < n <= (m+2)^2.

Solve for k.

(2k-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2k+1)^2.

Take square roots.

2k-1 < sqrt(2026) <= 2k+1.

Compute sqrt(2026).

44^2=1936, 45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025=45^2, so sqrt(2026) ≈45.011, since 45^2=2025.

So 2k-1 < 45.011 <= 2k+1.

Now, since n>2025, so n> (45)^2, but 45 is odd, so is it 2k-1 or 2k+1?

Set 2k-1 = m, odd integer.

m^2 < n <= (m+2)^2.

Here m=45, m^2=2025.

So if n>2025, then n > m^2, so it could be in ring where upper bound is (m+2)^2=47^2=2209.

k is such that 2k-1 = m, so m odd.

For n=2026, since 2025=45^2, and 45=2k-1? Then 2k-1=45, so k=23.

Then upper bound (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209.

Lower bound (2*23-1)^2=45^2=2025.

But n=2026 > 2025, so is it in ring k=23? But the ring starts at (45)^2 +1 =2025+1=2026.

s_k = (2k-1)^2 +1 =45^2 +1=2026.

And ends at (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209.

So n=2026 is the first number in ring k=23.

Start of ring k=23.

Position: as above, for ring k, starts at (k, 1-k) = (23, 1-23) = (23, -22).

Now, the first move is up, with length 2k-1=45.

But since it's the start, and we need the neighbors, but first confirm the position.

n=2026 is at (23, -22).

Now, we need the eight neighbors: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.

That is, adjacent cells: (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1).

But only if they exist, but since it's a grid, and spiral covers all, but neighbors might not be filled if it's on the edge, but in this case, since it's a large grid, and n is large, probably neighbors exist, but we need to check if they are occupied by numbers.

The spiral fills all integer coordinates, so every cell has a number, so neighbors are defined.

But for the sum, we need the numbers at those positions.

So position of 2026 is (23,-22).

Neighbors:

N: (23,-21)

S: (23,-23)

E: (24,-22)

W: (22,-22)

NE: (24,-21)

NW: (22,-21)

SE: (24,-23)

SW: (22,-23)

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions.

Since the spiral is filled, each coordinate has a unique number, so we need a function that maps (x,y) to the number at that position.

We can compute the number for each neighbor coordinate.

Now, to find the number at a given (x,y).

First, note that the rings are symmetric, and we can find which ring a point is in, and its position in the ring.

The ring k is for |x| <= k, |y| <= k, but not both |x| < k and |y| < k, i.e., the boundary of the square from -k to k.

More precisely, the ring k consists of points where max(|x|,|y|) = k.

For example, k=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so points (1,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(-1,-1). But earlier we have 8 points: (1,0):2, (1,1):3, (0,1):4, (-1,1):5, (-1,0):6, (-1,-1):7, (0,-1):8, (1,-1):9. All have max(|x|,|y|)=1, since for (0,1), max(0,1)=1, etc. Good.

k=2: max(|x|,|y|)=2, points like (2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,-1),(2,-2), etc., total 8*2=16 points, which matches.

In general, for a point (x,y), let k = max(|x|,|y|). Then it is in ring k.

Now, the smallest number in ring k is s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1.

Now, we need to find where it is in the ring.

The ring is traversed in order: start at (k, 1-k), then move up, left, down, right.

For k=23, start at (23,-22).

Now, the path: move up for length L1 = 2k-1 = 45 steps? Earlier for k, first move length 2k-1.

In general, for ring k:

Start at (k, 1-k)

Then move up (increasing y) for L1 = 2k-1 steps? Steps mean number of moves, each move to adjacent cell.

In the move, we move to new cells, each step adds a cell.

From start position, move up: each step increases y by 1, x same.

After moving up L1 times, we reach (k, (1-k) + L1 )

Since we move up L1 steps, y increases by L1.

Start y=1-k, move up L1 steps, to y=1-k + L1.

L1=2k-1, so y=1-k + 2k-1 = k.

So reaches (k,k).

Then next move left: decreasing x, for L2 = 2k steps.

Move left L2 steps: from (k,k) to (k - L2, k) = (k - 2k, k) = (-k, k).

Then move down: decreasing y, for L3 = 2k steps.

From (-k,k) to (-k, k - 2k) = (-k, -k).

Then move right: increasing x, for L4 = 2k steps.

From (-k,-k) to (-k + 2k, -k) = (k, -k).

But for k=1, we ended at (1,-1), which is (k,-k), good.

But in the start, we started at (k,1-k), and ended at (k,-k).

Now, for a point (x,y) in ring k, we need to find its position in the traversal.

The traversal has four segments:

1. Up: from (k,1-k) to (k,k). y from 1-k to k, x=k constant.

Number of points: y increases from 1-k to k, so delta y = k - (1-k) = 2k-1, so number of points in this segment: (2k-1) + 1? The y values: min y=1-k, max y=k, so number of y values: k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 +k +1=2k.

But earlier we said length of move is L1=2k-1, meaning number of steps, so number of cells added in this move is L1=2k-1, but including the start? No.

In the move, when we move, we start from the start position, and each step we move to a new cell and place a number.

So for the first move: we are at start (k,1-k) with number s_k.

Then we move up: first step to (k,1-k+1), place next number.

Second step to (k,1-k+2), and so on, up to after L1 steps, we are at (k,1-k + L1) = (k,k), as above.

The number of cells covered in this segment: from y=1-k to y=k, inclusive.

The y-coordinates: start y_s = 1-k, end y_e = k.

Number of points: y_e - y_s + 1 = k - (1-k) + 1 = k -1 + k + 1 = 2k.

But the move consists of L1 steps, each step adds a new cell, so it adds L1 new cells, but the start cell is already occupied before the move, so total cells in segment: 1 (start) + L1 (added) = 1 + (2k-1) = 2k.

Yes, matches.

The numbers in this segment: from s_k to s_k + (2k - 1) - 1? The first number is s_k at (k,1-k).

Then after first step, number s_k +1 at (k,1-k+1)

After second step, s_k +2 at (k,1-k+2)

...

After L1-th step, at (k,k), number s_k + L1.

Since L1=2k-1, so at (k,k), number s_k + (2k-1).

The sequence: for a fixed x=k, y from 1-k to k, the number increases with y.

Specifically, number at (k,y) = s_k + (y - (1-k)) 

Since when y=1-k, number=s_k

y=1-k+1, number=s_k+1

...

y=k, number=s_k + (k - (1-k)) = s_k + (k -1 +k) = s_k + (2k-1)

As above.

Now, similarly, after this segment, we are at (k,k) with number s_k + (2k-1)

Then next segment: move left for L2=2k steps.

Start at (k,k), move left: decrease x, y constant.

First step to (k-1,k), place next number: s_k + (2k-1) + 1 = s_k + 2k

Then to (k-2,k), place s_k + 2k +1

...

After L2 steps, to (k - L2, k) = (k - 2k, k) = (-k,k), place number s_k + (2k-1) + L2 = s_k + (2k-1) + 2k = s_k + 4k -1

The segment: from x=k to x=-k, y=k constant.

x decreases from k to -k.

Number of points: k - (-k) + 1 = 2k+1? But should be L2 +1 = 2k +1? Earlier total cells: start + L2 added =1 + 2k = 2k+1, yes.

Numbers: at (x,k), for x from k down to -k.

When x=k, number=s_k + (2k-1)

x=k-1, number=s_k + (2k-1) +1 = s_k + 2k

x=k-2, s_k + 2k +1

...

x=-k, number=s_k + (2k-1) + (k - (-k)) ? The difference in x: from k to x, since x decreasing, the number of steps from k to x is k - x.

When x=k, index 0, number=s_k + (2k-1)

After first step, x=k-1, number=s_k + (2k-1) +1

After j steps, x=k-j, number=s_k + (2k-1) + j

Set j=k-x, since x decreases.

So number = s_k + (2k-1) + (k - x)

Since j=k-x.

So number = s_k + k - x + 2k -1 = s_k + 3k - x -1

At x=k, number=s_k + 3k -k -1=s_k +2k-1, good.

At x=-k, number=s_k +3k -(-k) -1=s_k +3k+k-1=s_k+4k-1, good.

Now, next segment: move down from (-k,k) to (-k,-k)

Move down: decrease y, x constant.

Length L3=2k steps.

Start at (-k,k) with number s_k +4k-1

Move down: first step to (-k,k-1), place s_k +4k-1 +1 = s_k +4k

Then to (-k,k-2), s_k+4k+1, etc.

After L3 steps, to (-k,k - 2k) = (-k,-k), place s_k +4k-1 + 2k = s_k +6k -1

Numbers: at (-k,y), y from k down to -k.

When y=k, number=s_k +4k-1

y=k-1, s_k+4k

...

y=-k, s_k+4k-1 + (k - (-k)) ? Difference in y: from k to y, y decreasing.

Number of steps: k - y

So number = s_k +4k-1 + (k - y) = s_k +5k - y -1

At y=k, s_k+5k-k-1=s_k+4k-1, good.

At y=-k, s_k+5k-(-k)-1=s_k+6k-1, good.

Finally, last segment: move right from (-k,-k) to (k,-k)

Move right: increase x, y constant.

Length L4=2k steps.

Start at (-k,-k) with number s_k +6k-1

Move right: to (-k+1,-k), place s_k+6k-1 +1 = s_k+6k

To (-k+2,-k), s_k+6k+1, etc.

After L4 steps, to (-k + 2k, -k) = (k,-k), place s_k +6k-1 + 2k = s_k +8k -1

But the end of ring is at (k,-k), and number should be (2k+1)^2, since ring ends there.

s_k = (2k-1)^2 +1

s_k +8k -1 = (2k-1)^2 +1 +8k -1 = (4k^2 -4k +1) +8k = 4k^2 +4k +1 = (2k+1)^2, yes, good.

Numbers: at (x,-k), x from -k to k.

Start x=-k, number=s_k +6k-1

x=-k+1, s_k+6k

...

x=k, s_k+6k-1 + (k - (-k)) ? Difference: from -k to x, increasing.

Number of steps: x - (-k) = x+k

So number = s_k +6k-1 + (x + k) = s_k +7k + x -1

At x=-k, s_k+7k -k -1=s_k+6k-1, good.

At x=k, s_k+7k+k-1=s_k+8k-1, good.

Now, summarize for a point (x,y) in ring k, with k=max(|x|,|y|).

The number depends on which side it is on.

Specifically:

- If it is on the top side: y=k, and |x| <= k, but since k=max(|x|,|y|), and y=k, so |x| <= k, but actually for top side, y=k, and x from -k to k, but in the traversal, it is covered in the left move segment.

From above:

- On the right side: x=k, y from 1-k to k. Covered in the up move segment.

Number: n = s_k + (y - (1-k)) 

Since when y=1-k, n=s_k, and increases with y.

y - (1-k) = y -1 +k

So n = s_k + (y + k - 1)

- On the top side: y=k, x from -k to k. Covered in the left move segment.

Number: n = s_k + (2k-1) + (k - x) = s_k + 3k - x -1

As earlier.

- On the left side: x=-k, y from -k to k. Covered in the down move segment.

Number: n = s_k + 5k - y -1

- On the bottom side: y=-k, x from -k to k. Covered in the right move segment.

Number: n = s_k + 7k + x -1

Now, for corners, it might be covered in multiple, but since corners are included, and the formulas should agree.

For example, top-right corner (k,k): on right side: n= s_k + (y + k -1) = s_k + (k + k -1) = s_k + 2k -1

On top side: n= s_k + 3k - x -1 = s_k + 3k -k -1 = s_k +2k-1, same.

Bottom-right (k,-k): on right side: n= s_k + (y + k -1) = s_k + (-k + k -1) = s_k -1? But should be end of ring.

s_k -1 = (2k-1)^2 +1 -1 = (2k-1)^2, but should be (2k+1)^2? No.

Mistake.

For right side, y from 1-k to k.

At y=-k, but for k>=1, 1-k <= -k? For k=1, y from 1-1=0 to 1, so y=0 and 1, not y=-1.

So (k,-k) is not on the right side; it's on the bottom side.

Similarly, for (k,-k), on bottom side: n= s_k +7k + x -1 = s_k +7k +k -1 = s_k +8k -1 = (2k+1)^2, as before.

Good.

Now, for our point, we have (x,y) = (23,-22) for n=2026.

k=max(|x|,|y|)=max(23,22)=23.

Now, which side? x=23, y=-22.

Since x=k=23, and y=-22, which is between 1-k=1-23=-22 and k=23? 1-k=-22, k=23, so y=-22 is equal to 1-k=-22.

So it is on the right side, specifically the start point.

On right side: y >= 1-k and y <= k, which is -22 to 23.

y=-22 is within [-22,23].

Since x=k, it's on the right side.

Number formula: n = s_k + (y + k - 1)

s_k = (2k-1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

k=23.

n = s_k + (y + k - 1) = 2026 + (-22 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + (0) = 2026.

y + k -1 = -22 + 23 -1 = 0, so n=2026 +0=2026, correct, as expected.

Now, we need the neighbors.

List them again:

1. N: (x,y+1) = (23,-21)

2. S: (23,-23)

3. E: (x+1,y) = (24,-22)

4. W: (x-1,y) = (22,-22)

5. NE: (24,-21)

6. NW: (22,-21)

7. SE: (24,-23)

8. SW: (22,-23)

Now, for each, we need to find k and the number.

Note that k for each neighbor might be different, since k=max(|x|,|y|).

So let's compute for each.

First, N: (23,-21)

x=23, y=-21

| x | =23, |y|=21

max=23, so k=23.

Now, which side? x=23=k, y=-21.

On right side? y >=1-k=1-23=-22, y<=k=23, yes -21 >= -22 and <=23.

So on right side.

Number: n = s_k + (y + k - 1)

s_k=2026 for k=23? s_k is same for all points in ring k, s_k=(2k-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2026.

k=23.

n=2026 + (-21 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + (1) = 2027.

y+k-1=-21+23-1=1, so 2026+1=2027.

Now, S: (23,-23)

x=23,y=-23

| x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, k=23.

On right side? y >=1-k=-22? -23 >= -22? No, -23 < -22.

So not on right side.

Now, y=-23, which is less than 1-k=-22.

Since k=max(|x|,|y|)=23, and y=-23, |y|=23=k, and x=23=k, so it's a corner.

Now, which side? Could be bottom or left, but since x=k, but y not in range.

The sides: bottom side is y=-k, top is y=k, left is x=-k, right is x=k.

Here x=23=k, y=-23=-k, so it's the bottom-right corner.

Which is on the bottom side, since y=-k.

Bottom side: y=-k, x from -k to k.

Here y=-23=-k, x=23=k.

So on bottom side.

Formula: n = s_k + 7k + x -1

s_k=2026, k=23, x=23

n=2026 + 7*23 + 23 -1 = 2026 + 161 + 23 -1? Compute: 7*23=161, plus 23=184, minus 1=183? Then 2026+183=2209.

But s_k +7k +x -1=2026 +161 +23 -1=2026 + (161+23-1)=2026+183=2209.

But 2209=47^2, which is the end of ring k=23, since (2*23+1)^2=47^2=2209, and it's at (k,-k)=(23,-23), which matches.

Good.

Now, E: (24,-22)

x=24,y=-22

| x|=24, |y|=22, max=24, so k=24.

Now, s_k for k=24: s_k=(2k-1)^2 +1=(48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Now, which side? x=24=k, y=-22.

On right side? y >=1-k=1-24=-23? -22 >= -23, yes, and y<=k=24, yes.

So on right side.

n= s_k + (y + k -1) = 2210 + (-22 + 24 -1) = 2210 + (1) = 2211.

y+k-1=-22+24-1=1, so 2210+1=2211.

Now, W: (22,-22)

x=22,y=-22

| x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, so k=22.

s_k=(2*22-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

Now, which side? x=22=k, y=-22.

On right side? y >=1-k=1-22=-21? -22 >= -21? No, -22 < -21.

So not right side.

y=-22, |y|=22=k, so bottom-right corner? But x=k=22, y=-k=-22, so bottom-right corner, on bottom side.

Bottom side: y=-k, x from -k to k.

n= s_k + 7k + x -1

s_k=1850, k=22, x=22

n=1850 + 7*22 + 22 -1 = 1850 + 154 + 22 -1 = 1850 + (154+22-1)=1850+175=2025.

154+22=176, minus 1=175, yes. 1850+175=2025.

But 2025=45^2, which is the end of ring k=22? Ring k=22 ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025, and position (22,-22), since for ring k, ends at (k,-k), yes.

Now, NE: (24,-21)

x=24,y=-21

| x|=24, |y|=21, max=24, k=24.

s_k=2210.

Now, which side? x=24=k, y=-21.

On right side? y >=1-k=1-24=-23? -21 >= -23, yes, and <=24, yes.

So n= s_k + (y + k -1) = 2210 + (-21 + 24 -1) = 2210 + (2) = 2212.

y+k-1=-21+24-1=2, so 2210+2=2212.

Now, NW: (22,-21)

x=22,y=-21

| x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, k=22.

s_k=1850.

Now, which side? x=22=k, y=-21.

On right side? y >=1-k=1-22=-21? -21 >= -21, yes, and <=22, yes.

So n= s_k + (y + k -1) = 1850 + (-21 + 22 -1) = 1850 + (0) = 1850.

y+k-1=-21+22-1=0, so 1850+0=1850.

Now, SE: (24,-23)

x=24,y=-23

| x|=24, |y|=23, max=24, k=24.

s_k=2210.

Now, which side? x=24=k, y=-23.

On right side? y >=1-k=-23? -23 >= -23, yes, and <=24, yes.

So n= s_k + (y + k -1) = 2210 + (-23 + 24 -1) = 2210 + (0) = 2210.

y+k-1=-23+24-1=0, so 2210+0=2210.

Now, SW: (22,-23)

x=22,y=-23

| x|=22, |y|=23, max=23? |y|=23>|x|=22, so k=23.

s_k for k=23 is 2026.

Now, which side? x=22, y=-23.

k=23, max(|x|,|y|)=max(22,23)=23.

Now, |y|=23=k, |x|=22<23, so it should be on the bottom or top side? Since y=-23, negative, probably bottom side.

Bottom side: y=-k, x from -k to k.

Here y=-23=-k, since k=23, and |x|=22<23, so yes, on bottom side.

Formula: n = s_k + 7k + x -1

s_k=2026, k=23, x=22

n=2026 + 7*23 + 22 -1 = 2026 + 161 + 22 -1 = 2026 + (161+22-1)=2026+182=2208.

161+22=183, minus 1=182, yes. 2026+182=2208.

Now, we have all neighbors:

List them:

N: (23,-21) : 2027

S: (23,-23) : 2209

E: (24,-22) : 2211

W: (22,-22) : 2025

NE: (24,-21) : 2212

NW: (22,-21) : 1850

SE: (24,-23) : 2210

SW: (22,-23) : 2208

Now, sum them up.

List:

2027, 2209, 2211, 2025, 2212, 1850, 2210, 2208

Add step by step.

First, group them.

Notice that some are consecutive or close.

Compute sum.

Add in pairs.

2027 + 2209 = 4236

2211 + 2025 = 4236? 2211+2000=4211, +25=4236, yes.

So 4236 + 4236 = 8472? No, these are two pairs.

2027+2209=4236

2211+2025=4236

Now NE:2212, NW:1850

2212+1850=4062

SE:2210, SW:2208

2210+2208=4418

Now sum these: 4236 (first pair) + 4236 (second pair) = 8472

Then 4062 (third) + 4418 (fourth) = 8480? 4062+4400=8462, +18=8480.

Now total: 8472 + 8480 = 16952

But that can't be right because earlier pairs are symmetric but not.

Better to add all together.

List the numbers:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Sort them: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Now sum.

First, 1850 is small.

Note that most are around 2200.

Sum = (1850) + (2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)

Compute each group.

2025 + 2027 = 4052

2208 + 2212 = 4420? 2200+2212=4412, +8=4420? No: 2208 + 2212 = 2200+2212=4412, plus 8? 2208 is 2200+8, but 2212 is already, no: 2208 + 2212 = (2200+8) + (2200+12) = 4400 + 20 = 4420? 8+12=20, yes.

2209 + 2211 = 2200+9 + 2200+11=4400+20=4420

And 2210 alone.

So the last five: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212

Sum: 2208+2212=4420

2209+2211=4420

2210=2210

Sum: 4420 + 4420 = 8840, plus 2210 = 8840 + 2210 = 11050

Now add the others: 1850 + 4052 = 5902? 1850+4000=5850, +52=5902.

Then total sum: 11050 + 5902 = 16952

Same as before.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a smaller example to see if the method is right.

Suppose we take n=1 at center.

Neighbors: should be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44.

But according to the spiral, yes.

Now, for n=2026, we have sum 16952, but let me see if it makes sense.

Notice that in our list, we have:

W:2025, which is 45^2

S:2209=47^2

NW:1850, which is s_{22}=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850

NE:2212, which is for (24,-21), k=24, on right side, n=2210 + (-21+24-1)=2210+2=2212? Earlier we have 2212.

But s_k=2210 for k=24, which is 47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Now, the neighbors include 2025=45^2, 2209=47^2, and others.

But sum is 16952.

But let me double-check the positions.

For SW: (22,-23), k=23, bottom side, x=22, n=2026 +7*23 +22 -1=2026+161+22-1=2026+182=2208? 161+22=183, minus 1=182, yes 2026+182=2208.

Is this correct? Ring k=23, bottom side, y=-23, x=22.

Formula n=s_k +7k +x -1=2026 +7*23 +22 -1=2026+161+22-1.

161+22=183, minus 1=182, total 2026+182=2208.

The end is at x=k=23, y=-k, n=2026+7*23+23-1=2026+161+23-1=2026+183=2209, as S neighbor.

And start of bottom side? When x=-k, n=s_k +7k +(-k) -1=2026+7*23 -23 -1=2026+161-23-1=2026+137=2163? But we don't need.

Now, NW: (22,-21), k=22, right side, n=1850 + (-21+22-1)=1850+0=1850.

s_k=1850 for k=22, which is 43^2 +1=1849+1=1850, and at (22,-22)? But here y=-21, not -22.

At (22,-21), since on right side, y=-21, n=1850 + (-21 +22 -1)=1850+0=1850, which is the start number, but should be at (22,1-22)=(22,-21)? For ring k=22, start at (k,1-k)=(22,-21), yes, so n=1850, correct.

Now, others seem consistent.

Now sum is 1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212

Add again.

Add the large ones: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Sum = (2200*5) + (8+9+10+11+12) = 11000 + (8+12=20, 9+11=20, 10=10, total 50) = 11000+50=11050? Earlier I had 11050 for five numbers, but here I have five: 2208 to 2212, yes sum 11050 as before.

Then 2025 and 2027: 2025+2027=4052

Then 1850

So total: 11050 + 4052 = 15102, plus 1850 = 16952.

15102 + 1850: 15100+1850=16950, plus 2? 15102 -15100=2, so 16950+2=16952.

Now, is there a better way? Notice that the neighbors form a 3x3 grid around (23,-22), but without the center.

The points are all the adjacent cells.

In the grid, the values might have some symmetry, but here it's not symmetric.

Since we have all, sum is 16952.

But let me confirm with n=2.

For n=2, at (1,0)

Neighbors: should be all eight: but in spiral, neighbors are: (1,1):3, (1,-1):9? (0,0):1, but 1 is center, but neighbors of 2 should exclude itself.

Standard neighbors: north: (1,1):3? In coordinates, if (x,y), N is (x,y+1), so for (1,0), N:(1,1):3

S:(1,-1):9

E:(2,0)? What is there? Earlier for k=1, we have up to 9, but (2,0) is not filled yet? In ring k=2, which starts at (2,-1):10, so (2,0) should be later.

In our earlier assignment, for n=10 at (2,-1), then up to (2,0):11, etc.

But for n=2 at (1,0), its neighbors:

N: (1,1):3

S: (1,-1):9

E: (2,0): but (2,0) is not in ring 1, ring 1 has max|x|,|y|=1, (2,0) has max=2, so in ring 2.

What number? At (2,0), from earlier, for ring k=2, start (2,-1):10, then move up to (2,0):11, (2,1):12, etc. So (2,0):11

W: (0,0):1

NE: (2,1):12? In ring 2.

NW: (0,1):4

SE: (2,-1):10? (2,-1) is start of ring 2, number 10.

SW: (0,-1):8

So neighbors: N:3, S:9, E:11, W:1, NE:12, NW:4, SE:10, SW:8.

Sum: 3+9+11+1+12+4+10+8.

Calculate: 3+9=12, 11+1=12, 12+4=16, 10+8=18.

Then 12+12=24, 16+18=34, total 24+34=58.

List:1,3,4,8,9,10,11,12. Sum:1+3=4,4+4=8,8+8=16,16+9=25,25+10=35,35+11=46,46+12=58.

Now, according to our method, for n=2 at (1,0), k=max(1,0)=1? |x|=1,|y|=0, max=1.

s_k=s1=2? But n=2 is here.

Position (1,0), k=1.

On right side? x=k=1, y=0.

y >=1-k=1-1=0? 0>=0, yes, and <=1, yes.

n=s_k + (y+k-1)=2 + (0+1-1)=2+0=2, correct.

Neighbors:

N: (1,1): x=1,y=1,k=max(1,1)=1, on right side? y=1>=0? yes, n=s1 + (y+k-1)=2+(1+1-1)=2+1=3, correct.

S: (1,-1): x=1,y=-1,k=max(1,1)=1, on right side? y=-1 >=1-k=0? -1>=0? no.

But |y|=1=k, |x|=1=k, so corner. Bottom-right? y=-1=-k, so bottom side.

n=s_k +7k +x -1=2 +7*1 +1 -1=2+7+1-1=9, correct.

E: (2,0): x=2,y=0,k=max(2,0)=2, s_k=s2=10? (2*2-1)^2 +1=9+1=10.

On right side? x=2=k, y=0 >=1-k=1-2=-1? 0>=-1, yes, <=2, yes.

n=10 + (0+2-1)=10+1=11, correct.

W: (0,0): x=0,y=0,k=max(0,0)=0? k=0.

Ring k=0, only one point, (0,0):1.

But what is the formula? For k=0, it's special.

In our earlier, for k=0, max(|x|,|y|)=0, only (0,0).

Number is 1.

But in the neighbor, W is (0,0):1.

Now NE: (2,1): x=2,y=1,k=max(2,1)=2, s_k=10.

On right side? x=2=k, y=1 >=1-2=-1, yes, <=2, yes.

n=10 + (1+2-1)=10+2=12, correct.

NW: (0,1): x=0,y=1,k=max(0,1)=1, s_k=2? But should be 4.

Which side? |x|=0<1, |y|=1=k, so top side? y=k=1.

Top side: n=s_k +3k -x -1=2 +3*1 -0 -1=2+3-1=4, correct.

SE: (2,-1): x=2,y=-1,k=max(2,1)=2? |x|=2,|y|=1, max=2.

s_k=10.

Which side? x=2=k, y=-1.

On right side? y>=1-k=-1? -1>=-1, yes, <=2, yes.

n=10 + (-1+2-1)=10+0=10, correct.

SW: (0,-1): x=0,y=-1,k=max(0,1)=1, s_k=2.

Bottom side? y=-1=-k, since k=1.

n=s_k +7k +x -1=2 +7*1 +0 -1=2+7-1=8, correct.

Sum:3+9+11+1+12+4+10+8=58, as before.

Now for our case, we have sum 16952.

But is there a pattern or easier way? Notice that for the center point, but here it's not center.

In this case, the point (23,-22) is on the right side, near the bottom.

The neighbors include points in different rings.

We have computed all, so sum is 16952.

But let me write them down:

N: 2027

S: 2209

E: 2211

W: 2025

NE: 2212

NW: 1850

SE: 2210

SW: 2208

Notice that N, E, NE are in ring 24? N: (23,-21) k=23? Earlier we have k=23 for N, since max(23,21)=23.

x=23,y=-21, |x|=23,|y|=21<23? max=23, yes k=23.

But E: (24,-22), k=24.

Similarly, NE: (24,-21), k=24.

S: (23,-23), k=23

W: (22,-22), k=22

NW: (22,-21), k=22

SE: (24,-23), k=24

SW: (22,-23), k=23

So rings: NW and W in ring 22; N,S,SW in ring 23; E,NE,SE in ring 24.

Now sums:

Ring 22: NW:1850, W:2025, sum 1850+2025=3875

Ring 23: N:2027, S:2209, SW:2208, sum 2027+2209+2208

2027+2208=4035, plus 2209=4035+2209=6244? 4035+2200=6235, +9=6244.

Ring 24: E:2211, NE:2212, SE:2210, sum 2211+2212+2210

2211+2210=4421, plus 2212=4421+2212=6633? 4421+2200=6621, +12=6633.

Now total sum: ring22:3875, ring23:6244, ring24:6633

Sum: 3875 + 6244 = 10119

Then 10119 + 6633 = 16752? 10119+6600=16719, +33=16752? But earlier we had 16952, inconsistency.

What? 16752 vs 16952, difference of 200.

Mistake in calculation.

Ring23 sum: N:2027, S:2209, SW:2208

2027 + 2208 = 4235? Earlier I said 4035, mistake.

2027 + 2208: 2000+2200=4200, 27+8=35, total 4235.

Then plus S:2209: 4235 + 2209 = 6444? 4235+2200=6435, +9=6444.

Earlier I said 6244, wrong.

Similarly, ring24: E:2211, NE:2212, SE:2210

2211 + 2210 = 4421? 2210+2210=4420, but 2211 is one more? 2211+2210=4421, yes.

Then plus NE:2212: 4421 + 2212 = 6633, same as before.

Ring22:1850+2025=3875

Now sum: ring22:3875, ring23:6444, ring24:6633

Now 3875 + 6444 = 10319? 3800+6400=10200, 75+44=119, total 10319.

Then 10319 + 6633 = 16952? 10319+6600=16919, +33=16952. Yes.

So correct.

Total sum is 16952.

Now, to box the answer.

But is this the sum of neighbors? Yes.

We can write it as 16952.

But let me confirm the addition once more.

List: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Add in order:

Start with 1850

+2025 = 3875

+2027 = 3875+2027=5902? 3875+2000=5875, +27=5902

+2208 = 5902+2208=8110? 5900+2200=8100, 2+8=10, total 8110

+2209 = 8110+2209=10319? 8110+2200=10310, +9=10319? Earlier we had 10319 for ring22+23, but here we have more.

After adding 2208, we have 8110, then +2209=8110+2209.

8110+2200=10310, +9=10319.

Then +2210=10319+2210=12529? 10319+2200=12519, +10=12529? 2210-2200=10, yes.

10319+2210: 10000+2210=12210, 319+0? Better: 10319 + 2210 = 12529.

Then +2211=12529+2211=14740? 12529+2200=14729, +11=14740.

12529+2211: 12500+2211=14711, +29=14740? 14711+29=14740, yes.

Then +2212=14740+2212=16952? 14740+2200=16940, +12=16952. Yes.

So sum is 16952.

Therefore, the sum of all eight neighbors is 16952.

So the answer is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (0,0) contains the number 1. The eight neighbors of 2026 are the numbers at the adjacent positions: north (23, -21), south (23, -23), east (24, -22), west (22, -22), northeast (24, -21), northwest (22, -21), southeast (24, -23), and southwest (22, -23).

To find the numbers at these positions, determine the ring number \(k\) for each neighbor, where \(k = \max(|x|, |y|)\). The smallest number in ring \(k\) is \(s_k = (2k-1)^2 + 1\). The number at a given position depends on which side of the ring it lies:
- Right side (\(x = k\)): \(n = s_k + (y + k - 1)\)
- Top side (\(y = k\)): \(n = s_k + 3k - x - 1\)
- Left side (\(x = -k\)): \(n = s_k + 5k - y - 1\)
- Bottom side (\(y = -k\)): \(n = s_k + 7k + x - 1\)

The neighbors and their corresponding numbers are:
- North (23, -21): \(k = 23\), right side, \(n = 2026 + (-21 + 23 - 1) = 2027\)
- South (23, -23): \(k = 23\), bottom side, \(n = 2026 + 7 \times 23 + 23 - 1 = 2209\)
- East (24, -22): \(k = 24\), right side, \(n = 2210 + (-22 + 24 - 1) = 2211\) (where \(s_{24} = 47^2 + 1 = 2210\))
- West (22, -22): \(k = 22\), bottom side, \(n = 1850 + 7 \times 22 + 22 - 1 = 2025\) (where \(s_{22} = 43^2 + 1 = 1850\))
- Northeast (24, -21): \(k = 24\), right side, \(n = 2210 + (-21 + 24 - 1) = 2212\)
- Northwest (22, -21): \(k = 22\), right side, \(n = 1850 + (-21 + 22 - 1) = 1850\)
- Southeast (24, -23): \(k = 24\), right side, \(n = 2210 + (-23 + 24 - 1) = 2210\)
- Southwest (22, -23): \(k = 23\), bottom side, \(n = 2026 + 7 \times 23 + 22 - 1 = 2208\)

The sum of these neighbors is:
\[
1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952
\]

\boxed{16952}
