<think>
The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It shows:

... 5 4 3 ...
... 6 1 2 ...
... 7 8 9 ...

I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026. First, I must understand the layout of the spiral. It starts with 1 at the center, then 2 to the right, 3 up, 4 left, 5 left again? Looking at the grid:

It seems like 1 is at the center, 2 is to the right of 1, 3 is above 2, but in the grid it's shown as 5,4,3 on top, so probably:

Let me sketch this out. Assume the center is (0,0) for simplicity.

So, position (0,0) is 1.

Then moving right to (1,0) is 2.

Then up to (1,1) is 3.

Then left to (0,1) is 4? But in the grid it shows 5,4,3, so probably:

The sequence given: top row: 5,4,3

Middle row: 6,1,2

Bottom row: 7,8,9

So, relative to center (0,0):

At (0,0): 1

At (1,0): 2

At (1,1): 3? But 3 is above 2, which would be (1,1), but in the grid, above 1 is 4? Let's list the positions.

From the grid:

- (1,1): 5? I need to assign coordinates.

Set (0,0) at 1, as it's the center.

Then, to the right: (1,0) is 2.

Above 2: but in the grid, above 1 is 4? The grid shows:

Row above: 5,4,3 — so probably x from left to right, y from bottom to top or top to bottom? Typically in grids, y increases up.

But in the bottom row it's 7,8,9, so if bottom row is y=0, then middle row y=1, top row y=2? But then center is at (1,1) if it's a 3x3 grid.

The grid is shown with three rows, but it's part of a larger spiral, so coordinates might be absolute.

I should define the coordinate system.

Assume that the center 1 is at (0,0).

Then, moving right to (1,0) for 2.

Then, moving up to (1,1) for 3.

Then, moving left to (0,1) for 4.

Then, moving left to (-1,1) for 5.

Then, moving down to (-1,0) for 6.

Then, moving down to (-1,-1) for 7.

Then, moving right to (0,-1) for 8.

Then, moving right to (1,-1) for 9.

Then next would be up to (2,-1) for 10, but let's verify with the given grid.

In the grid:

Top row: probably y=1: positions x=-1,0,1: 5 at (-1,1), 4 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1)? But according to above, at (1,1) is 3, (0,1) is 4, (-1,1) is 5, yes.

Middle row: y=0: x=-1,0,1: 6 at (-1,0), 1 at (0,0), 2 at (1,0). According to above, (-1,0) is 6, (0,0) is 1, (1,0) is 2, good.

Bottom row: y=-1: x=-1,0,1: 7 at (-1,-1), 8 at (0,-1), 9 at (1,-1). Above: (-1,-1) is 7, (0,-1) is 8, (1,-1) is 9, perfect.

So the spiral goes: start at (0,0)=1, right to (1,0)=2, up to (1,1)=3, left to (0,1)=4, left to (-1,1)=5, down to (-1,0)=6, down to (-1,-1)=7, right to (0,-1)=8, right to (1,-1)=9, then up to (1,0) but (1,0) is already occupied, so after 9, it should go up to (1,0)? No, (1,0) is taken, so probably it continues up to (2,-1)? From (1,-1)=9, next move should be up, but to where? (1,0) is already taken, so it must go to (2,-1)? But (2,-1) is not adjacent.

I need to see the direction. After placing 9 at (1,-1), the next number is 10. Where is it? From the spiral pattern, after going right to (1,-1), it should turn up, but (1,0) is occupied, so it goes up to (1,0)? But that's taken. Perhaps I missed a step.

After 7 at (-1,-1), it went right to (0,-1)=8, then right to (1,-1)=9. Now, to continue, it should go up, but the cell above (1,-1) is (1,0), which is already occupied by 2. So instead, it turns right again? But that would be to (2,-1), which is empty. So 10 at (2,-1).

Then from there, it should go up, so to (2,0), but (2,0) is empty, so 11 at (2,0)? Then up to (2,1), but (2,1) is empty, 12 at (2,1)? Then left to (1,1), but (1,1) is occupied by 3, so it turns left to (1,1)? No, occupied, so it must go to (0,1)? Also occupied. I'm messing up.

Standard Ulam spiral or something. I recall that in such spirals, after completing a layer, it moves to the next.

Notice that from 1 to 9, it's a 3x3 grid centered at 1. Then 10 is to the right of 9, so at (2,-1)=10.

Then it goes up: to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? But (2,2) is above (2,1).

Then left to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17? Then down to (-2,1)=18, (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21, then right to (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25, and so on.

Let me verify with a small number. For example, number 10: according to this, at (2,-1). Is that correct? From center: after 9 at (1,-1), moving right to (2,-1)=10, yes.

11 at (2,0), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2), 14 at (1,2), 15 at (0,2), 16 at (-1,2), 17 at (-2,2), 18 at (-2,1), 19 at (-2,0), 20 at (-2,-1), 21 at (-2,-2), 22 at (-1,-2), 23 at (0,-2), 24 at (1,-2), 25 at (2,-2), then next would be up to (2,-1) but occupied, so right to (3,-2)=26, etc.

Now, to confirm, number 3 is at (1,1), number 4 at (0,1), etc., as before.

Now, I need to find the position of 2026 in this spiral.

Since the spiral is symmetric, I can find which "layer" or "ring" it's in.

Notice that the central cell is 1.

The first ring around it: numbers 2 through 9, which is 8 numbers, forming a 3x3 grid minus center, but actually it's a ring of size 1.

Define the ring number k.

For k=0: just the center, number 1.

Size: 1 cell.

For k=1: the next ring, from 2 to 9, which has 8 numbers, and it goes from (1,0) to (1,-1), covering max |x|=1, |y|=1, but not center.

The maximum coordinate magnitude in ring k: for k=0, max |x| or |y| is 0.

k=1: max |x| or |y| is 1.

k=2: from 10 to 25, max |x| or |y| is 2.

10 at (2,-1), |x|=2, |y|=1, but max is 2 since (2,2) is in it.

In ring k=2, numbers 10 to 25, total numbers: 25-10+1=16, which is 8*2? 8k for ring k? k starts from 1.

Ring k=1: numbers 2 to 9, 8 numbers.

Ring k=2: 10 to 25? 25-10+1=16, which is 8*2.

Ring k=3: should be 26 to ? 8*3=24 numbers? Total numbers up to ring k is 1 + 8*(1+2+...+k) = 1 + 8*k(k+1)/2 = 1 + 4k(k+1)

The last number in ring k.

Ring k starts after ring k-1.

The first number in ring k.

For ring k, the smallest number in that ring.

Ring 0: number 1.

Ring 1: starts at 2.

Ring 2: starts at 10.

Ring 3: should start at 26? After 25, next is 26 at (3,-2)? Earlier I said (3,-2)=26.

Now, ring k starts at what number?

The last number of ring k-1 is the largest number with max coordinate magnitude k-1.

The size of ring k: for k>=1, it has 8k numbers? Ring 1:8, ring2:16? That's not constant.

Notice that ring k has side length 2k+1? For example, up to ring k, the grid is (2k+1) x (2k+1).

For k=0: 1x1 grid, numbers 1.

For k=1: 3x3 grid, numbers 1 to 9.

For k=2: 5x5 grid, numbers 1 to 25.

Yes! Exactly. Because 1 to 1:1, 1 to 9:9=3^2, 1 to 25:25=5^2, so up to ring k, the largest number is (2k+1)^2.

Ring k corresponds to the k-th layer, but in terms of the square size.

Define n such that the square from -n to n in both x and y has size (2n+1) x (2n+1), and contains numbers 1 to (2n+1)^2.

For example, n=0: size 1x1, number 1.

n=1: size 3x3, numbers 1 to 9.

n=2: size 5x5, numbers 1 to 25.

n=3: size 7x7, numbers 1 to 49.

Yes.

Now, the ring for a given n consists of numbers from (2n-1)^2 + 1 to (2n+1)^2.

For n=1: from (2*1-1)^2 +1 =1^2 +1=2 to 3^2=9, yes.

For n=2: from (3)^2 +1=10 to 5^2=25, yes.

For n=3: from (5)^2 +1=26 to 7^2=49, yes.

Now, the number 2026 is in some ring. I need to find n such that (2n-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2n+1)^2.

Set m = 2n+1, so m is odd, and m^2 >= 2026, and (m-2)^2 < 2026.

Since m is odd, let me compute the smallest odd integer m such that m^2 >= 2026.

Compute sqrt(2026).

45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

45 is odd, 45^2=2025.

2025 < 2026, so 2025 is less than 2026, so m^2 >=2026, smallest odd m? 45 is odd, but 45^2=2025<2026, so next odd is 47? 47^2=2209.

But 46 is even, but since m must be odd, yes, m=47.

m=2n+1, so for n, (2n+1)^2 >=2026, and (2n-1)^2 <2026.

45^2=2025<2026, so (2n-1)^2 <=2025? 2n-1=45? Since 45 is odd.

Set k=2n-1, the previous odd number.

The largest odd integer whose square is less than or equal to 2025? But 2025=45^2, so k=45.

Then (2n-1)^2 = k^2 =45^2=2025.

Then the ring starts at (2n-1)^2 +1 =2025+1=2026.

But is 2026 in this ring or the next?

Ring for n: from (2n-1)^2 +1 to (2n+1)^2.

Here (2n-1)^2 =45^2=2025, so ring starts at 2026.

But (2n+1)^2 =? Since 2n-1=45, so 2n=46, n=23, then 2n+1=47, so (47)^2=2209.

So ring n=23: from 2026 to 2209.

But 2026 is the first number in this ring.

Now, what is its position?

In ring n, the numbers go from (2n-1)^2 +1 to (2n+1)^2.

The ring has size: (2n+1)^2 - (2n-1)^2 = [4n^2 +4n +1] - [4n^2 -4n +1] = 8n.

So 8n numbers in ring n.

For n=23, 8*23=184 numbers, from 2026 to 2026+183=2209? 2026+183=2209? 2026-1=2025, 2209-2025=184, yes, since 2026 to 2209 inclusive is 2209-2026+1=184, yes.

Now, the ring starts at position? Where is the first number placed.

In the spiral, for each ring, it starts at a certain point.

From earlier examples:

For n=1, ring starts at 2, which is at (1,0).

For n=2, starts at 10, at (2,-1).

For n=3, starts at 26, at (3,-2)? Earlier I thought (3,-2).

Pattern: for n=1: start at (1,0)

n=2: (2,-1)

n=3: (3,-2)

So it seems at (n, -(n-1))? For n=1: (1,-0)? But it's (1,0), not (1,-0).

( n, 1-n )? n=1: (1,0), yes. n=2: (2,-1), yes. n=3: (3,-2), yes.

1-n: for n=1, 1-1=0, (1,0); n=2,1-2=-1,(2,-1); n=3,1-3=-2,(3,-2). Perfect.

So for ring n, starts at (n, 1-n) with number (2n-1)^2 +1.

In this case, n=23, starts at (23, 1-23) = (23,-22) with number 2026? (2*23-1)^2 +1=45^2 +1=2025+1=2026, yes.

Now, the spiral proceeds in a certain direction. From the start, it moves in which direction?

For n=1: start at (1,0)=2, then moves up to (1,1)=3? But in the sequence, after 2 is 3 at (1,1), which is up.

But in terms of direction: from (1,0) to (1,1), that's increasing y, so up.

Then from (1,1) to (0,1)=4, which is left, decreasing x.

Then to (-1,1)=5, left again.

Then to (-1,0)=6, down.

Then to (-1,-1)=7, down.

Then to (0,-1)=8, right.

Then to (1,-1)=9, right.

So directions: start at (n,1-n), then move up, left, down, right? But in this case for n=1: start (1,0), move up to (1,1), then left to (0,1), left to (-1,1), then down to (-1,0), down to (-1,-1), then right to (0,-1), right to (1,-1).

But after moving left twice? From (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), that's two steps left? But for larger n, it might be more.

In general, for ring n, it moves right for a certain distance, but in this case, it starts by moving up.

The movement: after placing the first number, it moves in a direction, and each "side" of the ring has a certain length.

For ring n, each side has length: since it's a square ring, but not exactly, because corners are shared.

The ring consists of four sides, but each side has how many cells?

For example, n=1: side length? From (1,0) to (1,1) is one move, but cells: from start (1,0) to (1,1): two cells? Positions: (1,0) and (1,1), but (1,0) is start, then (1,1) is next.

But the side: actually, for ring n, the side length (number of cells per side) is 2n.

For n=1: side length should be 2? But we have only 8 cells, 4 sides, each should have 2 cells? But 4*2=8, yes.

But in the path: start at (1,0), then move up to (1,1) — that's one step, but two cells: the start and after move.

The path moves along the ring, visiting each cell once.

The direction of movement: it moves along the perimeter.

For ring n, starting at (n, 1-n).

Then it moves in the positive y-direction (up) for a distance of... how many steps?

From start, it moves up to the top-right corner.

In n=1: from (1,0) to (1,1), so moves up 1 step? But distance: y from 0 to 1, delta y=1, but number of moves: one move, but covers two cells? When it moves from one cell to adjacent, it places a number in the new cell.

At start, it places number at first cell. Then it moves to adjacent cell and places next number.

So for the first move: from (n,1-n) to (n,1-n +1)? For n=1: from (1,0) to (1,1), so y increases by 1.

Then from (1,1) to (0,1), x decreases by 1.

Then to (-1,1), x decreases by 1 again? But for n=1, it stops there? Then down to (-1,0), etc.

The length of each "leg" of the move.

For ring n, the displacement: from start, it moves up by (2n-1) steps? For n=1: moves up by 1 step? From y=0 to y=1, but only one move, but the number of cells covered in that direction: when moving up, it places numbers at y=0,1? But y=0 is already placed, so when moving up, it places numbers at increasing y, starting from y=1-n to ? 

For n=1, start at (1,0), then move up to (1,1), so it places two cells in the up direction: (1,0) and (1,1)? But (1,0) is the start, and (1,1) is after move.

But in terms of the path, the segment in the up direction consists of the cells from (n, y_min) to (n, y_max).

For ring n, the x and y range from -n to n, but excluding the inner part.

Specifically, for the right side: x=n, y from -n+1 to n? But for n=1: x=1, y from -0? to 1? But in n=1, cells at (1,0),(1,1),(1,-1)? (1,-1) is also there.

Actually, for ring n, the cells are those where max(|x|,|y|) = n.

Since the inner grid max(|x|,|y|) <= n-1 is filled.

So for ring n, max(|x|,|y|) = n.

Now, the path: it starts at (n, 1-n), which is on the right side? For n=1: (1,0), which is on the bottom-right? But max(|x|,|y|)=1, yes.

Then it moves up along x=n, to (n,n).

For n=1: to (1,1).

How many steps? From y=1-n to y=n.

y starts at 1-n, ends at n, so delta y = n - (1-n) = 2n-1? But number of moves: from y=1-n to y=n, the y-coordinates: 1-n, 2-n, ..., n. So number of y-values: n - (1-n) +1 = n -1 +n +1=2n.

For example, n=1: y=0 to y=1, values 0,1, two values? But only two cells: (1,0) and (1,1). But in the path, it places number at (1,0) first, then moves to (1,1) and places next number. So for the up move, it places numbers at (n,y) for y from 1-n to n? But for n=1, y from 0 to 1, but it places two numbers: first at y=0, then at y=1.

But the segment has two cells. But in terms of direction, it's moving up, but only one move? From (1,0) to (1,1) is one move, placing two numbers? When it is at (1,0), it places number (say s), then moves to (1,1) and places s+1.

So for the up segment, it moves up by (2n-1)? For n=1, moves up by 1 step, covering 2 cells? But 2 cells, but the displacement is 1 unit.

The number of cells in the segment: for the up direction, it has how many cells.

In ring n, on the right side (x=n), y ranges from -n to n, but excluding corners? No, corners are included.

For x=n, y from -n to n, but that's 2n+1 cells, but shared with top and bottom.

But in the ring, since it's the perimeter, but for the path, it traverses each side.

Specifically, for the right side, but excluding the corners where it turns.

In standard spiral, for ring n, it moves:

- Up: along x=n, from y=1-n to y=n. 

For n=1: from y=0 to y=1? But y=0 to y=1, but only one step.

The y-coordinates: starts at y=1-n, ends at y=n.

The values: min y = 1-n, max y = n.

Number of cells: from y=1-n to y=n inclusive, so number is n - (1-n) + 1 = 2n.

For n=1: 2*1=2 cells: (1,0),(1,1). Yes.

Then after reaching (n,n), it moves left along y=n, from x=n to x=-n+1? For n=1: at (1,1), moves left to (0,1). Then to (-1,1)? But for n=1, it goes to (-1,1), which is x=-1.

So from x=n to x= -n? 

For n=1: from x=1 to x=-1? But only two moves? From (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), so x from 1 to 0 to -1, so three cells? But earlier I said side length 2n, for n=1 should be 2, but here three cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1).

Inconsistency.

For ring n=1, total cells 8, but if each side has 2 cells, but corners are shared, so total should be 4 sides * 2 cells - 4 corners? But corners are counted in two sides, standard way: for a square ring, number of cells is perimeter minus corners or something.

For a ring at distance n, the side length (in cells) is 2n.

For n=1: side length 2, total cells 4*2 =8, but since each corner is shared? In a path, when traversing, each corner is visited once, so total cells should be 4 * (side length) but since corners are included in adjacent sides, but in a closed path, but here it's not closed, but for the ring, it's a cycle, but in spiral it's traversed linearly.

In this spiral, for each ring, the path starts at (n,1-n), ends at (n,-n)? For n=1: starts (1,0), ends (1,-1)? But (1,-1) is 9.

The path: from start to end, it visits all 8n cells.

The segments: 

- First segment: move up along x=n, from y=1-n to y=n. Number of cells: as above, y from 1-n to n inclusive, number is n - (1-n) +1 = 2n.

For n=1: y from 0 to 1, cells: (1,0),(1,1) — two cells, but it places numbers at both, so segment has 2 cells.

But in the move, from start (1,0) to (1,1), so one move, but two cells covered.

After that, at (n,n), it moves left along y=n, from x=n to x= ? For n=1, from (1,1) to (0,1), then to (-1,1)? So to x=-1.

x from n to -n? But for n=1, x from 1 to -1.

Number of cells: x=n, n-1, ..., -n. So from x=n to x=-n, number of cells: n - (-n) +1 = 2n+1.

For n=1: x=1,0,-1, three cells. But earlier for up segment only two.

Total cells: for up segment: 2 cells (for n=1), left segment: should be more.

After moving up to (n,n), it moves left to (n-1,n), (n-2,n), ..., down to x= -n +1? But in n=1, it went to (0,1), then (-1,1), so to x=-n = -1.

But then from there, it moves down to (-1,0), etc.

The x-range for left move: from x=n to x= -n.

Values: n, n-1, ..., -n. Number: n - (-n) +1 = 2n+1.

But for n=1, 3 cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1).

But total cells so far: up segment 2 cells, left segment 3 cells, total 5, but ring has 8 cells, so missing some.

Then it moves down to (-1,0), etc.

From (-1,1) it moves down to (-1,0), then to (-1,-1)? For n=1.

So down along x= -n, y from n to -n? From y=1 to y=0 to y=-1.

y from n to -n, number: n - (-n) +1 =2n+1.

For n=1, y=1,0,-1, three cells: (-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1).

But (-1,1) is already counted in left segment? Oh, problem.

The cell (-1,1) is the corner, and it is visited when moving left, but when moving down, it starts from there again? No, in the path, it is visited only once.

For n=1: path is: (1,0)-2, (1,1)-3, (0,1)-4, (-1,1)-5, (-1,0)-6, (-1,-1)-7, (0,-1)-8, (1,-1)-9.

So cells: (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1).

Now, the segments:

- From (1,0) to (1,1): up, two cells.

- From (1,1) to (-1,1): left, three cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1). But (1,1) is shared with previous segment.

In terms of moves, each move is to a new cell, but the starting cell of a segment is the same as the ending cell of previous segment.

So for the left segment, it starts at (1,1) and ends at (-1,1), so cells covered: (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1) — three cells, but since (1,1) is the end of previous, it's included in both if we count cells, but in the path, each cell is unique.

To avoid double-counting, we should consider the cells added in each segment.

For the first segment (up): cells with x=n, y from 1-n to n. For n=1: x=1, y=0 and y=1. Two cells.

But it starts at y=1-n=0, ends at y=n=1.

Then next segment (left): moves left along y=n, from x=n to x= -n. But it starts at (n,n), which is already visited, so the new cells are from x=n-1 down to x= -n.

For n=1: from x=0 to x=-1? Cells: (0,1), (-1,1). Two cells, since (1,1) is already done.

In general, for the left segment, it moves from (n,n) to (-n,n), but since (n,n) is already visited, it places numbers at x=n-1, n-2, ..., -n, y=n. So number of cells: from x=n-1 to x= -n, which is (n-1) - (-n) +1 = n-1 +n +1=2n.

For n=1: x=0 to x=-1? 0 to -1, number: 0,-1, two cells: (0,1),(-1,1). Yes.

Then next segment: down, along x= -n, from y=n to y= -n. But starts at (-n,n), which is already visited, so new cells from y=n-1 down to y= -n.

For n=1: y=0 to y=-1? Cells: (-1,0), (-1,-1). Two cells.

Then next segment: right, along y= -n, from x= -n to x=n. Starts at (-n,-n), already visited, so new cells from x= -n+1 to x=n.

For n=1: x=0 to x=1? Cells: (0,-1), (1,-1). Two cells.

Total: 2+2+2+2=8, perfect.

And for each segment, 2n cells? For n=1, each segment has 2 cells, but 2*1=2, yes.

But earlier I said for left segment, from x=n-1 to x=-n, number is [n-1] - [-n] +1 = n-1 +n +1=2n, yes.

Similarly for others.

Now, directions:

- First segment: move up (positive y) along x=n.

- Second segment: move left (negative x) along y=n.

- Third segment: move down (negative y) along x= -n.

- Fourth segment: move right (positive x) along y= -n.

And each segment has exactly 2n cells.

For n=23, ring starts at (23,1-23)=(23,-22) with number 2026.

Now, it moves up first.

So, along x=23, y from -22 to ? 

The segment moves up from y= -22 to y_max.

Since it moves up to y=n=23, and starts at y=1-n=-22, and moves to y=n=23.

But as per above, the cells covered: y from 1-n to n, inclusive, which is y=-22 to y=23.

Number: 23 - (-22) +1 = 23+22+1=46, and 2n=46, yes.

But since it starts at (23,-22), and moves up, so the y-coordinates increase.

The sequence of y: starts at y=-22, then moves to y=-21, -20, ..., up to y=23.

So y increases from -22 to 23.

The numbers placed: first cell: (23,-22) = 2026.

Then (23,-21) = 2027.

(23,-20) = 2028.

...

Up to (23,23) = ?

The last y in this segment is y=23.

The number at (23,y) is 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22.

When y=-22, number=2026 + (-22) +22 =2026.

When y= -21, 2026 + (-21) +22 = 2026 +1=2027.

When y=0, 2026 +0 +22=2048.

When y=23, 2026 +23 +22=2026+45=2071.

Compute: delta y = y - (-22) = y +22.

So number = 2026 + (y +22) - ? When y=-22, delta y=0, number=2026.

After k steps, y = -22 + k, number = 2026 + k.

Set k=0 at start, y=-22, num=2026.

After first move, k=1, y=-21, num=2027.

At y=y_k, k = y - (-22) = y +22.

So num = 2026 + (y +22).

At y=23, num=2026 +23+22=2026+45=2071.

Total cells in segment: from y=-22 to y=23, inclusive, number of integers: 23 - (-22) +1=23+22+1=46, and 2026 to 2071 is 2071-2026+1=46, yes.

Now, after this, at (23,23), it moves left along y=23.

So now, direction left, negative x.

Starts at (23,23), which has number 2071.

Then moves to (22,23), number 2072.

Then (21,23), etc., down to x= -23? But as per earlier, it moves to x= -n = -23.

But since it starts at x=23, and moves left, and the segment covers x from n-1 down to -n, i.e., from 22 down to -23.

Number of cells: from x=22 to x=-23, inclusive? Values 22,21,...,-23.

Number: 22 - (-23) +1=22+23+1=46, same as 2n=46.

Now, the number: starts at (23,23)=2071.

Then (22,23)=2072.

(21,23)=2073.

...

Down to (-23,23)=?

The sequence: x decreases from 23 to ? But starts at x=23, but since it's already visited, the new cells are from x=22 down to x=-23.

So x starts at 22, ends at -23.

At x=x_j, j from 0 to ? 

When x=22, number=2072? After first move: from (23,23) to (22,23), so (22,23) is 2072.

Then (21,23)=2073, etc.

So at position (x,23), with x decreasing from 22 to -23.

The number: when x=22, num=2072.

x=21,2073.

...

x= -23, num=?

The delta x: from x=22 to x=x, the decrease is 22 - x.

Set k=0 at x=22, num=2072.

Then num = 2072 + k, and x=22 - k.

When k=0, x=22, num=2072.

k=1, x=21, num=2073.

So num = 2072 + k, and k = 22 - x.

Thus num = 2072 + (22 - x) = 2094 - x.

At x=22, 2094-22=2072, yes.

At x=0, num=2094 -0=2094.

At x=-23, num=2094 - (-23)=2094+23=2117.

Total cells: from x=22 to x=-23, step -1, number: 22 - (-23) +1=45? 22 to -23 inclusive.

The values: 22,21,...,0,...,-23.

Number: 22 - (-23) +1=22+23+1=46, yes.

Numbers: 2072 to 2072+45=2117? 2072 +45=2117, yes, since 46 cells, first 2072, last 2072+45=2117.

2072 + (46-1) =2072+45=2117, yes.

Now, next segment: move down along x= -n = -23.

Starts at (-23,23), which is the end of previous segment, number 2117.

Then moves down to (-23,22), etc.

Direction down, negative y.

Starts at (-23,23), already visited, so new cells from y=22 down to y= -n? To y= -23.

y from n-1=22 down to -23.

Number: y=22 to y=-23, inclusive, step -1.

Number: 22 - (-23) +1=22+23+1=46.

Numbers: starts at (-23,22)? After first move: from (-23,23) to (-23,22), so (-23,22) is next number, 2118.

Then (-23,21)=2119, etc.

Down to (-23,-23)=?

At (x,y)=(-23,y), y decreasing from 22 to -23.

Set k=0 at y=22, num=2118.

Then num=2118 + k, y=22 - k.

So num=2118 + (22 - y) ? When y=22, num=2118 +0=2118.

y=21, num=2118 + (22-21)=2118+1=2119, yes.

y=0, num=2118 + (22-0)=2140.

y=-23, num=2118 + (22 - (-23)) =2118 + 22 +23=2118+45=2163.

k = 22 - y, num=2118 + k =2118 + (22 - y) = 2140 - y.

At y=-23, num=2140 - (-23)=2140+23=2163.

Total: 2118 to 2163, difference 45, number 46 cells.

Now, last segment: move right along y= -n = -23.

Starts at (-23,-23), which is end of previous, number 2163.

Then moves right to (-22,-23), etc.

Direction right, positive x.

Starts at (-23,-23), already visited, so new cells from x= -22 to x= n? To x=23? But n=23.

x from -22 to 23? But earlier for n=1 it was to x=1.

As per earlier, from x= -n +1 to x=n.

For n=1: x=0 to x=1? Earlier we had (0,-1),(1,-1).

So x from -(n-1) to n? For n=1: x=0 to 1, which is -0? -(1-1)=0 to 1.

General: x from -n +1 to n? For n=1: -1+1=0 to 1, yes.

But in our case, starts at x= -22? -n +1 = -23 +1 = -22.

To x=n=23.

Number of cells: from x= -22 to x=23 inclusive.

Values: -22,-21,...,0,...,23.

Number: 23 - (-22) +1=23+22+1=46, good.

Numbers: starts at (-22,-23)? After first move: from (-23,-23) to (-22,-23), so (-22,-23) is number 2164.

Then (-21,-23)=2165, etc.

Up to (23,-23)=?

At (x,-23), x increasing from -22 to 23.

Set k=0 at x= -22, num=2164.

Then num=2164 + k, x= -22 + k.

So num=2164 + k, k=x - (-22)=x+22.

Thus num=2164 + (x +22) = 2186 + x.

At x= -22, num=2186 -22=2164, yes.

At x=0, num=2186.

At x=23, num=2186 +23=2209.

Which matches the end of ring, since (2n+1)^2=47^2=2209.

Now, back to the problem: we need the neighbors of 2026.

2026 is the first number in the ring, at (23,-22).

Now, what are its eight neighbors? The adjacent cells: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

So position (23,-22).

Neighbors:

- Right: (24,-22)? But is it occupied? The ring is only up to max |x|,|y|=23? Currently, since it's the start, and the spiral is only filled up to ring n=22? Ring n=23 is just starting.

The inner rings are filled, but outer rings are not yet.

Specifically, for cell (x,y), its neighbors are adjacent cells, but some may not be filled yet, but in this case, since 2026 is the first number in ring 23, the numbers before it are in inner rings, so all neighbors should be filled only if they are in inner rings or same ring, but same ring just started.

Specifically, at (23,-22), which is on the right side.

Its neighbors:

- Up: (23,-21)

- Down: (23,-23)? But y=-23, which is below.

- Left: (22,-22)

- Right: (24,-22) — but this is outside, not filled yet.

- Diagonals: (24,-21), (24,-23), (22,-21), (22,-23)

But right and diagonals involving right are not filled, since ring 23 is just starting, and ring 24 is not yet.

Similarly, down: (23,-23), is it filled? In ring 23, but later.

But since we are at the beginning, only some neighbors are filled.

Specifically, the neighbors that are already present in the spiral before 2026.

Since 2026 is placed at step 2026, its neighbors must have been placed earlier if they are smaller numbers.

So, we need to find which neighbors exist and have numbers less than 2026.

The cells adjacent to (23,-22):

List:

1. Up: (23,-21)

2. Down: (23,-23)

3. Left: (22,-22)

4. Right: (24,-22)

5. Up-left: (22,-21)

6. Up-right: (24,-21)

7. Down-left: (22,-23)

8. Down-right: (24,-23)

Now, which of these are already occupied when placing 2026? That is, which have numbers <2026.

Since the spiral fills from center outward, and ring by ring, a cell is filled when its ring is reached.

The ring of a cell (x,y) is max(|x|,|y|), since it's in ring n where n = max(|x|,|y|).

For example, (23,-22): |x|=23, |y|=22, max=23, so ring 23.

Similarly, (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23, ring 23.

(23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23, ring 23.

(22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22, ring 22.

(24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24, ring 24.

Similarly, others.

Now, ring n is filled after all rings <n are filled.

Specifically, ring n starts at number (2n-1)^2 +1.

For ring 22: starts at (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850.

Ends at (2*22+1)^2=45^2=2025.

For ring 23: starts at 2026, ends at 47^2=2209.

Now, for a cell in ring n, it is filled when the spiral reaches it, which is during the filling of ring n.

But for neighbors of (23,-22), which is in ring 23, but since it's the first cell, all neighbors in ring 23 are not yet filled, except possibly if they are filled earlier, but in ring 23, it starts at (23,-22), so no cell in ring 23 is filled before it.

Cells in lower rings are filled earlier.

Specifically:

- Cells with max(|x|,|y|) < 23, i.e., ring <=22, are filled by number <=2025.

- Cells with max(|x|,|y|) =23, i.e., ring 23, are filled from 2026 onwards, so at step 2026, only (23,-22) is filled in ring 23, others are not yet.

- Cells with max(|x|,|y|) >23, i.e., ring >=24, are not yet filled, since ring 23 is just starting.

Therefore, for the neighbors:

- (23,-21): max(|23|,| -21|)=max(23,21)=23, ring 23, not filled yet (since only first cell is filled).

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23, ring 23, not filled yet.

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22, ring 22, filled earlier, number <=2025.

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24, ring 24, not filled yet.

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22, ring 22, filled.

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24, ring 24, not filled.

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23? |y|=23, |x|=22, max=23, ring 23, not filled.

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24, ring 24, not filled.

So, only the neighbors that are in ring 22 or lower are filled.

Specifically:

- Left: (22,-22)

- Up-left: (22,-21)

- And possibly others? Down-left: (22,-23) is ring 23, not filled.

Up: ring 23, not filled.

Down: ring 23, not filled.

Right: ring 24, not filled.

Diagonals: only up-left is ring 22, others are higher or same ring.

So only two neighbors are filled: left and up-left.

That is, (22,-22) and (22,-21).

But eight neighbors, but only two are present? That seems too few, but logically, since it's the start of the ring, and on the side, so only the left and up-left should be from inner ring.

But let me confirm with a smaller example.

Suppose we take number 2, which is at (1,0), first of ring n=1.

Neighbors: up (1,1), down (1,-1), left (0,0), right (2,0), diagonals: (0,1),(0,-1),(2,1),(2,-1).

Now, ring: (1,0): max(1,0)=1, ring1.

(1,1): max(1,1)=1, ring1.

(1,-1): ring1.

(0,0): max(0,0)=0, ring0.

(2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring2.

Others similar.

At step 2, when placing 2, what is filled: center (0,0)=1 is filled. Others in ring1 not yet.

So neighbors: (0,0)=1 is filled, others not.

Specifically: left: (0,0)=1.

Up: (1,1) not filled yet (filled at step 3).

Down: (1,-1) filled at step 7? Later.

Right: (2,0) filled at step 10? Much later.

Diagonals: (0,1) filled at step 4, (0,-1) at step 8, etc.

So only one neighbor: left, which is (0,0)=1.

But according to the problem, for 2026, I have two neighbors: left and up-left.

In this case for 2, only one neighbor.

But in my calculation for 2026, I have two: (22,-22) and (22,-21).

But for n=1, at (1,0), up-left would be (0,-1)? Diagonally: up-left is (0,1)? Let's see.

Position (1,0). Neighbors:

- Up: (1,1)

- Down: (1,-1)

- Left: (0,0)

- Right: (2,0)

- Up-left: (0,1) — northwest

- Up-right: (2,1) — northeast

- Down-left: (0,-1) — southwest

- Down-right: (2,-1) — southeast

At step 2, only (0,0)=1 is filled. (0,1) is filled at step 4, (0,-1) at step 8, etc. So indeed only one neighbor filled.

But for 2026 at (23,-22), I thought (22,-21) is up-left, which is ring 22, so should be filled.

But in n=1 case, (0,1) is up-left from (1,0), and it is ring max(0,1)=1, same ring, not filled yet.

Ah! I see! For (23,-22), up-left is (22,-21).

Now, |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22? 22>21, so max=22, ring 22.

Earlier I said max(22,21)=22, yes, ring 22.

But in n=1 case, from (1,0), up-left is (0,1), max(|0|,|1|)=1, same as current ring 1, so not filled yet.

But for (23,-22), ring 23, (22,-21) has max(22,21)=22 <23, so ring 22, filled earlier.

Similarly, left is (22,-22), max(22,22)=22<23, ring 22.

Now, is there down-left? (22,-23), max(22,23)=23, same ring, not filled.

So only left and up-left.

But in n=1, why no up-left? Because for (1,0), (0,1) is same ring.

But for (23,-22), (22,-21) is lower ring.

So depends on the position.

Now, for 2026, at (23,-22), neighbors in lower rings: left (22,-22) ring 22, and up-left (22,-21) ring 22? max(22,21)=22, yes.

Is there any other? Down-left: (22,-23), but max(22,23)=23, same ring.

What about directly above? (23,-21), same ring.

But what about down? (23,-23), same ring.

But is there a neighbor below? (23,-23) is same ring, not filled.

But perhaps diagonally down-left, but same ring.

But what about the cell below? (23,-23), but also, is there a cell at (23,-23)? Yes.

But not filled.

Now, another neighbor: since it's on the "side", but perhaps there is a neighbor from inner ring diagonally or something.

For example, is (24,-22) but ring 24, not filled.

But also, directly left is (22,-22), which is ring 22.

Now, is there a neighbor at (23,-22) with y lower? Down is (23,-23), same ring.

But what about (22,-22) and (22,-21), both ring 22.

Now, is (21,-22) or something? No, not adjacent.

Adjacent cells are only those eight.

Now, another one: down-left is (22,-23), but as said, ring 23.

Similarly, up-right is (24,-21), ring 24.

So only two neighbors: left and up-left.

But for a number in the middle, it should have more, but here it's at the start.

But let me confirm with another example.

Take number 10, which is the start of ring n=2, at (2,-1).

Neighbors:

- Up: (2,0)

- Down: (2,-2)

- Left: (1,-1)

- Right: (3,-1)

- Up-left: (1,0)

- Up-right: (3,0)

- Down-left: (1,-2)

- Down-right: (3,-2)

Now, ring: (2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ring2.

At step 10, when placing 10, what is filled: rings 0 and 1 are filled, i.e., numbers 1 to 9.

Ring 2 starts at 10.

So neighbors:

- (2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring2, not filled yet.

- (2,-2): max(2,2)=2, ring2, not filled.

- (1,-1): max(1,1)=1, ring1, filled (it's number 8? Positions: earlier, (1,-1)=9? For n=1, (1,-1)=9.

But at step 10, 9 is filled, yes.

- (3,-1): max(3,1)=3, ring3, not filled.

- (1,0): max(1,0)=1, ring1, filled (number 2? (1,0)=2)

- (3,0): ring3, not.

- (1,-2): max(1,2)=2, ring2, not filled yet.

- (3,-2): ring3, not.

So filled neighbors: left (1,-1)=9? And up-left (1,0)=2.

Same as before: left and up-left.

(1,-1) is left? From (2,-1), left is (1,-1), yes.

Up-left: (1,0)? Up would be (2,0), left is (1,-1), so up-left is (1,0), yes.

Numbers: (1,-1)=9, (1,0)=2.

Both filled.

So yes, for the start of a ring, at (n,1-n), neighbors filled are left: (n-1,1-n) and up-left: (n-1,1-n +1) = (n-1,2-n).

In this case, for n=23, position (23,-22)

Left: (22,-22)

Up-left: (22,-21)  [since y increases by 1]

Now, both are in ring 22, since max(|x|,|y|) <=22? |x|=22, |y|=22 or 21, both max=22, ring 22.

Now, I need to find the numbers at these positions: (22,-22) and (22,-21).

Since they are in ring 22, which is filled before ring 23, so numbers less than 2026.

Now, ring 22: from (2*22-1)^2 +1 =43^2 +1=1849+1=1850 to 45^2=2025.

Now, I need the exact positions.

So, for a cell in ring n=22, what is its number.

To find the number at (22,-22) and (22,-21).

Ring n=22 starts at (22,1-22)=(22,-21) with number 1850.

Interesting! The start of ring 22 is at (22,-21), which is exactly one of the neighbors: up-left neighbor of our cell.

Our cell is (23,-22), up-left is (22,-21), which is the start of ring 22.

Similarly, left is (22,-22).

Now, ring 22 starts at (22,-21)=1850.

Then it moves up first, since same as before.

So, for ring 22, start at (22,-21)=1850.

Move up along x=22, y from -21 to ? y_max=22? Since n=22.

y from 1-n=1-22=-21 to n=22.

So y=-21 to 22.

Number: 22 - (-21) +1=22+21+1=44, and 2n=44, yes.

Numbers: at (22,y), num=1850 + (y - (-21)) =1850 + y +21.

Since similar to before.

At y=y, num=1850 + (y +21)

Set k=y - (-21)=y+21, num=1850 + k.

At y=-21, k=0, num=1850.

At y=22, num=1850 + (22+21)=1850+43=1893.

Now, our neighbors: first, (22,-21): this is the start, so number 1850.

Second, (22,-22): what is this?

Now, (22,-22) is in ring 22, but not the start.

y=-22, but in the up segment, y ranges from -21 to 22, so y=-22 is not in this segment? But it must be in the ring.

y=-22, which is below.

In the up segment, y starts at -21 and goes up to 22, so y=-22 is not included.

But (22,-22) should be in ring 22, since max(22,22)=22.

Where is it in the path?

After the up segment, it moves left, down, right.

But (22,-22) is on the bottom side? Since y=-22, which is y= -n = -22.

In the last segment, it moves right along y= -n = -22.

But let's see the path.

Start at (22,-21)=1850.

Move up to (22,-20),1851, ..., up to (22,22)=1893? As above.

Then move left along y=22, to (21,22), (20,22), ..., down to (-22,22)? But as before, starts at (22,22), moves left to (21,22), etc., to (-22,22).

New cells: x from 21 down to -22, y=22.

Number: at (x,22), starts at (21,22)=1894? After (22,22)=1893, next is (21,22)=1894.

Then (20,22)=1895, ..., to (-22,22)=?

Num=1894 + (21 - x) ? Since k=21-x, num=1894 + k.

At x=21, num=1894.

x=20,1895.

...

x=-22, num=1894 + (21 - (-22)) =1894 + 21+22=1894+43=1937.

Then next segment: move down along x=-22, y from 22 to ? Starts at (-22,22)=1937, moves down to (-22,21)=1938, ..., to (-22,-22)=?

y from 21 down to -22? New cells y=21 to -22.

At (x,y)=(-22,y), y decreasing.

Starts at (-22,21)=1938? After (-22,22)=1937, next is (-22,21)=1938.

Then to (-22,20), etc., down to (-22,-22)=?

Num=1938 + (21 - y) ? At y=21, num=1938.

y=20,1939.

...

y=-22, num=1938 + (21 - (-22)) =1938 + 21+22=1938+43=1981.

Then last segment: move right along y=-22, from x=-22 to x=22? But starts at (-22,-22)=1981, moves right to (-21,-22)=1982, ..., to (22,-22)=?

New cells: x from -21 to 22? Since starts at x=-21? After (-22,-22), moves to (-21,-22), so (-21,-22)=1982.

Then (-20,-22)=1983, ..., to (22,-22)=?

x from -21 to 22.

Num=1982 + (x - (-21)) =1982 + x +21 =2003 + x.

At x=-21, num=2003 -21=1982.

x=0, num=2003.

x=22, num=2003+22=2025.

Which is the end, since 45^2=2025.

Now, our neighbors: (22,-21) and (22,-22).

(22,-21): this is the start of ring 22, so number 1850.

(22,-22): this is in the last segment, along y=-22.

Specifically, at (22,-22), which is the end of the ring.

From above, in the right segment along y=-22, at x=22, num=2003 + x =2003+22=2025.

Since it's the last cell of ring 22.

So number 2025.

Now, so neighbors of 2026 are:

- Left: (22,-22) = 2025

- Up-left: (22,-21) = 1850

Sum is 2025 + 1850.

But is that all? Only two neighbors? But the problem asks for sum of all eight neighbors, but only two are filled? But perhaps others are filled, but in this case, only these two.

But earlier for number 2, only one neighbor, but here two.

But the problem says "all 8 neighbors", implying that in the infinite grid, but only the filled ones are considered? But typically, neighbors mean adjacent cells, and if not present, perhaps not included, but the sum should include only existing neighbors with numbers.

But in this case, only two neighbors are present and have numbers.

But let me confirm for a number not at start.

Say, take number 3, at (1,1).

Neighbors: all eight directions.

At step 3, what is filled: center (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3 just placed.

So neighbors: (0,0)=1, (1,0)=2, (0,1) not yet, (2,1) not, (1,2) not, (0,2) not, (2,0) not, (2,2) not, etc.

So filled neighbors: down (1,0)=2, and down-left? Down-left is (0,0)? From (1,1), down is (1,0), left is (0,1), down-left is (0,0).

So (0,0)=1 and (1,0)=2.

So two neighbors: down and down-left? Down is directly below, down-left is diagonal.

In this case, similar.

But for center, more.

But in our case, for 2026, we have left and up-left.

Now sum is 2025 + 1850 = 3875.

But is this correct? But the problem is to find sum of neighbors, and only two are present, so sum is 2025 + 1850.

But let me write down: 2025 + 1850.

2025 + 1800 = 3825, plus 50 = 3875.

But is there any other neighbor? Earlier I thought only these two, but let me double-check.

Position (23,-22).

Neighbors:

- N: (23,-21) — same ring, not filled

- NE: (24,-21) — ring 24, not filled

- E: (24,-22) — ring 24, not filled

- SE: (24,-23) — ring 24, not filled

- S: (23,-23) — same ring, not filled

- SW: (22,-23) — same ring, not filled (since ring 23, max=23)

- W: (22,-22) — ring 22, filled, 2025

- NW: (22,-21) — ring 22, filled, 1850

So yes, only west and northwest are filled.

So sum is 1850 + 2025.

But 1850 is the start of ring 22, 2025 is the end of ring 22.

Now, numerically, 1850 + 2025 = 3875.

But is this correct? In the smaller example, for number 10 at (2,-1), neighbors: left (1,-1)=9, up-left (1,0)=2, sum=11.

Now, what are the actual neighbors? But at that time, only these two are filled, but later others are filled, but the neighbors are the adjacent cells, regardless of when filled, but the sum is of the numbers in those cells, so when we consider the neighbors, we need the numbers that are eventually placed there, not necessarily at the time.

Ah! Important point!

The problem is: "the sum of all 8 neighbors" — meaning, in the completed spiral, what are the numbers in the eight adjacent cells to 2026.

Not which are filled at the time, but what numbers are there eventually.

I think I misunderstood.

In the infinite spiral, all neighbors exist and have numbers, since the spiral fills all grid cells.

So for any cell, all eight adjacent cells are occupied by some number.

So for 2026 at (23,-22), the eight neighbors are as listed, and each has a number assigned in the spiral.

We need to find those numbers and sum them.

In this case, some neighbors are in the same ring, some in inner, some in outer rings.

Specifically:

- North: (23,-21) — same ring, ring 23

- Northeast: (24,-21) — ring 24

- East: (24,-22) — ring 24

- Southeast: (24,-23) — ring 24

- South: (23,-23) — same ring, ring 23

- Southwest: (22,-23) — same ring, ring 23? max(22,23)=23, yes

- West: (22,-22) — ring 22

- Northwest: (22,-21) — ring 22

So, we have:

- Two neighbors in ring 22: west and northwest: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

- Four neighbors in ring 23: north, south, southwest, and? north (23,-21), south (23,-23), southwest (22,-23), and what else? southeast is ring 24, northeast ring 24, east ring 24.

In ring 23: north (23,-21), south (23,-23), southwest (22,-23), and northwest is ring 22, west is ring 22.

Missing one? The neighbors in ring 23 should be: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23), and also (24,-22)? But (24,-22) is ring 24.

List:

- (23,-21): ring 23

- (23,-23): ring 23

- (22,-23): ring 23 (since max(22,23)=23)

- And (24,-22)? max(24,22)=24, ring 24

But what about (22,-22)? ring 22

(22,-21): ring 22

(24,-21): ring 24

(24,-23): ring 24

So only three neighbors in ring 23? But should be more? No, because the cell is on the edge.

Specifically, (23,-22) has neighbors:

- Same x: (23,-21) and (23,-23) both ring 23

- Same y? No, but diagonally.

The southwest is (22,-23), which is ring 23.

But is there a neighbor at (24,-22)? Ring 24.

Or (22,-22) ring 22.

So indeed, neighbors in ring 23: north (23,-21), south (23,-23), and southwest (22,-23). But southwest is diagonal, but also, is there southeast? (24,-23) ring 24.

And northwest and northeast are ring 22 and 24.

But what about directly west? (22,-22) ring 22, not same ring.

So only three neighbors in ring 23? But ring 23 has many cells, but for this position, yes.

We also have neighbors in ring 24: northeast (24,-21), east (24,-22), southeast (24,-23)

And in ring 22: west (22,-22) and northwest (22,-21)

So total: ring 22: two neighbors

Ring 23: three neighbors? north, south, southwest

But southwest is (22,-23), which is ring 23.

Is there a fourth? For example, if it were interior, but here it's on the boundary.

List explicitly:

1. N: (23,-21) — ring 23

2. NE: (24,-21) — ring 24

3. E: (24,-22) — ring 24

4. SE: (24,-23) — ring 24

5. S: (23,-23) — ring 23

6. SW: (22,-23) — ring 23

7. W: (22,-22) — ring 22

8. NW: (22,-21) — ring 22

So, ring 22: W and NW

Ring 23: N, S, SW

Ring 24: NE, E, SE

Three in ring 23, three in ring 24, two in ring 22.

Now, we need to find the numbers at each of these positions.

We already have the two in ring 22: (22,-21)=1850, (22,-22)=2025.

Now, for ring 23 neighbors: (23,-21), (23,-23), (22,-23)

And for ring 24: (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

Now, since ring 23 is filled after ring 22, and ring 24 after ring 23, but we need their numbers.

So we need to find the position in the spiral for each of these cells.

First, let's handle the ring 23 neighbors.

Ring 23 starts at (23,-22)=2026.

Now, the path: first segment: move up along x=23, y from -22 to 23.

So positions: (23,y) for y=-22,-21,-20,...,23.

Numbers: as before, num = 2026 + (y - (-22)) = 2026 + y + 22

At y=-22: 2026

y=-21: 2027

...

Now, we need (23,-21): y=-21

Num = 2026 + (-21) + 22 = 2026 +1 = 2027

2026 + y + 22, y=-21, so 2026 -21 +22=2026+1=2027.

Similarly, (23,-23): but y=-23 is not in this segment, because y starts at -22 and goes up to 23, so y=-23 is not included in up segment.

Where is (23,-23)? It should be in the down segment or something.

Later in the path.

After up segment, it moves left, then down, then right.

Specifically, after reaching (23,23), it moves left along y=23 to x=-23.

Then down along x=-23 to y=-23.

Then right along y=-23 to x=23.

Now, (23,-23) is on the bottom side, so in the right segment along y=-23.

Similarly, (22,-23) is also on that side or adjacent.

First, let's find (23,-23).

This is at the end of the ring, since it's the last cell? Ring ends at (23,-23)? Earlier for ring n, it ends at (n,-n).

For n=23, ends at (23,-23).

In the last segment, moving right along y=-23, from x=-23 to x=23.

Starts at (-23,-23), then to (-22,-23), ..., to (23,-23).

The last cell is (23,-23).

Now, what number is it? Since it's the end of ring, number is (2n+1)^2 =47^2=2209.

But let's confirm.

From earlier general formula.

In the right segment of ring n, along y=-n, x from -n+1 to n.

Num = start_num + (x - (-n+1)) 

Start of segment: after moving down to (-n,-n), then moves to (-n+1,-n), which is the first new cell.

In ring 23, after down segment, ends at (-23,-23).

Then moves right to (-22,-23), which is the first of the right segment.

Number at (-22,-23): since the segment starts there.

What is the number at the start of the segment.

The ring starts at 2026.

Total cells: 8n=8*23=184.

So ends at 2026+183=2209? 2026+183=2209, yes.

The segments: each has 2n=46 cells.

First segment (up): cells 1 to 46: 2026 to 2026+45=2071? Earlier calculation: at (23,23)=2071.

2026 to 2071 is 46 cells? 2071-2026+1=46, yes.

Second segment (left): starts at (22,23)? After (23,23), moves to (22,23), so (22,23) is next, number 2072.

Ends at (-23,23)? Earlier for n=23, at (-23,23)=2072 + (22 - (-23))? Earlier for left segment: num = 2072 + (22 - x) ? Since at x=22, num=2072, x decreases.

At x=x, num=2072 + (22 - x)

At x=-23, num=2072 + (22 - (-23)) =2072 + 22+23=2072+45=2117.

Number of cells: 46, 2072 to 2117 is 2117-2072+1=46, yes.

Third segment (down): along x=-23, y from 22 down to -23? Starts at (-23,22)? After (-23,23)=2117, moves to (-23,22)=2118.

Ends at (-23,-23)=2118 + (22 - y) ? At y=y, num=2118 + (22 - y)

At y=-23, num=2118 + (22 - (-23)) =2118 + 22+23=2118+45=2163.

Last segment (right): along y=-23, x from -22 to 23? Starts at (-22,-23)=2164? After (-23,-23)=2163, moves to (-22,-23)=2164.

Then to (-21,-23), etc., to (23,-23).

At (x,-23), num=2164 + (x - (-22)) =2164 + x +22 = 2186 + x

At x=23, num=2186+23=2209, yes.

Now, we need (23,-23): this is at the end, num=2209.

But also (22,-23): this is also in this segment.

At x=22, y=-23, num=2186 + x =2186 +22=2208.

Now, also we need (23,-21): which is in the first segment.

At (23,y) with y=-21, num=2026 + y +22 =2026 -21 +22=2027.

Earlier I said 2027.

Now, so ring 23 neighbors:

- N: (23,-21) = 2027

- S: (23,-23) = 2209

- SW: (22,-23) = 2208

Now, sum so far: but we need all.

Now, ring 24 neighbors: (24,-21), (24,-22), (24,-23)

Ring 24: n=24, starts at (24,1-24)=(24,-23) with number (2*24-1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

Now, it moves up first along x=24, y from -23 to 24.

Numbers: at (24,y), num=2210 + (y - (-23)) =2210 + y +23

We need:

- NE: (24,-21) — y=-21

Num=2210 + (-21) +23 =2210 +2=2212

- E: (24,-22) — y=-22

Num=2210 + (-22) +23 =2210 +1=2211

- SE: (24,-23) — y=-23

Num=2210 + (-23) +23 =2210 +0=2210

Now, so we have all eight neighbors:

List:

1. N: (23,-21) = 2027

2. NE: (24,-21) = 2212

3. E: (24,-22) = 2211

4. SE: (24,-23) = 2210

5. S: (23,-23) = 2209

6. SW: (22,-23) = 2208

7. W: (22,-22) = 2025

8. NW: (22,-21) = 1850

Now, sum all these numbers.

List them:

2027, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2209, 2208, 2025, 1850.

Notice that many are consecutive.

Group them.

First, the ring 22 neighbors: 1850 and 2025.

Ring 23: 2027, 2209, 2208

Ring 24: 2212, 2211, 2210

Now, compute sum.

Add sequentially.

Start with 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Then +2027 = 3875 + 2027 = 5902

Better to add in pairs.

Notice that the ring 24 neighbors: 2210, 2211, 2212 — consecutive numbers.

Sum = 2210 + 2211 + 2212.

Since consecutive, average 2211, sum=2211*3=6633.

2210+2212=4422, plus 2211=4422+2211=6633, yes.

Ring 23 neighbors: 2027, 2208, 2209.

Not consecutive.

2027, 2208, 2209.

Sum: 2027 + 2208 + 2209.

Note that 2208 + 2209 = 4417, plus 2027=4417+2027=6444.

2027 + 2209 = 4236, plus 2208=4236+2208=6444.

Ring 22: 1850 + 2025 = 3875.

Now, total sum: ring22 + ring23 + ring24 sums: 3875 + 6444 + 6633.

First, 3875 + 6444.

3875 + 6400 = 10275, plus 44=10319? Better: 3875 + 6444.

3000+6000=9000, 875+444=1319, total 9000+1319=10319.

Then +6633: 10319 + 6633.

10319 + 6000=16319, +633=16319+600=16919, +33=16952.

10319 + 6633.

Add: 10319 + 6600=16919, +33=16952.

Now, so sum is 16952.

But let me verify with the list.

List all:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Add them step by step.

First, pair them:

1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417? 2208+2209=4417.

But I have eight numbers, so four pairs.

But I paired differently.

List in order:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Add sequentially:

Start with 1850

+2025 = 3875

+2027 = 5902

+2208 = 8110

+2209 = 10319

+2210 = 12529

+2211 = 14740

+2212 = 16952.

Same as before.

Notice that the numbers are symmetric or something, but anyway.

So sum is 16952.

But is this correct? In the list, we have 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

All distinct, and make sense.

To confirm, for a smaller number.

Say, for number 2 at (1,0).

Neighbors:

N: (1,1)=3

NE: (2,1)=10? Later

E: (2,0)=11? 

SE: (2,-1)=10? 

S: (1,-1)=9? 

SW: (0,-1)=8

W: (0,0)=1

NW: (0,1)=4

So numbers: 3,10,11,10? SE is (2,-1), which is 10? Positions: (1,-1)=9? Earlier.

(1,0)=2

N: (1,1)=3

NE: (2,1)=? In ring n=2, (2,1): ring starts at (2,-1)=10, then up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12? Earlier for n=2.

From earlier: (2,-1)=10, (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, etc.

E: (2,0)=11

SE: (2,-1)=10? (2,-1) is southeast? From (1,0), southeast is (2,-1)? x+1,y-1, yes (2,-1)

S: (1,-1)=9? (1,-1) is south, y decreases.

SW: (0,-1)=8? (0,-1) is southwest? x-1,y-1.

W: (0,0)=1

NW: (0,1)=4

So neighbors: N:3, NE:12? (2,1)=12, E:11, SE:10, S:9, SW:8, W:1, NW:4.

Sum: 3+12+11+10+9+8+1+4.

Calculate: 3+12=15, +11=26, +10=36, +9=45, +8=53, +1=54, +4=58.

Now, according to our method, for number at (1,0), ring n=1.

Neighbors:

- N: (1,1) ring1

- NE: (2,1) ring2

- E: (2,0) ring2

- SE: (2,-1) ring2

- S: (1,-1) ring1

- SW: (0,-1) ring1? max(0,1)=1

- W: (0,0) ring0

- NW: (0,1) ring1? max(0,1)=1

Now, numbers:

Ring0: W: (0,0)=1

Ring1: N: (1,1)=3? But we need to compute.

For ring1: starts at (1,0)=2? But (1,1) is later.

In ring1: cells: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

So:

N: (1,1)=3

S: (1,-1)=9

SW: (0,-1)=8

NW: (0,1)=4

W: (0,0)=1 (ring0)

Now ring2: NE: (2,1), E: (2,0), SE: (2,-1)

Ring2 starts at (2,-1)=10

Then up: (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12

So NE: (2,1)=12

E: (2,0)=11

SE: (2,-1)=10

So same as above: 3,12,11,10,9,8,1,4 sum=58.

Now, if we sum: ring0:1, ring1:3+9+8+4=24? But NW is (0,1)=4, SW is (0,-1)=8, both ring1, and N:3, S:9, so ring1 neighbors: N,S,SW,NW? But SW and NW are diagonals.

In this case, four neighbors in ring1: N,S,NW,SW? NW is northwest, SW southwest.

But west is ring0.

So neighbors in ring1: north, south, northwest, southwest: (1,1),(1,-1),(0,1),(0,-1) =3,9,4,8 sum=3+9+4+8=24.

Ring0: west (0,0)=1.

Ring2: northeast, east, southeast: (2,1),(2,0),(2,-1)=12,11,10 sum=33.

Total: 24+1+33=58, same.

Now for our case, we have:

Ring22: two neighbors: 1850 and 2025 sum=3875

Ring23: three neighbors: 2027,2209,2208 sum=2027+2208+2209=6444? Earlier 2027+2208=4235? No:

2027 + 2208 = 4235? 2000+2200=4200, 27+8=35, total 4235.

Then +2209=4235+2209=6444, yes.

Ring24: three neighbors: 2210,2211,2212 sum=6633.

Total: 3875 + 6444 = 10319; 10319 + 6633 = 16952.

As computed.

So the sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the numbers again.

For (23,-22)=2026

Neighbors:

W: (22,-22): in ring22, at end, we said 2025.

NW: (22,-21): start of ring22, 1850.

N: (23,-21): in ring23, up segment, y=-21, num=2026 + y +22=2026 -21 +22=2027.

S: (23,-23): in ring23, last cell, 2209.

SW: (22,-23): in ring23, right segment, at x=22, y=-23, num=2186 + x =2186+22=2208.

NE: (24,-21): in ring24, up segment, at (24,y), y=-21, num=2210 + y +23=2210 -21 +23=2212? 2210 +2=2212.

E: (24,-22): same, y=-22, num=2210 + (-22) +23=2210 +1=2211.

SE: (24,-23): same, y=-23, num=2210 + (-23) +23=2210 +0=2210.

All seem consistent.

Sum: 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

We can add them as:

Notice that 1850 + 2025 = 3875

Then 2027 + 2212 = 4239? Not helpful.

The last six are consecutive almost: 2208,2209,2210,2211,2212 and 2027.

But 2027 is smaller.

Group: 1850 + 2212 = 4062

2025 + 2211 = 4236

2027 + 2210 = 4237

2208 + 2209 = 4417

Now sum these: 4062 + 4236 = 8298

4237 + 4417 = 8654

Then 8298 + 8654 = 16952.

Same.

So I think it's correct.

Therefore, the sum is 16952.

But the problem is for 2026, and we got 16952, which is larger, but makes sense since neighbors include larger numbers.

Now, to box the answer.

But let me see if there is a pattern or simpler way.

Notice that for a cell on the "arm", but in this case, since it's at the start, but we calculated explicitly.

Another way: the sum of neighbors might be related to the position.

But anyway, we have the answer.

So \boxed{16952}

But let me confirm the ring starts.

Ring 22: starts at (22,-21)=1850? (2*22-1)^2 +1=43^2 +1=1849+1=1850, yes.

Ends at 45^2=2025.

Ring 23: starts at (23,-22)=2026, ends at 47^2=2209.

Ring 24: starts at (24,-23)=47^2 +1=2209+1=2210.

All good.

Numbers: correct.

Sum: 1850+2025=3875

2027+2208=4235? Earlier I had 2027+2208=4235? But in sum it's separate.

Total sum: min is 1850, max 2212, average around 2030, sum about 8*2030=16240, but we have 16952, which is higher, but since larger numbers, ok.

Compute average: sum=16952, divide by 8: 16952 / 8 = 2119.

Now, the numbers range from 1850 to 2212, average 2119 seems reasonable.

Since many are around 2200, but some smaller.

Anyway, I think it's correct.

So the sum is 16952.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at position (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (0,0) contains the number 1.

The eight neighboring positions and their corresponding numbers are:

- North (N): (23, -21) = 2027
- Northeast (NE): (24, -21) = 2212
- East (E): (24, -22) = 2211
- Southeast (SE): (24, -23) = 2210
- South (S): (23, -23) = 2209
- Southwest (SW): (22, -23) = 2208
- West (W): (22, -22) = 2025
- Northwest (NW): (22, -21) = 1850

The sum of these numbers is calculated as follows:

1850 + 2025 + 2027 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 16952.

This result is obtained by summing the numbers directly, and the positions are verified to be correct based on the spiral pattern and ring assignments (ring 22 for W and NW, ring 23 for N, S, and SW, ring 24 for NE, E, and SE).

\boxed{16952}
