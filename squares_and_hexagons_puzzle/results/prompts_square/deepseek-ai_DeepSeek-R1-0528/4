The problem involves a spiral of natural numbers on a square grid. It starts with 1 in the center, then 2 to the right, 3 above, 4 to the left, 5 above that, and so on. I need to find the sum of all eight neighbors of the number 2026.

First, I need to understand the layout of the spiral. It's a standard Ulam spiral or something similar. Let me sketch a small part.

Labeling the positions:

- Center: 1

- Right: 2

- Up: 3

- Left: 4

- Left: 5? No, after 4, it should go down. Let me recall.

Typically, it goes: start at center, move right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4, left again? No.

Standard spiral: from 1, move right to 2, then up to 3, left to 4,5? I think I'm messing up.

Let me think step by step.

Assume the center is at coordinates (0,0). So:

- (0,0) = 1

Then move right: (1,0) = 2

Then move up: (1,1) = 3

Then move left: (0,1) = 4

Then move left again? To (-1,1)? But that might be correct.

After (0,1)=4, it should go down to (0,0), but that's occupied, so probably it goes down to (0,-1).

Standard direction: after placing 1 at (0,0), go east to (1,0)=2, then north to (1,1)=3, then west to (0,1)=4, then west again to (-1,1)=5? But usually, after moving west once, it should turn south.

I recall that the spiral moves in layers. Each "ring" or "layer" around the center has a certain size.

The numbers on the diagonals are perfect squares. For example, the bottom-right corner of each layer is an odd square.

List some numbers:

- 1 at (0,0)

- Then moving right: 2 at (1,0)

- Up: 3 at (1,1)

- Left: 4 at (0,1)

- Left: 5 at (-1,1)? But then it should go down.

After 4 at (0,1), it moves down to (0,0)? Occupied, so it must move down to (-1,1)? No.

Standard is: after (0,1)=4, it moves down to (-1,1)? That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps: from (1,1)=3, left to (0,1)=4, then since it can't go left (because next would be (-1,1), but it should turn down.

I think: directions change after completing a side.

Start at center. First move: right 1 step to (1,0)=2.

Then up 1 step to (1,1)=3.

Then left 2 steps: first to (0,1)=4, then to (-1,1)=5.

Then down 2 steps: to (-1,0)=6, then to (-1,-1)=7.

Then right 3 steps: to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, (2,-1)=10? But in the example, it shows 7,8,9, so probably.

In the given example:

... 5 4 3 ...

... 6 1 2 ...

... 7 8 9 ...

So, assuming the grid is oriented with x increasing right, y increasing up.

So, row y=1: ... 5,4,3 so probably x=-1,y=1:5; x=0,y=1:4; x=1,y=1:3

Row y=0: ...6,1,2 so x=-1,y=0:6; x=0,y=0:1; x=1,y=0:2

Row y=-1: ...7,8,9 so x=-1,y=-1:7; x=0,y=-1:8; x=1,y=-1:9

But it shows dots, so there are more numbers.

For example, above y=1, there should be more. After 5, it went to (-1,1)=5, then down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, then right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, then probably up to (2,-1)? But next should be 10, but it's not shown.

After 9 at (1,-1), it should go up to (2,-1)? But that might be 10, but in spiral, after completing a layer, it goes to the next.

From 7 at (-1,-1), right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9, then since it was going right, but now it should turn up? But (2,-1) would be next, but let's see the sequence.

After 9, it should go up to (2,-1)=10? But in the example, it's not shown, but logically.

I recall that the bottom-right corner of each layer is k^2 for odd k.

Layer 0: just 1, at (0,0)

Layer 1: numbers from 2 to 9? 1 is center, then layer 1 should be 2 to 9.

2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 8 numbers, which makes sense for a ring.

The ring size increases by 8 each time? No, each ring has side length 2n+1 or something.

Define the "layer" n starting from 0.

Layer n has numbers from (2n-1)^2 +1 to (2n+1)^2? For n=0, ( -1)^2 +1=1+1=2, but center is 1, so perhaps layer n for n>=1.

Set k as the ring index.

The center is ring 0, with 1 number.

Ring 1: numbers 2 to 9, 8 numbers.

Ring 2: numbers 10 to 25? 25 is 5^2, 9 is 3^2, so from 10 to 25, that's 16 numbers.

Ring 3: 26 to 49? 7^2=49, so 24 numbers? 26 to 49 inclusive is 24 numbers.

Pattern: ring k has 8k numbers? For k=1, 8*1=8, yes. k=2, 8*2=16, yes. k=3, 24, yes. So ring k has 8k numbers.

The last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2. For k=1, (2*1+1)^2=9, yes. k=2, 25, yes. k=3,49, yes.

The first number of ring k is (2k-1)^2 +1. For k=1, (1)^2 +1=2, yes. k=2, 3^2 +1=10, yes. k=3,5^2+1=26, yes.

Now, the position of each number in the spiral.

To find the neighbors of 2026, I need to find its coordinates, then find the numbers at the adjacent positions.

So, first, find which ring 2026 is in.

That is, find k such that (2k-1)^2 < 2026 <= (2k+1)^2.

Set m = 2k+1, so m is odd, and m^2 >= 2026, and (m-2)^2 < 2026.

Since m is odd, compute sqrt(2026).

2026 is between 2025=45^2 and 46^2=2116.

45^2=2025, 46^2=2116.

2025 is 45^2, which is odd, so it should be the last number of some ring.

Set m=2k+1, then m^2 is the last number of ring k.

So, m^2 >= 2026, and (m-2)^2 < 2026.

m is odd.

45^2=2025 < 2026? 2025 < 2026, so not greater.

Next odd is 47? But 45 is odd, 45^2=2025.

2025 < 2026, so m^2 >= 2026 implies m>=47? 47^2=2209, which is larger than 2026, but is there an odd m with m^2 >=2026 and m<47? 45^2=2025<2026, so next is 47.

But (m-2)^2 should be less than 2026.

For m=47, (47-2)^2=45^2=2025<2026, good.

So ring k where m=2k+1=47, so 2k+1=47, 2k=46, k=23.

Last number of ring k is (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209.

First number is (2k-1)^2 +1 = (45)^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

Exactly 2026.

(2k-1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1=2025+1=2026.

And last number is (2k+1)^2=47^2=2209.

So 2026 is the first number of ring k=23.

Now, what is the position of the first number of a ring.

In the spiral, each ring starts at a specific point.

For ring k, it starts at which direction and position.

Typically, for ring k, it starts at the bottom-right of the ring? Or top-right?

Recall for small k.

Ring k=1: first number is 2, at (1,0). In our earlier grid, (1,0) is 2.

Ring k=2: first number is 10. Where is 10?

After ring 1 ends at 9 at (1,-1)? Earlier: (1,-1)=9? In our grid:

At y=1: x=-1:5, x=0:4, x=1:3

y=0: x=-1:6, x=0:1, x=1:2

y=-1: x=-1:7, x=0:8, x=1:9

Then ring 2 starts. After 9 at (1,-1), it moves up? To (2,-1)? Which should be 10.

Then up to (2,0)? But (2,0) might be 11? Let's see.

From (1,-1)=9, direction was right, but now it turns up. So to (1,0)? But occupied, so to (2,-1)=10? Then to (2,0)=11? Then to (2,1)=12? Then left to (1,1)=3? Occupied, so to (2,2)? This is messy.

I recall that the starting point for ring k is at (k, -(k-1)) or something.

For ring k=1: starts at (1,0)

k=2: should start at (2,-1)? Since (2,-1)=10.

In our grid, if (2,-1)=10, then (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? Then left to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, then down to (-1,1)=5? Occupied, so to (-1,0)=6? Occupied, so to (-1,-1)=7? Occupied, so to (-1,-2)=17? Then right to (0,-2)=18, (1,-2)=19, (2,-2)=20? Then up? But (2,-1)=10? Occupied, so to (3,-2)? This is getting complicated.

Note that for ring k, it starts at the point immediately to the right of the last number of the previous ring.

Last number of ring k-1 is at the bottom-right corner.

For ring k-1, last number is (2(k-1)+1)^2 = (2k-1)^2.

For example, k=2, ring k-1=1, last number 9 at (1,-1).

Immediately to the right: from (1,-1), right would be (2,-1), which is indeed where 10 is.

Similarly, for ring k=1, last number of ring 0? Ring 0 is just center 1 at (0,0). Last number is 1. Immediately to the right: (1,0), which is 2, correct.

So general rule: ring k starts at the position immediately to the right of the last number of ring k-1.

Last number of ring k-1 is at the bottom-right corner of ring k-1.

What are the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of ring m.

For ring m, the bottom-right corner is where? Since it ends there.

For ring m, it starts at (m, -(m-1))? Earlier for m=1: (1,0), but bottom-right? (1,-1) is bottom-right for ring 1? Ring 1 has points from x=-1 to 1, y=-1 to 1, but excluding center? Actually, ring m occupies all points where max(|x|,|y|) = m? For m=1, max(|x|,|y|)=1, so points like (1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1). But center (0,0) is excluded, so yes, the 8 points.

Bottom-right: assuming x right, y down? Or y up? In standard math coordinates, y up, but in grids, sometimes y down. In our earlier, y=1 is top, y=-1 is bottom? In our grid, y=1: top row, y=-1: bottom row. So y increases up, so bottom is y=-1.

Bottom-right: smallest y, largest x. So for ring m, min y? Actually, the ring extends from x=-m to m, y=-m to m, but excluding the inner part.

Specifically, for ring m, the points are those where max(|x|,|y|) = m.

For example, m=1: max(|x|,|y|)=1, so |x|=1 or |y|=1, but not both less, so yes, the 8 points.

Bottom-right: max(|x|,|y|)=1, and x>0, y<0? Since bottom is y negative? In our case, bottom is y=-1, so y negative.

Assuming y-axis positive upward, so bottom has smaller y.

So for bottom-right: largest x, smallest y.

Since max(|x|,|y|)=m, and for bottom-right, we want x positive, y negative, and since it's a corner, |x|=m and |y|=m? Not necessarily.

In the corner, yes. For example, ring m=1: bottom-right is (1,-1)? But in our grid, (1,-1)=9? For ring 1, numbers: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5, (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7, (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9. So bottom-right is (1,-1), yes.

Similarly, for ring m=2, bottom-right should be (2,-2)? And last number is there.

Earlier we said (2,-1)=10? No, if ring starts at (2,-1)=10, but for ring 2, bottom-right should be where it ends.

Ring 2: starts at (2,-1)=10, then moves up? To (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13, then left to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, then down to (-1,1)=5? Occupied, so to (-1,0)=6? Occupied, so to (-1,-1)=7? Occupied, so to (-1,-2)=17? Then right to (0,-2)=18, (1,-2)=19, (2,-2)=20? Then up? But (2,-1)=10? Occupied, so it should end at (2,-2)=20? But 25 is the last, so probably continues.

After (2,-2)=20, it moves up to (2,-1)? But that's already occupied by 10? Mistake.

I think I messed up the direction.

Standard spiral: after the start, it moves up.

Ring k starts at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1,0) since -(1-1)=0.

Then moves up: to (k, -(k-1) +1) = (1,1) for k=1? But (1,1) is 3, but after 2 should be 3, yes.

But for k=1, from (1,0)=2 to (1,1)=3.

Then left to (0,1)=4, (-1,1)=5.

Then down to (-1,0)=6, (-1,-1)=7.

Then right to (0,-1)=8, (1,-1)=9.

Ends at (1,-1).

Now for k=2, starts at (2,-1)? Since right of (1,-1) is (2,-1).

Then moves up: to (2,0)=11? But earlier I thought 10,11.

Assume (2,-1)=10.

Then up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? Then since it was going up, but now should turn left? To (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16? Then down? To (-1,1)= but occupied by 5? Problem.

After (-1,2)=16, it should go down to (-1,1), but occupied, so it must go to (-1,0)? But occupied by 6? So inconsistency.

I recall that for ring k, the side length is 2k, but number of steps per side.

In ring k, each side has length 2k? For k=1, side length: when moving, from start: up 1 step? But total numbers per side.

For ring k, there are four sides, each with 2k numbers? Total 8k numbers.

Sides: right, up, left, down? But in order.

Typically, for ring k, starting at (k, -(k-1))? For k=1: (1,0)

Then it moves up for k steps? But for k=1, up 1 step to (1,1).

Then left for 2k steps? But 2*1=2 steps: to (0,1), (-1,1).

Then down for 2k steps? To (-1,0), (-1,-1).

Then right for 2k steps? To (0,-1), (1,-1).

But for down and right, it's 2 steps each, but for up only 1? Inconsistent.

I see: when moving away from the center, the first move is shorter.

Standard is: for ring k, start at (k, k-1)? No.

From online or memory, I recall that the starting point for ring k is at (k, 1-k) or something.

Set for ring k, the bottom-right corner is at (k, -k).

For k=1, (1,-1), which is where 9 is, last number.

Then the top-right is (k,k), for k=1, (1,1)=3.

Top-left (-k,k)=(-1,1)=5.

Bottom-left (-k,-k)=(-1,-1)=7.

Now, the first number of ring k is at the bottom-right? But for k=1, first is 2 at (1,0), not (1,-1).

So not.

The first number is at the right of the bottom-right of previous ring, but previous ring's bottom-right.

For ring k, it starts at (k, -(k-1)).

For k=1: (1,0) =2, good.

k=2: (2,-1)=10, good.

Now, from there, it moves up. How many steps? For ring k, the first side (up) has length 2k? For k=1, length 2? But it moved only one step to (1,1)=3.

For k=1, up: from (1,0) to (1,1), one step.

Then left: from (1,1) to (0,1) to (-1,1), two steps.

Then down: from (-1,1) to (-1,0) to (-1,-1), two steps.

Then right: from (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1), two steps.

So the first side (up) has length 1 for k=1, but for k=2, it should be different.

For k=2, start at (2,-1)=10.

Move up: to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13? How many steps? If it moves up, to y=2, but max |y| should be 2 for ring 2.

From (2,-1) to (2,2)? But that's y from -1 to 2, but |y| max is 2, but it should go to (2,2).

But how many steps: from y=-1 to y=2, that's 3 steps? But 10 to 11,12,13, so three numbers, so two moves? From (2,-1) to (2,0) is one move, to (2,1) second, to (2,2) third, so three moves, four points? No, each move to a new number.

Start at (2,-1)=10.

After first move up: to (2,-1+1)=(2,0)=11.

Second move up: to (2,1)=12.

Then, since it's ring k=2, should it go further? To (2,2)=13.

Then turn left: to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16.

Then turn down: to (-1,1)= but occupied? Should be to (-1,2) down to (-1,1)? But (-1,1) is already 5 from previous ring. Problem.

After (-1,2)=16, down to (-1,1), but that is occupied, so it must be that for ring k, it goes to y=k, but the inner ring is at |y|<=k-1, so it should be able to go to (-1,1), but it's occupied only if k-1 >=1, which for k=2, k-1=1, and |y|=1 is occupied by ring 1.

So to avoid, it should not go to (-1,1), but directly to lower.

I think the side lengths are different.

For ring k, the first side (up) has length 2k-1? For k=1, 2*1-1=1, which matches.

Then left side has length 2k, for k=1,2, matches.

Then down side has length 2k, matches.

Then right side has length 2k, but for k=1, right side from (-1,-1) to (0,-1) to (1,-1), two steps, length 2, which is 2k=2, good.

But for the last side, it ends at the bottom-right, which is good.

Now for k=2: first side up: length 2*2 -1 =3? So from (2,-1)=10, move up 3 steps: to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13. Three moves, three new positions, so numbers 10,11,12,13? But 10 is start, then after moves: first move to 11, second to 12, third to 13, so positions: start (2,-1)=10, after first up: (2,0)=11, after second: (2,1)=12, after third: (2,2)=13. So four numbers? The moves are between, but typically we assign numbers to positions.

So positions occupied: (2,-1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) for the up side? That's four positions, but length should be the number of moves or number of cells.

In terms of cells, each side has a certain number of cells.

For ring k, each side has 2k cells, but for the first side, since it starts at the corner, but in this case for up side, it starts at bottom-right and goes to top-right.

For k=2, bottom-right is (2,-2)? Earlier we have start at (2,-1), which is not bottom-right.

To clarify, for ring k, the starting point is not a corner; it's on the right side.

For ring k, the right side has cells from y= -(k-1) to y=k, but excluding the start or something.

From the pattern: for ring k, the first number is at (k, -(k-1)).

Then it moves up to (k, k). How many steps? From y= -(k-1) to y=k, the change in y is k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1.

So it moves up by 2k-1 steps? But each step increases y by 1, so from y= -(k-1) to y=k, delta y = k - (-(k-1)) = k + k -1 = 2k-1, so it moves 2k-1 steps in y-direction, but since it starts at a cell, after m moves, it is at new cell.

Start at cell A. After first move up, to cell B above it, and so on.

So if it moves m times, it visits m+1 cells.

From y_start = -(k-1) to y_end = k, and since it moves to higher y, and ends at y=k, starts at y= -(k-1), and each move increases y by 1, so the number of moves is [k - (-(k-1))] = 2k-1.

Thus number of cells on this side is number of moves +1 = (2k-1) +1 = 2k.

Moves: from start to end, if it moves n times, it visits n+1 cells.

The y-coordinates range from -(k-1) to k, inclusive.

The values are integers, so number of integers from -(k-1) to k inclusive is [k - (-(k-1))] + 1 = [k + k -1] +1 = 2k-1 +1 = 2k.

Yes, so for the up side, there are 2k cells: from (k, -(k-1)) to (k, k).

For k=1: from (1,0) to (1,1), so cells (1,0) and (1,1), numbers 2 and 3. Yes, two cells.

For k=2: from (2,-1) to (2,2), so y from -1 to 2, cells (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2), numbers 10,11,12,13. But earlier we thought 10 to 13, but is that correct? We need to assign numbers.

After this, it turns left and moves to west.

To (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), etc.

Now, the left side: it moves left to x= -k.

Start at (k,k) = (2,2) for k=2.

Move left: to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2). Then should it go to (-2,2)? But for k=2, max |x| should be 2, so yes.

But how many cells? From x=k to x=-k, y=k fixed.

x from k to -k inclusive, delta x = -k - k = -2k, but number of cells: from x=k to x=-k, inclusive, number is |k - (-k)| +1 = 2k +1? But for k=1, from (1,1) to (-1,1), cells (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), three cells, but earlier for k=1, we had only two moves? In k=1, after (1,1)=3, left to (0,1)=4, then to (-1,1)=5, so three cells? But earlier I said for k=1 left side has two steps, but actually cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1), three cells.

But total for ring k=1 should be 8 cells, but if up side has 2, left has 3, then down and right must have less.

Inconsistency.

For k=1: cells:

Up side: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3 — two cells.

Then left side: from (1,1) to (-1,1), but (1,1) is already included? When moving, it starts from the last point.

After being at (1,1), it moves left to (0,1), then to (-1,1). So new cells: (0,1) and (-1,1), so two new cells? But (1,1) is already counted in previous side.

In terms of the path, each cell is visited once, so the sides are disjoint except for the corners which are shared.

For ring k, the four corners are shared between sides.

The up side includes the bottom-right corner and the top-right corner.

For k=1: up side: (1,0) and (1,1) — but (1,0) is bottom-right? In our grid, y=0 is middle, y=-1 bottom, so (1,0) is not bottom-right; bottom-right is (1,-1).

So perhaps the sides are defined differently.

For the up side, it starts at (k, -(k-1)) and ends at (k,k), and includes both.

For k=1: (1,0) and (1,1), but that's only two cells, but the side should include the cells in between, but there are no cells in between since y changes by 1.

Number of cells is 2, as above.

Then left side: starts at (k,k) = (1,1), and moves to (-k,k) = (-1,1).

Cells: (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1). But (1,1) is already included in up side, so if we include it again, it's double-counting.

In the spiral path, the corners are visited only once, but when defining sides, each side includes its starting corner.

To avoid double-counting, each side includes the starting cell but not the ending cell, or vice versa.

For the path, the number of cells is fixed, so the sides must cover all cells without overlap.

For ring k, there are 8k cells.

The up side has cells with x=k, y from -(k-1) to k inclusive.

For k=1: y from 0 to 1, cells (1,0),(1,1) — two cells.

Then left side: x from k to -k, y=k, but since x=k is already included, so from x=k-1 down to x= -k? Or from x=k to x= -k, but exclude x=k if already counted.

Typically, the left side starts at (k,k) and goes to (-k,k), but since (k,k) is already in up side, we start from there and move to (-k,k), so for k=1, from (1,1) to (-1,1), cells visited: (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1) — but (1,1) is already counted, so if we list the cells for the side, it should be the new cells added.

In the path, when it moves, it adds new cells.

For ring k, start at (k, -(k-1)) — new cell.

Then move up: each move up adds a new cell at (k, y+1) for y from -(k-1) to k-1, so it moves up 2k-1 times? Let's calculate the number of moves.

From start at (k, -(k-1)) , move up to (k, -(k-1)+1) = (k, -k+2), then to (k, -k+3), ..., up to (k, k).

The y-coordinate starts at y_s = -(k-1), ends at y_e = k.

The sequence of y: y_s, y_s+1, y_s+2, ..., y_e.

Number of cells: from y_s to y_e inclusive, which is y_e - y_s +1 = k - (-(k-1)) +1 = k + k -1 +1 = 2k.

Yes, 2k cells for the up side.

For k=1: 2*1=2 cells: (1,0),(1,1).

For k=2: 4 cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2).

Then, at (k,k) = (2,2), it turns left and moves west.

It moves to (k-1,k), (k-2,k), ..., down to (-k,k).

Start at (2,2), move left to (1,2), (0,2), (-1,2), (-2,2).

Number of cells: from x=2 to x= -2, y=2 fixed, inclusive, number is |2 - (-2)| +1 = 4+1=5, but for k=2, should be less.

The x-coordinate from k to -k inclusive, but since it starts at x=k, ends at x= -k, and each move decreases x by 1, so number of cells is (k - (-k)) +1 = 2k+1.

For k=1: 2*1+1=3 cells: (1,1),(0,1),(-1,1) — but this is 3 cells, but for ring k=1, total cells are 8, if up side has 2, left side has 3, then already 5, but there are more.

And (1,1) is included in both if we include it, but in the path, it's only once.

The problem is that the corner (k,k) is the end of up side and start of left side, so when we say "left side", it should start from (k,k) and go to (-k,k), but (k,k) is already counted in up side, so for the left side, the new cells are from (k-1,k) to (-k,k).

For k=1: new cells for left side: from (0,1) to (-1,1), so only (0,1) and (-1,1), two cells.

Then total so far: up side 2 cells, left side 2 cells, total 4.

Then down side: from (-k,k) = (-1,1) for k=1, move down to (-1,0), (-1,-1).

New cells: from (-1,0) to (-1,-1)? But (-1,1) is already counted, so new cells: (-1,0), (-1,-1), two cells.

Then right side: from (-1,-1) move right to (0,-1), (1,-1).

New cells: (0,-1), (1,-1), two cells.

Total 2+2+2+2=8, good.

For k=2: start at (2,-1) =10.

Up side: move up to (2,0)=11, (2,1)=12, (2,2)=13. Cells: (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2) — 4 cells, as 2k=4.

At (2,2), turn left, move to (1,2)=14, (0,2)=15, (-1,2)=16, (-2,2)=17. New cells: since (2,2) is already counted, so (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2) — 4 cells? But 2k=4 for k=2.

Number should be 2k for each side? But for k=1 it was 2 per side, for k=2 should be 4 per side? Total 16, good.

But here left side has cells from x=k-1 down to x=-k? From x=1 to x=-2, but x=1,0,-1,-2, that's 4 cells: (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2).

Yes.

Then at (-2,2), turn down, move to (-2,1), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2)? But y from 2 to -2, but should end at bottom-left.

Move down: y decreases.

From (-2,2) to (-2,1)=18? Then (-2,0)=19, (-2,-1)=20, (-2,-2)=21. New cells: since (-2,2) is already counted, so (-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2) — 4 cells.

Then at (-2,-2), turn right, move to (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2)? But start was at (2,-1), not included.

From (-2,-2) move right to (-1,-2)=22, (0,-2)=23, (1,-2)=24, (2,-2)=25? But for k=2, last number should be 25, yes.

New cells: (-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2) — 4 cells.

Total cells: up 4, left 4, down 4, right 4? 16, but ring has 16 cells, but we have 4 sides each with 4 cells, but the corners are included only once? In this case, corner (2,2) is in up side, not in left side? In left side we started from (1,2), not (2,2), so (2,2) is only in up side, (-2,2) only in left side? Left side ended at (-2,2), which is then start of down side? But in down side we started from (-2,1), not (-2,2), so (-2,2) is only in left side.

Similarly, (-2,-2) only in down side, and (2,-2) only in right side.

But what about the start point (2,-1)? It's in up side.

Now, is there any overlap? Seems no, total 16 cells.

But for the right side, we have (2,-2), but the start was (2,-1), which is different.

Now, the end is (2,-2), but for the next ring, it should start at (3,-2)? Right of (2,-2).

But in this case, for k=2, we have numbers: up:10,11,12,13; left:14,15,16,17; down:18,19,20,21; right:22,23,24,25. But earlier I thought bottom-right is (2,-2)=25? But in our initial grid, for y=-1, we had (1,-1)=9, but now for ring 2, (1,-1) is not included? Ring 2 should be outside ring 1.

Ring 1: max |x|,|y|=1, ring 2: max |x|,|y|=2.

Points: for example, (2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2),(-2,1),(-2,0),(-2,-1),(-2,-2),(-1,-2),(0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2).

Now, in this, (2,-1) is included, which is y=-1, x=2, |y|=1<2, but |x|=2, so max=2, so it is in ring 2.

Similarly, (1,-1): x=1,y=-1, max(|x|,|y|)=1, so in ring 1, which is correct, occupied by 9? In ring 1, (1,-1)=9.

In ring 2, (2,-1)=10, good.

Now, neighbors: but anyway, we have the positions.

Back to our problem.

For ring k, starts at (k, -(k-1)) = (k, 1-k) since -(k-1) = 1-k.

In our case k=23, so start at (23, 1-23) = (23, -22)

And this is the first number of the ring, which is 2026.

So 2026 is at (23, -22)

Now, we need the eight neighbors: adjacent cells, so same as Moore neighborhood: all cells that differ by at most 1 in x and y, but not itself.

So positions: (x±1,y), (x,y±1), (x±1,y±1) — all combinations.

More precisely: for a cell at (x,y), neighbors are:

- Same row: (x-1,y), (x+1,y)

- Same column: (x,y-1), (x,y+1)

- Diagonals: (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x+1,y+1)

So eight neighbors.

Now, for 2026 at (23,-22), so neighbors are:

(22,-22), (24,-22) — same y

(23,-23), (23,-21) — same x

(22,-23), (22,-21), (24,-23), (24,-21) — diagonals

Now, we need to find what numbers are at these positions.

But these positions may be in different rings, since ring k has max(|x|,|y|)=k, but neighbors could be inside or outside.

Specifically, for (23,-22), max(|x|,|y|)=max(23,22)=23, so it's on the boundary of ring 23.

Now, neighbors:

- (22,-22): max(22,22)=22

- (24,-22): max(24,22)=24

- (23,-23): max(23,23)=23

- (23,-21): max(23,21)=23

- (22,-23): max(22,23)=23

- (22,-21): max(22,21)=22

- (24,-23): max(24,23)=24

- (24,-21): max(24,21)=24

Now, ring number for a cell: since each ring m consists of cells with max(|x|,|y|)=m.

So for a cell with max(|x|,|y|)=m, it is in ring m.

Ring m has numbers from first to last: first is (2m-1)^2 +1, last is (2m+1)^2.

As before.

Now, for each neighbor, we need to find its ring, then its position, then the number.

Since we have coordinates, we can compute the number directly from coordinates.

So we need a function f(x,y) that gives the number at (x,y).

To do that, we need to map coordinates to the spiral order.

Since we know the ring m = max(|x|,|y|), and within the ring, we can find where it is.

So, for a cell (x,y), let m = max(|x|,|y|).

Then it is in ring m.

The first number in ring m is a_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Now, we need to find the position within the ring.

The ring has four sides: right, top, left, bottom, but in order: up, left, down, right? In our path, for each ring, it goes: up, left, down, right.

But in our earlier, for ring k, it went up, left, down, right.

But k was the ring index, and m = max(|x|,|y|), so for ring m, same.

In our notation, ring m has max(|x|,|y|)=m.

Now, the path starts at (m, 1-m) , which is on the right side? For example m=2, (2,-1), which is right side, but y=-1, not top or bottom.

Actually, depending on the position.

To find where (x,y) is in ring m.

Note that:

- If |x| = m and |y| < m, then it's on the right or left side.

Specifically, if x = m, right side; if x = -m, left side.

- If |y| = m and |x| < m, then top or bottom: if y = m, top; if y = -m, bottom.

But in the path, the sides are traversed in order: first the "up" side, which is right side? In our case, for ring m, it starts at (m, 1-m), which is on the right edge, since x=m.

Then moves up, so along the right edge, from y=1-m to y=m.

Then moves left along the top edge, from x=m to x=-m, y=m.

Then moves down along the left edge, from y=m to y=-m, x=-m.

Then moves right along the bottom edge, from x=-m to x=m, y=-m.

Now, the corners: (m,m) is top-right, included in up side? In our earlier, for up side we included (m,y) from y=1-m to y=m, so includes (m,m).

Then left side: from (m,m) to (-m,m), but since (m,m) is already included, in the path it moves to (m-1,m), etc., but for assigning numbers, we need the sequence.

The total number of cells in ring m is 8m.

The path starts at (m,1-m), ends at (m,-m).

Now, the order:

1. Move up along x=m: from y=1-m to y=m. Number of cells: as before, from y=1-m to y=m inclusive, number is m - (1-m) + 1 = m -1 + m +1 = 2m.

The y-coordinates: min y = 1-m, max y = m, number of integers: m - (1-m) + 1 = 2m.

2. Then move left along y=m: from x=m to x=-m. But since it starts at (m,m), which is already included, so it moves to x=m-1, m-2, ..., -m. So x from m-1 down to -m. Number of cells: from x=m-1 to x=-m, inclusive? x starts at m-1, ends at -m, so values m-1, m-2, ..., -m. Number: from m-1 to -m, step -1, number is (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 +m +1 = 2m.

For example m=2: x from 2-1=1 to -2, so x=1,0,-1,-2? But -2 is included? x=1,0,-1,-2, that's four values, 2m=4, yes.

But earlier for left side we had (1,2),(0,2),(-1,2),(-2,2), yes.

3. Then move down along x=-m: from y=m to y=-m. Starts at (-m,m), which is just visited, so moves to y=m-1, m-2, ..., -m. So y from m-1 down to -m. Number: from y=m-1 to y=-m, inclusive, number is (m-1) - (-m) + 1 = m-1 +m +1 = 2m.

4. Then move right along y=-m: from x=-m to x=m. Starts at (-m,-m), just visited, moves to x=-m+1, -m+2, ..., m. So x from -m+1 to m. Number: m - (-m+1) + 1 = m + m -1 +1 = 2m.

Total: 2m + 2m + 2m + 2m = 8m, good.

Now, for a cell in ring m, we can find which side it's on and its offset.

Specifically:

- If it's on the up side: x=m, and y from 1-m to m.

- Left side: y=m, and x from m-1 down to -m? But since it moves from high x to low, but for indexing, we can list the range.

To compute the index within the ring.

The ring starts at (m,1-m) with number s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

Then, the path:

- First, up side: x=m, y increases from 1-m to m.

So y-coordinates: let y_min = 1-m, y_max = m.

The y-values: y_min, y_min+1, ..., y_max.

Number of cells: 2m.

The offset: the y-coordinate relative to min.

Set for a point on up side: offset = y - (1-m)

Then the index in this side is offset, from 0 to 2m-1? When offset=0, y=1-m, start, index 0.

Offset=1, y=1-m+1, next, index 1.

...

Offset=2m-1? y=1-m + (2m-1) = 1-m +2m -1 = m, yes, index 2m-1.

Since there are 2m cells, indices from 0 to 2m-1.

Then the number at (m,y) is s_m + offset = s_m + (y - (1-m))

Now, next side: left side. After up side ends at (m,m), which has index 2m-1 in up side, so number s_m + (2m-1)

Then left side starts: moves left along y=m, from x=m-1 down to x=-m? But in order: first to (m-1,m), then (m-2,m), ..., (-m,m).

So x decreases from m-1 to -m.

x-values: m-1, m-2, ..., -m.

Number: as above, 2m cells.

The first cell is (m-1,m), which is the first new cell.

So index in left side: 0 at (m-1,m), 1 at (m-2,m), ..., up to ( -m,m) at index ? 

x starts at m-1, ends at -m.

Set offset = (m-1) - x

When x=m-1, offset=0

x=m-2, offset=1

...

x=-m, offset = (m-1) - (-m) = m-1 + m = 2m-1

So index from 0 to 2m-1.

Then number: since up side ended at index 2m-1 of ring, so total so far 2m cells (up side), so left side starts at s_m + 2m

Then number at (x,m) is s_m + 2m + offset = s_m + 2m + ( (m-1) - x )

Now, next side: down side. After left side ends at (-m,m), which has index 2m-1 in left side, so number s_m + 2m + (2m-1) = s_m + 4m -1

Then down side: moves down along x=-m, from y=m-1 down to y=-m.

y-values: m-1, m-2, ..., -m.

First cell: (-m, m-1)

Index in down side: set offset = (m-1) - y ? Since y decreases.

When y=m-1, offset=0

y=m-2, offset=1

...

y=-m, offset = (m-1) - (-m) = m-1 + m = 2m-1

So index 0 to 2m-1.

Total cells so far: up 2m, left 2m, total 4m, so down side starts at s_m + 4m

Number at (-m,y) is s_m + 4m + offset = s_m + 4m + ( (m-1) - y )

Then last side: right side. After down side ends at (-m,-m), number s_m + 4m + (2m-1) = s_m + 6m -1

Then right side: moves right along y=-m, from x=-m+1 to x=m.

x-values: -m+1, -m+2, ..., m.

First cell: (-m+1, -m)

Index: set offset = x - (-m+1) = x + m -1

When x=-m+1, offset=0

x=-m+2, offset=1

...

x=m, offset = m - (-m+1) = m + m -1 = 2m-1

Starts at s_m + 6m? Total cells before: up 2m, left 2m, down 2m, total 6m, so right side starts at s_m + 6m

Number at (x,-m) is s_m + 6m + offset = s_m + 6m + (x + m - 1)

Now, summarize for ring m:

- If x = m and y >= 1-m and y <= m (up side), number = s_m + (y - (1-m))

- Else if y = m and x <= m-1 and x >= -m (left side), but since |y|=m and |x|<=m, but specifically for left side, y=m and x from -m to m-1? But in our case, x from -m to m-1, but since it's symmetric, but in the path, it's covered.

Note that:

- On right edge: x=m, |y| < m? But in up side, it includes y from 1-m to m, which for m>1, includes y=m and y=1-m, but |y| may be less than m in between, but at corners |y|=m.

In fact, for the up side, it covers all cells with x=m, regardless of y, as long as in ring m, which is |y|<=m, but since max(|x|,|y|)=m and x=m, so |y|<=m, and indeed in the range y=1-m to m.

Similarly for others.

But the corners are covered: (m,m) is in up side, (m,-m) is not in up side? For up side, y from 1-m to m, for m>1, 1-m < -m? Since 1-m < -m when 1<0? No, 1-m > -m always since 1>0.

For example m=2, y from 1-2=-1 to 2, so y=-1,0,1,2. Includes y=2 and y=-1.

But y=-m = -2, which is not included. Indeed, (2,-2) is on the bottom edge.

Similarly, (m,-m) is on the bottom edge, covered in the right side? In our case, right side is along y=-m.

So yes.

Now for our neighbor cells, we need to identify which side they are on, if any.

But some neighbors might be in different rings.

Specifically for our point (23,-22), ring m=23.

Now neighbors:

1. (22,-22)

2. (24,-22)

3. (23,-23)

4. (23,-21)

5. (22,-23)

6. (22,-21)

7. (24,-23)

8. (24,-21)

Now, compute their ring m = max(|x|,|y|)

1. (22,-22): |x|=22, |y|=22, max=22. So ring 22.

2. (24,-22): |x|=24, |y|=22, max=24. Ring 24.

3. (23,-23): |x|=23, |y|=23, max=23. Same ring.

4. (23,-21): |x|=23, |y|=21, max=23. Same ring.

5. (22,-23): |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23. Same ring.

6. (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22. Ring 22.

7. (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24. Ring 24.

8. (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24. Ring 24.

So, neighbors in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

In ring 23: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23)

(23,-21) and (22,-23) are in ring 23, yes.

List:

Same ring 23: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23)

But earlier I listed five: 3,4,5: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23)

But (22,-22) is in ring 22, etc.

The eight neighbors: 

- (22,-22): ring 22

- (24,-22): ring 24

- (23,-23): ring 23

- (23,-21): ring 23

- (22,-23): ring 23? |x|=22, |y|=23, max=23, yes ring 23

- (22,-21): |x|=22, |y|=21, max=22, ring 22

- (24,-23): |x|=24, |y|=23, max=24, ring 24

- (24,-21): |x|=24, |y|=21, max=24, ring 24

So, two in ring 22: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

Three in ring 23: (23,-23), (23,-21), (22,-23)

Three in ring 24: (24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21)

(23,-21) is listed, and (22,-23), but not (24,-22) etc.

Now, we need to compute the number for each.

First, recall s_m = (2m-1)^2 + 1

For ring m, first number is (2m-1)^2 + 1

Now, for each point, find which side it's on and compute the number.

Start with ring 23 points.

Our point is (23,-22), which is in ring 23.

Which side? x=23, y=-22.

Since x=m=23, and y between 1-m and m? 1-23=-22, and m=23.

y=-22, which is exactly 1-m = -22.

So it is on the up side, since x=m, and y=1-m.

In fact, it's the start of the ring, so number is s_{23} = (2*23 -1)^2 +1 = (46-1)^2 +1 = 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1 = 2026, which matches.

Now, neighbors in ring 23:

a. (23,-23): x=23, y=-23. Since x=m=23, so on up side? But y=-23, while range is y from 1-m=-22 to m=23. -23 < -22, so not in up side. Moreover, max(|x|,|y|)=max(23,23)=23, so in ring, but not on right edge? Since |x|=23, but |y|=23, so it's on the top or bottom? y=-23, so bottom? Specifically, since y=-m, it should be on the bottom edge, which is covered in the right side? In our sides, the bottom edge is the right side? Recall.

In ring m, the sides:

- Up side: x=m, y from 1-m to m

- Left side: y=m, x from m-1 down to -m? But y=m, not y=-m.

- Down side: x=-m, y from m-1 down to -m

- Right side: y=-m, x from -m+1 to m

Now, for (23,-23): x=23, y=-23. So |x|=23, |y|=23, so it could be corner.

Specifically, since y=-m, and |x|<=m, but here x=23=m, so it's the bottom-right corner? In our path, the bottom-right corner is where the ring ends, on the right side.

Indeed, for right side: y=-m, x from -m+1 to m.

So for m=23, y=-23, x from -23+1=-22 to 23.

So (23,-23) is included, since x=23.

In fact, it's the end point of the ring.

Now, which side? Right side, since y=-m.

So on the right side.

Now, for right side, number = s_m + 6m + (x + m - 1)

With m=23, s_m = s_{23} = 45^2 +1 = 2025 +1 = 2026? s_m is first of ring, but for right side, it starts later.

s_m is the first number, at (m,1-m)

For right side, it starts at s_m + 6m

And number = s_m + 6m + (x + m - 1)

Now, for (x,y) = (23,-23), so x=23, m=23.

So number = s_{23} + 6*23 + (23 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + (46 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + 45

Compute: 138 + 45 = 183, so 2026 + 183 = 2209.

But last number of ring 23 is (2*23 +1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209, yes, so it should be 2209, correct.

Now, next neighbor: (23,-21)

x=23, y=-21.

m=23.

x=m=23, so on right edge? Up side.

y=-21, which is between 1-m=-22 and m=23? -21 > -22, and -21 < 23, yes.

So on up side.

For up side, number = s_m + (y - (1-m)) = s_m + (y -1 + m)

s_m=2026, m=23, y=-21

So number = 2026 + (-21 -1 + 23) = 2026 + (-22 + 23) = 2026 + 1 = 2027

Since it's the next number after start.

Now, next neighbor: (22,-23)

x=22, y=-23.

m=max(22,23)=23.

Now, which side? |x|=22<23, |y|=23=m, and y=-23 <0, so bottom edge? Since y=-m.

So should be on the bottom edge, which is the right side? In our sides, the side with y=-m is the right side? But it's called "right side" but it's the bottom edge.

In the path, it's the last side, moving right along y=-m.

So yes, on the right side.

So number = s_m + 6m + (x + m - 1)

m=23, s_m=2026, x=22

So number = 2026 + 6*23 + (22 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + (45 -1)? 22+23-1=44? 22+23=45, minus 1 is 44.

x + m -1 =22+23-1=44

So 2026 + 138 + 44

2026 + 138 = 2164, plus 44=2208.

Since last number is 2209, and this is before it, should be 2208.

Now, we have three neighbors in ring 23: 

- (23,-23): 2209

- (23,-21): 2027

- (22,-23): 2208

Now, neighbors in ring 22.

Ring 22: s_{22} = (2*22 -1)^2 +1 = (44-1)^2 +1 = 43^2 +1 = 1849 +1 = 1850

Now, points: (22,-22) and (22,-21)

First, (22,-22): x=22, y=-22. m=22.

x=m=22, y=-22.

Now, range for up side: y from 1-m=1-22=-21 to m=22.

y=-22 < -21? -22 < -21, so not in up side.

y=-m, so on bottom edge? Right side.

Since y=-m, so on the right side (bottom edge).

So number = s_m + 6m + (x + m -1)

m=22, s_m=1850, x=22

Number = 1850 + 6*22 + (22 + 22 -1) = 1850 + 132 + (44 -1) = 1850 + 132 + 43

Compute: 132+43=175, 1850+175=2025.

Last number of ring 22 is (2*22 +1)^2 = 45^2=2025, yes, so it's the end, 2025.

Now, second point: (22,-21)

x=22, y=-21. m=22.

x=m=22, so on right edge? Up side.

y=-21, range: 1-m=-21 to 22? y=-21 >= -21 and <=22, yes.

So on up side.

Number = s_m + (y - (1-m)) = s_m + (y -1 + m)

s_m=1850, y=-21, m=22

Number = 1850 + (-21 -1 + 22) = 1850 + (-22 + 22) = 1850 + 0 = 1850? But that's the start.

y - (1-m) = -21 - (1-22) = -21 - (-21) = -21 +21=0, so index 0, so first number, 1850.

But is (22,-21) the start of ring 22?

Start of ring 22 is at (m,1-m)=(22,1-22)=(22,-21), yes exactly. So yes, 1850.

Now, neighbors in ring 24.

Ring 24: s_{24} = (2*24 -1)^2 +1 = (48-1)^2 +1 = 47^2 +1 = 2209 +1 = 2210

Points: (24,-22), (24,-23), (24,-21)

All have x=24, y=-22,-23,-21.

m=24.

All have x=m=24, so all on the up side? Since x=m.

Now, range for up side: y from 1-m=1-24=-23 to m=24.

So y=-22,-23,-21 all within -23 to 24? -23 <= y <=24, and -22,-23,-21 are all >= -23 and <=24, yes.

So all on the up side.

So for each, number = s_m + (y - (1-m)) = s_m + (y -1 + m)

m=24, s_m=2210

So for each:

a. (24,-22): y=-22, number = 2210 + (-22 -1 + 24) = 2210 + (-23 + 24) = 2210 + 1 = 2211

b. (24,-23): y=-23, number = 2210 + (-23 -1 + 24) = 2210 + (-24 + 24) = 2210 + 0 = 2210

c. (24,-21): y=-21, number = 2210 + (-21 -1 + 24) = 2210 + (-22 + 24) = 2210 + 2 = 2212

Now, we have all eight neighbors:

List them:

From ring 22:

- (22,-22): 2025

- (22,-21): 1850

From ring 23:

- (23,-23): 2209

- (23,-21): 2027

- (22,-23): 2208

From ring 24:

- (24,-22): 2211

- (24,-23): 2210

- (24,-21): 2212

Now, sum them up.

List the numbers:

1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212

Now, sum.

Note that we can group them.

First, the ring 22 neighbors: 1850 and 2025.

1850 + 2025 = 3875

Ring 23 neighbors: 2027, 2208, 2209

2027 + 2208 = 4235

4235 + 2209 = 6444? 4235 + 2200 = 6435, plus 9 is 6444.

2027 + 2208: 2000+2200=4200, 27+8=35, total 4235, yes. Then 4235 + 2209: 4235 + 2200 = 6435, +9=6444.

Ring 24 neighbors: 2210, 2211, 2212

These are consecutive: 2210,2211,2212.

Sum: 2210 + 2212 = 4422, plus 2211 = 4422 + 2211 = 6633? Better: average is 2211, times 3 = 6633.

2210 + 2211 + 2212 = 3*2211 = 6633, yes.

Now, total sum: ring22: 3875, ring23:6444, ring24:6633.

Sum: 3875 + 6444 = 10319

10319 + 6633 = 16952

Compute: 10319 + 6600 = 16919, plus 33 = 16952.

So sum is 16952.

But let me double-check the list.

Neighbors:

1. (22,-22): 2025

2. (24,-22): 2211

3. (23,-23): 2209

4. (23,-21): 2027

5. (22,-23): 2208

6. (22,-21): 1850

7. (24,-23): 2210

8. (24,-21): 2212

Now, write them in order: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Now sum:

Add sequentially.

Start with 1850 + 2025 = 3875

3875 + 2027 = 5902

5902 + 2208 = 8110

8110 + 2209 = 10319

10319 + 2210 = 12529

12529 + 2211 = 14740

14740 + 2212 = 16952

Same as before.

Notice that the numbers are symmetric in a way, but anyway.

So the sum is 16952.

But is this correct? Let me verify with a smaller example to make sure.

Suppose we take a small number, say neighbors of 2.

In the spiral, 2 is at (1,0)

Neighbors: same as neighbors of (1,0)

Adjacent: (0,0),(2,0),(1,-1),(1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(2,-1),(2,1)

Now, numbers: (0,0)=1, (2,0)? What is there? For ring m=max(|x|,|y|), (2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring 2.

s_2=(2*2-1)^2 +1=9+1=10? But (2,0) is 11? Earlier we had.

In grid: (1,0)=2, (0,0)=1, (2,0)=? After 9 at (1,-1), next is (2,-1)=10, then (2,0)=11, so (2,0)=11.

(1,-1)=9? But neighbors include (1,-1), which is 9.

List:

- (0,0):1

- (2,0):11? Assuming

- (1,-1):9? In ring1, (1,-1) is last,9

- (1,1):3

- (0,-1):8? (0,-1)=8

- (0,1):4

- (2,-1):10? Start of ring2

- (2,1):12? In ring2, (2,1)=12

So neighbors: (0,0)=1, (2,0)=11, (1,-1)=9, (1,1)=3, (0,-1)=8, (0,1)=4, (2,-1)=10, (2,1)=12

Sum: 1+11+9+3+8+4+10+12

Calculate: 1+11=12, 12+9=21, 21+3=24, 24+8=32, 32+4=36, 36+10=46, 46+12=58.

Now, according to our method, for 2 at (1,0), ring m=max(1,0)=1? |x|=1,|y|=0,max=1.

s_1=(2*1-1)^2 +1=1+1=2.

Neighbors:

(0,0): max(0,0)=0? Ring 0? Center.

Ring 0: only (0,0)=1.

(2,0): max(2,0)=2, ring2

(1,-1): max(1,1)=1? |x|=1,|y|=1,max=1, ring1

(1,1): same ring1

(0,-1): max(0,1)=1? |x|=0,|y|=1,max=1, ring1

(0,1): same, ring1

(2,-1): max(2,1)=2, ring2

(2,1): max(2,1)=2, ring2

Now, compute each:

Ring 0: (0,0)=1

Ring 1: points: (1,-1), (1,1), (0,-1), (0,1)

For (1,-1): x=1,y=-1,m=1

Which side? x=m=1, y=-1. Range up side: y from 1-m=0 to m=1? y=-1 <0? Not in up side.

y=-m? m=1, y=-1=-m, so on bottom edge? Right side.

Right side: y=-m=-1, x from -m+1=0 to m=1? x=0,1.

Number: s_m + 6m + (x + m -1) = s1 +6*1 + (x+1-1)=2+6+x=8+x

For (1,-1): x=1, number=8+1=9

For (0,-1): x=0, number=8+0=8

But (0,-1) is also in ring1, but we have it.

Now (1,1): x=1,y=1,m=1

x=m=1, y=1. Range up side: y from 0 to 1, includes y=1.

So on up side. Number= s_m + (y - (1-m)) =2 + (y -0) since 1-m=0? s_m + (y - (1-m)) =2 + (y - (1-1)) =2 + (y -0)=2+y

y=1, so 2+1=3

Similarly, (0,1): y=m=1? |y|=1=m, x=0<1, so on top edge? Left side.

Left side: y=m=1, x from m-1=0 down to -m=-1? x=0,-1.

Number: s_m + 2m + ( (m-1) - x ) =2 + 2*1 + ( (1-1) - x ) =2+2+(0 - x)=4 - x

For (0,1): x=0, number=4-0=4

For (-1,1): but not here.

Now ring 2: (2,0),(2,-1),(2,1)

(2,0): x=2,y=0,m=2

x=m=2, so up side? Range y from 1-2=-1 to 2. y=0 >=-1 and <=2, yes.

Number= s2 + (y - (1-m)) =10 + (0 - (1-2)) =10 + (0 - (-1)) =10+1=11

(2,-1): same, x=2,y=-1

Number=10 + (-1 - (1-2)) =10 + (-1 - (-1)) =10 + (-1+1)=10+0=10

(2,1): x=2,y=1,m=2

Number=10 + (1 - (1-2)) =10 + (1 - (-1)) =10+2=12

Same as before.

Sum: ring0:1, ring1:9,8,3,4? We have four points: (1,-1)=9, (0,-1)=8, (1,1)=3, (0,1)=4

But in neighbors, we have (1,-1), (1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), yes.

Sum:9+8+3+4=24? But earlier we had more.

Plus ring2: (2,0)=11, (2,-1)=10, (2,1)=12

Sum:11+10+12=33

Total: ring0:1, ring1:24? 9+8+3+4=24, ring2:33, total 1+24+33=58, matches our earlier sum.

In this case, for number 2, neighbors sum to 58.

Now back to our problem, we have sum 16952.

But is there any mistake? In our calculation for 2026, we have neighbors including 1850, which is the start of ring 22, and 2025 end of ring 22, etc.

Now, the numbers seem consistent.

Since the neighbors are symmetric, but in this case it's asymmetric because it's a corner.

But anyway, we computed all.

So sum is 16952.

But let me confirm the coordinates again.

Our point: (23,-22)

Neighbors:

- Left: (22,-22)

- Right: (24,-22)

- Down: (23,-23) since y decreases downward? Assuming y positive up, so down is more negative y.

In our coordinate, y increases up, so down is decreasing y.

So from (23,-22), down to (23,-23)

Up to (23,-21)

Then diagonals: down-left: (22,-23), etc.

We have all.

In the list, (22,-23) is included, which is left and down.

Now, numbers: we have 1850,2025,2027,2208,2209,2210,2211,2212.

Note that 1850 and 2025 are from ring 22, 2027,2208,2209 from ring 23, 2210,2211,2212 from ring 24.

2027 is in ring 23? (23,-21), which is above, so should be larger than 2026? 2027 is next, yes.

2208,2209 are near the end.

Sum seems reasonable.

Since we have the values, we can just sum as we did.

So total sum is 16952.

But let me write it as boxed.

So the answer should be 16952.

But is this correct? I recall that in the spiral, the neighbors might include numbers not directly adjacent if the spiral wraps, but in this grid, since it's a grid, neighbors are adjacent cells, so it should be fine.

In our small example, it worked.

Another check: for example, neighbors of 1.

1 at (0,0)

Neighbors: (1,0)=2, (-1,0)=6? In our grid, (-1,0)=6, (0,1)=4, (0,-1)=8, (1,1)=3, (1,-1)=9, (-1,1)=5, (-1,-1)=7

Sum:2+6+4+8+3+9+5+7= let's see: 2+6=8,8+4=12,12+8=20,20+3=23,23+9=32,32+5=37,37+7=44.

According to formula, but ring m=0, but neighbors are in ring1, all eight neighbors are in ring1.

s1=2, and we computed earlier: (1,0)=2, but wait, in ring1, (1,0) is on up side, number=s1 + (y-(1-m))=2+(0-(1-1))=2+(0-0)=2

(1,1)=3, as before

(0,1)=4

(-1,1)=5? x=-1,y=1,m=1, on left side? y=m=1, x=-1, which is within -1 to 0? Earlier left side: x from m-1=0 down to -m=-1, so x=0,-1.

Number for left side: s1 + 2m + ((m-1)-x)=2+2*1 + (0 - x)=4 - x

For (-1,1): x=-1, number=4 - (-1)=5

Similarly, (-1,0): x=-1,y=0,m=1? |x|=1,|y|=0<1? max=1, so on left edge? But x=-m, so on left edge? Down side? Since x=-m.

Down side: x=-m=-1, y from m-1=0 down to -m=-1? y=0,-1.

Number: s1 + 4m + ((m-1)-y)=2+4*1 + (0 - y)=6 - y

For (-1,0): y=0, number=6-0=6

For (-1,-1): y=-1, number=6 - (-1)=7

Then (0,-1): y=-1,m=1, on bottom? Right side? y=-m=-1, x=0? Since |y|=m, |x|<m? So on bottom edge? Right side? Right side: y=-1, x from -m+1=0 to m=1? x=0,1.

Number: s1 +6m + (x + m -1)=2+6*1 + (x+1-1)=8 + x

For (0,-1): x=0, number=8+0=8

For (1,-1): x=1, number=8+1=9

Same as before.

Sum:2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44, as computed.

Now, in our case, for 2026, sum is 16952, which seems plausible.

So I think it's correct.
</think>
The number 2026 is located at coordinates (23, -22) in the spiral grid, where the center (1) is at (0, 0), the x-axis increases to the right, and the y-axis increases upward.

The eight neighbors of (23, -22) are:
- Left: (22, -22)
- Right: (24, -22)
- Down: (23, -23)
- Up: (23, -21)
- Down-left: (22, -23)
- Down-right: (24, -23)
- Up-left: (22, -21)
- Up-right: (24, -21)

Each neighbor's ring (determined by \(m = \max(|x|, |y|)\)) and corresponding number are calculated as follows:

- **Ring 22 neighbors**:
  - (22, -22): \(m = 22\), on the right side (bottom edge), number = \(s_{22} + 6 \times 22 + (x + 22 - 1)\) where \(s_{22} = (2 \times 22 - 1)^2 + 1 = 43^2 + 1 = 1850\), so \(1850 + 132 + (22 + 22 - 1) = 1850 + 132 + 43 = 2025\).
  - (22, -21): \(m = 22\), on the up side, number = \(s_{22} + (y - (1 - 22)) = 1850 + (-21 - (-21)) = 1850 + 0 = 1850\).

- **Ring 23 neighbors**:
  - (23, -23): \(m = 23\), on the right side (bottom edge), number = \(s_{23} + 6 \times 23 + (x + 23 - 1)\) where \(s_{23} = (2 \times 23 - 1)^2 + 1 = 45^2 + 1 = 2026\), so \(2026 + 138 + (23 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + 45 = 2209\).
  - (23, -21): \(m = 23\), on the up side, number = \(s_{23} + (y - (1 - 23)) = 2026 + (-21 - (-22)) = 2026 + 1 = 2027\).
  - (22, -23): \(m = 23\), on the right side (bottom edge), number = \(s_{23} + 6 \times 23 + (x + 23 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + (22 + 23 - 1) = 2026 + 138 + 44 = 2208\).

- **Ring 24 neighbors**:
  - (24, -22): \(m = 24\), on the up side, number = \(s_{24} + (y - (1 - 24))\) where \(s_{24} = (2 \times 24 - 1)^2 + 1 = 47^2 + 1 = 2210\), so \(2210 + (-22 - (-23)) = 2210 + 1 = 2211\).
  - (24, -23): \(m = 24\), on the up side, number = \(s_{24} + (y - (1 - 24)) = 2210 + (-23 - (-23)) = 2210 + 0 = 2210\).
  - (24, -21): \(m = 24\), on the up side, number = \(s_{24} + (y - (1 - 24)) = 2210 + (-21 - (-23)) = 2210 + 2 = 2212\).

The neighbor numbers are: 1850, 2025, 2027, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212.

Summing these values:
\[
1850 + 2025 = 3875
\]
\[
3875 + 2027 = 5902
\]
\[
5902 + 2208 = 8110
\]
\[
8110 + 2209 = 10319
\]
\[
10319 + 2210 = 12529
\]
\[
12529 + 2211 = 14740
\]
\[
14740 + 2212 = 16952
\]

The sum of all eight neighbors of 2026 is 16952.

\boxed{16952}
