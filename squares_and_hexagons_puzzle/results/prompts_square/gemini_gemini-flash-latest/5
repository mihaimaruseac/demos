The problem asks for the sum of the 8 neighbors of the number $N_0 = 2026$ arranged on a square spiral grid.

First, we locate $N_0 = 2026$ in the spiral. The numbers $M_L = (2L+1)^2$ lie at the Southeast (SE) corners $(L, -L)$ of layer $L$.

We find $L$ such that $M_{L-1} < 2026 \le M_L$.
$L=22$: $M_{22} = (2 \cdot 22 + 1)^2 = 45^2 = 2025$.
$L=23$: $M_{23} = (2 \cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$.

$N_{2025} = M_{22}$ is located at $(22, -22)$.
The spiral expands outward. Layer $L=23$ starts immediately after $M_{22}$. The path proceeds East (Right).

The starting movement for layer $L$ from $M_{L-1}$ involves 1 step East to reach $x=L$.
$N_0 = 2026$ is at $(22+1, -22) = (23, -22)$.

We identify the coordinates of the 8 neighbors relative to $(x_0, y_0) = (23, -22)$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
$A(22, -21)$ & $B(23, -21)$ & $C(24, -21)$ \\
\hline
$D(22, -22)$ & 2026 & $E(24, -22)$ \\
\hline
$F(22, -23)$ & $G(23, -23)$ & $H(24, -23)$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We determine the value of each neighbor based on its position relative to the layers:

1. **Neighbor D (22, -22):** This is the SE corner of $L=22$.
$D = M_{22} = 2025$.

2. **Neighbors B (23, -21) and G (23, -23):** These are on the $x=23$ line, which defines the path for $L=23$.
Since 2026 is at $(23, -22)$, the spiral immediately turns North (N).
$B = N(23, -21) = 2026 + 1 = 2027$.

The path continues North towards the NE corner (23, 23), then West, South, and finally East along $y=-23$.
$G = N(23, -23)$ is the SE corner of $L=23$.
$G = M_{23} = 2209$.

3. **Neighbors F (22, -23):** This is also on the $y=-23$ line, which is the East segment of $L=23$.
Since $G(23, -23)=2209$ is the end point of the East segment (where $x$ is maximum), moving West corresponds to decreasing the number.
$F = N(22, -23) = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.

4. **Neighbors H (24, -23), E (24, -22), C (24, -21):** These coordinates have $x=24$, meaning they belong to layer $L=24$.
Layer $L=24$ starts from $M_{23}=2209$ at $(23, -23)$. The path moves East (R) 1 step, then North (N).
$H = N(24, -23)$: First step East for $L=24$. $H = 2209 + 1 = 2210$.
$E = N(24, -22)$: Next step North. $E = 2210 + 1 = 2211$.
$C = N(24, -21)$: Next step North. $C = 2211 + 1 = 2212$.

5. **Neighbor A (22, -21):** This neighbor is inside layer $L=22$.
$M_{21} = 1849$ is at $(21, -21)$. Layer $L=22$ starts by moving East from $M_{21}$.
$A = N(22, -21)$: $A = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.

The 8 neighbors are:
$\{1850, 2027, 2212, 2025, 2211, 2208, 2209, 2210\}$.

We calculate the sum $S$:
$S = 1850 + 2027 + 2212 + 2025 + 2211 + 2208 + 2209 + 2210$.

Group the numbers:
1850
$2025 + 2027 = 4052$
$2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212$.
Let $Y = 2210$. The sum of these five numbers is $5Y + (-2 - 1 + 0 + 1 + 2) = 5Y = 5(2210) = 11050$.

$S = 1850 + 4052 + 11050$
$S = 5902 + 11050 = 16952$.
