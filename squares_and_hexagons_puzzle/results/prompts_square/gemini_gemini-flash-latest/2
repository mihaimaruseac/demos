The spiral is laid out such that the maximum value $M_k$ in a square of side length $2k+1$ is $M_k = (2k+1)^2$. These maximum values $M_k$ occur at the bottom-right corner $(k, -k)$.

We first locate the number $N = 2026$.
We find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2$.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, we have $k=22$. $M_{22} = 2025$.
$M_{22}$ is located at $(22, -22)$.

$N = 2026$ is the number immediately following $M_{22}$. It starts Layer $k=23$.
The path moves Right from $M_{22}$ by one step to start the new layer.
The location of $N=2026$ is $(x_N, y_N) = (23, -22)$.

Since $N=2026$ starts the Segment 2 (Upward movement, $S$ in the notation used in thought process) of Layer 23, the path proceeds upwards:
$2027$ is at $(23, -21)$. (Neighbor A, Above)

We identify the 8 neighbors based on their coordinates relative to $(23, -22)$.

1. **Left (L): (22, -22)**
This is $M_{22} = 2025$.

2. **Above (A): (23, -21)**
This is the next number in the spiral: $2026 + 1 = 2027$.

3. **Bottom (B): (23, -23)**
This point has $|x|=23, |y|=23$, meaning it is the corner of Layer 23. Since $M_{23}$ is always at $(k, -k)$, this is $M_{23}$.
$M_{23} = 47^2 = 2209$.

4. **Bottom Left (BL): (22, -23)**
This number is just before $M_{23}$ in the spiral path, lying on the segment moving Right towards $M_{23}$.
$V_{BL} = M_{23} - 1 = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.

5. **Bottom Right (BR): (24, -23)**
This number is $M_{23} + 1$. It starts Layer 24.
$V_{BR} = 2209 + 1 = 2210$.

6. **Right (R): (24, -22)**
This number is $M_{23} + 2$. Layer 24 starts at 2210 at $(24, -23)$ and moves R for 1 step, then moves Up. $2211$ is the first step Up.
$V_R = 2211$.

7. **Above Right (AR): (24, -21)**
This number is $M_{23} + 3$. It follows $V_R$ in the upward path of Layer 24.
$V_{AR} = 2212$.

8. **Above Left (AL): (22, -21)**
This coordinate belongs to Layer 22 ($k=22$). It is on the column $x=22$.
We found that the segment moving Up in Layer 22 (from $x=22, y=-21$ to $y=22$) starts at $M_{21} + 1$.
$M_{21} = 43^2 = 1849$.
$V_{AL} = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.

The 8 neighboring values are:
$L = 2025$
$A = 2027$
$B = 2209$
$BL = 2208$
$BR = 2210$
$R = 2211$
$AR = 2212$
$AL = 1850$

The sum $S$ is:
$$S = 2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212 + 1850$$

Group the terms:
$$S = (2025 + 2027) + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212) + 1850$$
$$S = 4052 + (5 \times 2210) + 1850$$
$$S = 4052 + 11050 + 1850$$
$$S = 15102 + 1850$$
$$S = 16952$$

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16952.
