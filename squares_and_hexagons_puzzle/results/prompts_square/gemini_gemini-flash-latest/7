The number 2026 is located on a spiral laid out on a square grid. We first need to determine the layer $k$ and coordinates $(x, y)$ of 2026.

The square numbers $(2k+1)^2$ lie at the bottom right corner $(k, -k)$.
We find $k$ such that $(2k-1)^2 < 2026 \le (2k+1)^2$.
Since $45^2 = 2025$, let $2k+1 = 45$. This yields $k=22$.
$M_{22} = 2025$. This number is located at $(22, -22)$.

Since $2026 = M_{22} + 1$, 2026 is the starting number of the next layer, $k=23$.
The spiral proceeds from $M_{k-1}$ (here 2025) by moving one step Right (R), then $2k-1$ steps Up (U), $2k$ steps Left (L), $2k$ steps Down (D), and $2k$ steps Right (R) to reach $M_k$.

1.  **Locate 2026 (P):**
    $2026$ is one step Right from $(22, -22)$.
    $P = (23, -22)$.

2.  **Determine the coordinates and values of the 8 neighbors.**
    Let $P=(x_P, y_P) = (23, -22)$.

    We analyze the positions based on their relationship to layer $k=23$. The layer boundary for $k=23$ is $|x| \le 23$ and $|y| \le 23$.

    **A. Neighbor to the West:** $(22, -22)$.
    This is $M_{22}$. $A = 2025$.

    **C. Neighbor to the North:** $(23, -21)$.
    The spiral moves Up (U) immediately from 2026. $C = 2026 + 1 = 2027$.

    **D. Neighbor to the South:** $(23, -23)$.
    This is the bottom-right corner of Layer 23, $M_{23} = (2\cdot 23 + 1)^2 = 47^2 = 2209$. $D = 2209$.

    **G. Neighbor South-West:** $(22, -23)$.
    $G$ is on the bottom edge of Layer 23, immediately to the left of $D=2209$.
    $G = 2209 - 1 = 2208$.

    **H. Neighbor South-East:** $(24, -23)$.
    Since $x=24$, this point belongs to Layer $k=24$.
    $H$ is one step Right from $M_{23}=2209$. $H$ is the starting number of layer 24.
    $H = 2209 + 1 = 2210$.

    **B. Neighbor to the East:** $(24, -22)$.
    The spiral moves Up from $H=2210$. $B$ is the next number generated.
    $B = 2210 + 1 = 2211$.

    **F. Neighbor North-East:** $(24, -21)$.
    $F$ is the next number in the Up path of Layer 24.
    $F = 2211 + 1 = 2212$.

    **E. Neighbor North-West:** $(22, -21)$.
    This point is inside $k=23$, specifically on the boundary of $k=22$.
    $E$ is located at $(k', -k'+1)$ where $k'=22$. This is the position $M_{21}+1$.
    $M_{21} = 43^2 = 1849$.
    $E = 1849 + 1 = 1850$.

3.  **Calculate the sum (S):**
    The 8 neighbors are:
    $N_1 = 2025$ (A)
    $N_2 = 2027$ (C)
    $N_3 = 2209$ (D)
    $N_4 = 1850$ (E)
    $N_5 = 2212$ (F)
    $N_6 = 2208$ (G)
    $N_7 = 2210$ (H)
    $N_8 = 2211$ (B)

    $S = 2025 + 2027 + 2209 + 1850 + 2212 + 2208 + 2210 + 2211$

    $S = (2025 + 2027) + 1850 + (2208 + 2209 + 2210 + 2211 + 2212)$
    $S = 4052 + 1850 + 11050$
    $S = 5902 + 11050$
    $S = 16952$.

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 2026 is 16952.
