The neighbor numbers in a spiral will have a fixed difference with the main number based on their positions. 

Top left corner will be -n
Top center will be -n + 1
Top right corner will be -n + 2 
Middle left will be -n + 3
Middle right will be -n - 1
Bottom left corner will be -n - 2
Bottom center will be -n - 3 
Bottom right corner will be -n - 4.

where n is the current layer of the spiral we are in. 

We can find out n given that in the nth layer, the maximum number present is (2n+1)^2. Therefore, we need n such that (2n+1)^2 > 2026 and (2(n-1)+1)^2 < 2026. 

Solving this inequality gives 31 < n < 32. Thus, n = 32. 

The sum of all 8 neighbors of the number 

= 2026 - 32 - 32 + 1 - 32 + 2 - 32 + 3 - 32 - 1 - 32 - 2 - 32 - 3 - 32 - 4
= 2026 - 8*32
= 2026 - 256
= 1770.
