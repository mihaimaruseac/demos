The structure of the spiral should make it close to an arithmetic series since the numbers that surround 2026 are in the same 'shell' of the spiral, except the one directly before. Therefore, to calculate the sum of the 8 neighbors, it's just 8*2026 = 16208 since 7 neighbors lie in the same shell, and the 1 which is the last number of the previous shell is 2026 - 1 which is 2025. So the total sum is 16208 + 2025 = 18233.
