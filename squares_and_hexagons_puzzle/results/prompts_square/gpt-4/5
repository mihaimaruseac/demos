Each cycle around the spiral has an odd square at the center and four even squares at the corners. The four even squares in a cycle are consecutive even numbers. Suppose that the square with the odd number $n^2$ is at the center of a cycle. Its four corners are then \[
n^2-n+2,\quad n^2-n+4,\quad n^2+n+2,\quad n^2+n+4.
\] The first two of these numbers appear below the center and the last two numbers appear above the center. All larger numbers in the same cycle are two more positions clockwise.

Because $n^2=n^2-n+4<(2026)<n^2+n+2=(2n+1)^2-n+2$ when $n=45$, the number $2026$ lies in the same cycle as the square $2025$ and it lies somewhere above the center of the spiral. It is $n+1$ positions clockwise from $n^2+n+2$. Thus, $2026$ is $45+1=46$ positions clockwise from $2025+45+2=2072$.

It is a simple matter now to compute its eight neighbors in the spiral. Four adjacent numbers in the spiral will be $2026\pm 1$ and $2026 \pm 45$. The other four neighbors are the four corners of a smaller cycle. Those must be he four corners nearest $2026$, namely $2025 - 45 + 2$, $2025 - 45 + 4$, $2025 + 45 + 2$, and $2025 + 45 + 4$.

The eight neighbors of $2026$ are \[
2025,\ 2027,\ 1981,\ 2071,\ 1982,\ 1984,\ 2072,\ 2074
\] and the sum of these eight numbers is $\boxed{16316}$.
