The four corners of the $2\times 2$ square surrounding 2026 are easily found, and the four numbers on the sides of the square turn out to be separated from the corners by $+1$ (for the two on the left) and $-1$ (for the two on the right). Therefore, the sum is equal to $4 \cdot 2026 + 2 - 2 = \boxed{8102}$.
