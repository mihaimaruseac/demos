The number 2026 is on a diagonal line on the grid. Since it's an even number, it would be on the lower right diagonal. The number 1 is in the first square, numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9 are in the second square, numbers 13, 15, 17, and 19 are in the third square, numbers 25, 27, 29, and 31 are in the fourth square, and so on. In general, for the nth square, the numbers at the four corners are (4n^2-3n+1), (4n^2-1n+1), (4n^2+1n+1), and (4n^2+3n+1).

Since 2026 is on the lower right diagonal, it can be represented as (4n^2+3n+1) for some n. Solving this equation gives n = 32. Therefore, 2026 is at the corner of the 32nd square.

The eight neighbors of 2026 are (4*32^2-1*32+1), (4*32^2+1*32+1), (4*32^2+5*32+1), (4*33^2-3*33+1), (4*33^2-1*33+1), (4*31^2+3*31+1), (4*31^2+5*31+1), and (4*32^2+7*32+1).

Adding these eight numbers together gives 16439.
