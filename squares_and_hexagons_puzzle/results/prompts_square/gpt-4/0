The sum of all 8 of a number's neighbors on a square spiral is 8 times that number. The reason for this is that the number directly to the right of n is n+1, the number directly above that is n+2, etc, continuing the pattern until the number directly to the right of n on the same row is n+8. These all sum to 8n+36, which simplifies to 8(n+4). For n+4's on the outer edge of the spiral, the neighboring number in the counterclockwise direction is lower by 1, hence the sum is 8(n+4) - 8 = 8n, which is 8 times the original number.

So for the number 2026, its neighbors sum to 8 * 2026 = 16208.
