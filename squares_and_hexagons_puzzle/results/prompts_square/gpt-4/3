The spiral pattern forms layers, with the number 1 at the center in the first layer, the numbers 2 to 9 in the second layer, 10 to 25 in the third layer, and so forth. Each layer is a square with side length n where n is an odd number. The highest number in each layer is n^2. Therefore, we can find out which layer the number 2026 is in by finding the smallest n such that n^2 >= 2026, where n is odd.

We find that 45^2 = 2025 and 47^2 = 2209. Therefore, 2026 is in the 46th layer (counting from the center). This layer starts with the number 2026 and ends with 2209. Also, notice that the four corners of this layer are the largest number in the four layers: 2025 (45^2), 2047 (45^2 + 22*1), 2071 (45^2 + 22*2), 2097 (45^2 + 22*3), and 2125 (45^2 + 22*4 = 46^2). 

Since 2026 falls between 2025 and 2047, it is in the top row of this layer. The neighbors of 2026 are 2025, 2024 (from the row above) and 2048, 2027, 2026, 2025, 2047 (from the row below). 

The sum of these 8 neighbors is 2025 + 2024 + 2048*2 + 2027*2 + 2026 + 2025 + 2047 = 2*(2048 + 2027 + 2026+ 2025) + 2024 + 2047 = 41,366.
