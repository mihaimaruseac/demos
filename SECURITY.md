# Security Policy

Even though the repository contains demos, I strive to keep everything updated
to remove security vulnerabilities.

The only exception is if the demo is explicitly targetting a specific
vulnerability, in which case it should be marked as such, in an unambigous
manner. Even in this case, if there is a security vulnerability affecting this
demo that is not relevant to the vulnerability the demo shows, I will attempt
to fix it.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Private vulnerability reporting should be enabled for the repository. Please
use this to report any vulnerability.

Alternatively, please email me details of the vulnerability.
