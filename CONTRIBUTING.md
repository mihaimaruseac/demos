# Contributing

Since this repo contains mostly demos of stuff present on [my
blog](https://mihai.page), adding new features is something that happens
rarely. If a demo turns out to be useful, I would extract it as a separate
project, or, you are free to fork that demo, as long as the license is
respected.

PRs are welcome to fix security issues, or for dependency updates or upgrading
to more modern versions of the code.
